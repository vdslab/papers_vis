      "abstract": "Despite the incessant progress observed in fixed and wireless terrestrial communication networks, satellite systems remain an appealing solution for broadcasting, point-to-point, and multicasting telecommunications, because of undemanding customer equipment and wide coverage capability. In this scenario, digital video broadcasting via satellite (DVB-S) is recognized as one of the main market-attractive telecommunication fields. Up to now, expensive discrete GaAs HEMT or FET devices have been used to build up circuitry for satellite applications at Ku-band. This article presents the first 12-GHz monolithic receiver for DVB-S applications, implemented in a low-cost silicon bipolar technology. The receiver is based on a superheterodyne architecture, employing a fully integrated LO. To comply with the severe LO phase noise requirement of -101 dBc/Hz at a 100 kHz offset from the carrier, an innovative VCO topology was used implementing a three-metal-layer integrated transformer. The performance parameters of the integrated receiver fulfill DVB-S standard specifications.",

      "abstract": "Coupled with a robust and efficient OFDM air interface, MIMO technologies lead to a very compelling high-speed data downlink solution for future wireless systems. This article presents Nortel Networks' MIMO-OFDM concept prototype and measured performance results. This prototype has been developed in the framework of a Nortel Networks system concept for 3G evolution systems and next-generation wide area wireless networks. The prototype is based on a shared access MIMO-OFDM physical layer in the downlink, supporting adaptive modulation and coding, with peak rates up to 37 Mb/s. The uplink is based on an enhanced UMTS WCDMA physical layer. Performance for the high-speed downlink has been measured under various emulated fading conditions. The measured performance illustrates the robustness of OFDM in frequency-selective channels and high-speed mobility channels, supporting speeds as high as 200 km/h. The prototype can also be used for over-the-air assessment of the technology.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to present a distributed computing framework that is used as a purely Web-based simulation environment for antenna array modeling. The framework adopts a three-tier architecture. The front-end part is mainly based on dynamic Web pages for the selection of antenna parameters, enhanced by the VRML standard for visualization of the geometry and results. The middle part of the architecture is based on Java servlets, which are responsible for handling the front-end communication with the remote user and setting up the simulation. Finally, the back end of the architecture is responsible to distribute the computations to a set of computing nodes. This part employs a purely Web-based mobile agent platform, responsible for the execution of partial simulation code to remote hosts. In the context of the article we demonstrate the applicability of the framework in antenna array modeling by presenting a specific parametric simulation of conformal antenna arrays.",

      "abstract": "Passive optical networks bring high-speed broadband access via fiber to the business, curb and home. Among various types of PONs, Ethernet PONs are gaining more and more attention since they are built on widely used Ethernet technology and can offer high bandwidth, low cost and broad services. EPONs use a point-to-multipoint topology, in which multiple optical network units share one uplink channel to transmit multimedia traffic to a control element, the optical line terminal. To avoid data collision on the shared uplink channel, a key issue in EPONs is a contention-free MAC protocol for the OLT to schedule the transmission order of different ONUs. In this article we first review some DBA schemes available in the literature, then propose a two-layer bandwidth allocation scheme that implements weight based priority for this need. To maximally satisfy the requests of all ONUs and provide differentiated services, an ONU is allowed to request bandwidth for all its available traffic, and all traffic classes proportionally share the bandwidth based on their instantaneous demands. The weight set for each class not only prevents high-priority traffic from monopolizing the bandwidth under heavy load but also ensures a minimum bandwidth allocated to each traffic class.",

However, commonalities between the two most popular infrastructures, mobile cellular and TV broadcast, are such that a common framework for services and QoS management can be built, without the expense of starting from scratch in the design of a universal system able to connect users for communications and entertainment.

      "abstract": "The survivability of IP over WDM networks gains importance as network traffic keeps growing. Recovery at the lowest layer is fast and scalable. However, it is usually considered to provide poor network utilization. In this article we propose a resilience scheme based on recovery at the lowest layer in which intralayer and interlayer backup resource sharing is utilized to improve the network utilization. By applying interlayer backup resource sharing, we can totally depend on the reserved backup resources for fiber link failures to guarantee 100 percent recovery of IP router failures. In addition, by applying intralayer backup resource sharing, the network utilization improvement of recovery at the lowest layer is much more significant than at the highest layer. Simulations results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently improve network utilization and be even more capacity-efficient than resilience schemes based on recovery at the highest layer.",

      "abstract": "Internet-based communication is assuming an increasingly important role in the developing world. It is thus crucial that students be exposed to contemporary networking equipment in a realistic setting, in order to connect theoretical material taught in lecture courses with the realities of physical hardware. To this end, a large computer networking laboratory has been set up to provide a realistic environment for teaching internetworking concepts. This laboratory provides university-level students with a testbed to experiment with fundamental issues of internetworking in a way that cannot be provided by simulators and to a degree of rigor not possible with the commonly available laboratory setups designed for technicians. We describe the motivations for setting up the laboratory, its network structure and equipment, and the type of experiments students conduct. The laboratory structure is influenced heavily by the limited funds at our disposal - a common problem in the developing world. Many of the problems we faced in setting up our equipment (such as the crucial impact of proper electrical grounding on system performance) are not ordinarily encountered in developed nations.

      "abstract": "Several strategies have been proposed recently to improve the performance of the location management scheme in mobile systems, the influence of mobility on network performance must be reduced, mainly due to the huge number of mobile hosts in conjunction with the small cell size. In this article we present a profile-based strategy (PBS) to reduce location update signaling cost by increasing the intelligence of the location procedure. This strategy associates with each user a list of cells where she is likely to be at a given probability in each time interval. The implementation of this strategy has been subject to extensive evaluation. The results obtained confirm the effectiveness of PBS in significantly reducing the costs of both location updates and call delivery procedures when compared to IS-41 and other well-known strategies in the literature.",

      "abstract": "A real-time testbed based on the technology of software radio is adopted to efficiently evaluate cutting-edge technologies in wireless communications, and thus becomes a valuable tool for both academic research and system prototyping. In this article we describe a software radio testbed, established in the software radio laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology, used to implement a physical layer similar to IEEE 802.11a space-time coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. The testbed consists of a 2 x 2 multiple-input multiple-output configuration with powerful digital signal processor chains, high-speed data exchange interfaces, and many advanced subsystem modules, such as high-speed high-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, digital up/downconverters, and wideband RF transmit and receive front-ends with synchronous channels and programmable settings. The design methodology and implementation for key algorithms, such as time, sampling, and frequency synchronization, and channel estimation and compensation are discussed. The experimental data obtained from a typical indoor environment demonstrates that the prototype is capable of providing 30 Mb/s peak data rate, operating at the central frequency of 2.435 GHz with a spectral occupancy of 6.25 MHz. Spatial-temporal diversity gain associated with space-time coding is verified by the experimental results.",

With this technology, the problem of finding the best server to respond to a request becomes a virtual noop. Hindered by unresolved issues and the slow deployment of IPv6, network-layer anycast is still not a reality. However, an increase in interest and research surrounding anycast recently warrants a look at the state and direction of the ideas in this area. This article describes some of the major problems with network-layer anycast and their possible solutions, as well as some optimizations and applications that have been developed recently.",

      "abstract": "This article provides an overview of AT&amp;T's MPLS OAM architecture, and gives examples of operational experience. Hallmarks of the architecture are a single, converged, and integrated MPLS/optical network, and the evolution to fully automated, zero-touch network operation. The concept of one converged IP/MPLS architecture will reduce operations, development, and capital costs. The concept of zero aims to bring full automation for every human-to-computer interaction currently required for setting up and maintaining network services, delivering services to customers in real time with zero defects and cycle time, and supporting both a network as well as an operational environment with six nines reliability. This approach effectively opens the network to the customer, enabling new levels of customer network management, service creation, and ordering, and empowering enterprise customers with the tools to create their own network services as they transform their own internal networks. In the article we describe AT&amp;T's MPLS-enabled services, the corresponding MPLS operations architecture (including MPLS MIBs), our MPLS OAM operational experience, and MPLS OAM evolution needs for MPLS MIB enhancements and new network capabilities. By applying technologies such as artificial intelligence, self-healing/self-identifying network elements, expert systems, rules-based processes, and automatic speech recognition, the architecture will migrate from a predictive network that monitors, correlates, and recommends action; to an adaptive network that monitors, correlates, and takes action; to a cybernated network that has integrated components that dynamically manage by business rules and policies. We give several examples of how AT&amp;T is already investing in and implementing this future vision, and conclude by challenging network researchers, developers, and key industry players to apply new technologies in fully realizing the operational vision.",

      "abstract": "A plethora of metropolitan area wavelength-division multiplexing networks have been proposed and examined in recent years with the aim to alleviate the bandwidth bottleneck between increasingly higher-speed local/access networks and high-speed backbone networks. Many of the considered metropolitan area networks use the arrayed waveguide grating as an optical building block. As we review in this article, in ring, interconnected ring, and meshed metro WDM networks, the AWG is typically used to realize wavelength multiplexers, demultiplexers, or optical add-drop multiplexers without capitalizing on spatial wavelength reuse. By using the AWG as a wavelength router, highly efficient star metro WDM networks can be realized due to extensive spatial wavelength reuse. We give an overview of star metro WDM networks that are able to meet modular upgradability, transparency, flexibility, efficiency, reliability, and protection requirements of future metro networks. AWG-based star networks also enable an evolution path of ring networks toward highly efficient and fault-tolerant hybrid star-ring metro network solutions.",

      "abstract": "Existing transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP are designed specifically for point-to-point communication. The increased popularity of peer-to-peer networking has brought changes in the Internet that provided users with potentially multiple replicated sources for content retrieval. However, applications that leverage such parallelism have thus far been limited to non-real-time file downloads. In this article we consider the problem of multipoint-to-point video streaming over peer-to-peer networks. We present a transport layer protocol called R/sup 2/CP that effectively enables real-time multipoint-to-point video streaming. R/sup 2/CP is a receiver-driven multistate transport protocol. It requires no coordination between multiple sources, accommodates flexible application layer reliability semantics, uses TCP-friendly congestion control, and delivers to the video stream the aggregate of the bandwidths available on the individual paths. Simulation results show great performance benefits using R/sup 2/CP in peer-to-peer networks.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, the tremendous growth in the mobile Internet user population has been accompanied by an equally exciting evolution in wireless data networks. However, quite understandably, the evolution has been distinctly characterized by an increasing degree of heterogeneity along several dimensions such as the access technology, network model, device, and application requirements. This heterogeneity, in turn, imposes a significant challenge on the design of the network protocol stack, and leads to the question: how can the protocol stack at a mobile host cater effectively to the heterogeneous characteristics of the operating environment? In this article we provide an overview of AdaptNet, an adaptive protocol suite for next-generation wireless data networks. AdaptNet consists of protocol solutions at different layers of the protocol stack addressing several problems, including rate adaptation, congestion control, mobility support, and coding. A common underlying theme in the design of the protocols in the AdaptNet suite is adaptiveness to the operating environment. Through high-level discussions, preliminary results, and pointers to relevant related work, we show how AdaptNet achieves the goal of effectively addressing heterogeneity in next-generation wireless data networks.",

      "abstract": "Adaptive antennas are recognized as a means of increasing the performance of communications systems. However, practical realization of such systems relies on suitable calibration of distortion effects caused by the circuitry and antenna structures. This work presents a detailed analysis of the classes of distortion that degrade the performance of adaptive antennas. This uses the results of an adaptive antenna testbed employing an eight-element circular array to illustrate the impact of temperature on performance. Design techniques that aid calibration are then described. In particular, digital downconversion, array design, harmonic sampling, sample clock dither, and clock management are discussed as a means of designing an adaptive array with the calibration problem in mind.",

      "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication techniques have been an important area of focus for next-generation wireless systems because of their potential for high capacity, increased diversity, and interference suppression. For applications such as wireless LANs and cellular telephony, MIMO systems will likely be deployed in environments where a single base must communicate with many users simultaneously. As a result, the study of multi-user MIMO systems has emerged recently as an important research topic. Such systems have the potential to combine the high capacity achievable with MIMO processing with the benefits of space-division multiple access. In this article we review several algorithms that have been proposed with this goal in mind. We describe two classes of solutions. The first uses a signal processing approach with various types of transmitter beamforming. The second uses \"dirty paper\" coding to overcome the interference a user sees from signals intended for other users. We conclude by describing future areas of research in multi-user MIMO communications.",

      "abstract": "QoS has been the dominating issue faced in VoIP development today. In this article we investigate and empirically evaluate three DiffServ (Kilkki 1999, Blake et al. 1998) design strategies, WRED Dropper (Cisco Systems), PQ meter, and multiple differentiated meter (MDM), and study how multilevel communication services can be guaranteed for multiple VoIP classes. The novel aspect of our work is that we are trying to provide solutions with the use of features that are not currently available in real routers (Westhead, 2002). By taking advantage of network simulation techniques, a series of experiments have been designed and carried out under different network conditions by using the intersim simulation tool (Westhead, 2002). Our simulation results effectively reflect that: 1) all three designs can provide service differentiation for multiple VoIP classes; 2) the highest-priority VoIP class can always be protected under catastrophic congestion; and 3) each design has some pros and cons in terms of performance stability under varied traffic distribution and changed packet size mix. Based on this investigation, we conclude that MDM is comparatively better at providing even service distribution and staying robust against traffic distribution variation and packet size changes.",

The focus of this article is to address quality of service support for VR services in the context of the UMTS QoS framework specified by the 3G standardization forum, the Third Generation Partnership Project. We propose a classification of VR services based on delivery requirements (real-time or non-real-time) and degree of interactivity that maps to existing UMTS QoS classes and service attributes. The mapping is based on matching VR service requirements to performance parameters and target values defined for UMTS applications. Test cases involving heterogeneous VR applications are defined, using as a reference a general model for VR service design and delivery. Measurements of network parameters serve to determine the end-to-end QoS requirements of the considered applications, which are in turn mapped to proposed VR service classes.",

      "abstract": "Jitter is timing noise that causes bit errors in high-speed data transmission lines. If the data rate of a system is increased, the magnitude of jitter measured in seconds is roughly unchanged, but measured as a fraction of a bit period, it increases proportionally with the data rate and causes errors. Emerging technologies require the ratio of the number of errors to the total number of transmitted bits (the bit error rate, BER) to be less than one in a trillion (10/sup -12/). As datacom, bus, and backplane data rates have increased, many different techniques for characterizing jitter have been introduced, each using a variety of different types of laboratory equipment. To fix difficult jitter problems at high data rates, engineers need to understand the diverse jitter analysis techniques used in both synchronous and asynchronous networking. The article focuses on data rates of emerging technologies above 3 Gb/s. Below 3 Gb/s, real-time oscilloscopes can capture a contiguous data stream that can be analyzed simultaneously in both the time and frequency domains; at higher data rates jitter analysis is more challenging. This discussion is from the perspective of a digital engineer, drawing on the experience of synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) where many challenges have already been addressed.",

Capacity-approaching codes such as turbo and LDPC codes, discovered or rediscovered in the past decade, offset near-Shannon-limit performance on the AWGN channel with rather low implementation complexity and are therefore increasingly being applied for error control in various fields of data communications. This article describes a generic multilevel modulation and coding scheme based on the use of turbo-like, or LDPC codes for DSL system. It is shown that such codes provide significant gains in performance and allow an increase in data rate and/or loop reach that can be instrumental to the widespread deployment of future DSL services. Such techniques are also suitable for general multilevel modulation system in other application areas.",

      "abstract": "Internetworking is a complex problem, traditionally tackled by splitting responsibilities between several layers of protocols arranged in a stack. A shortcoming of the current Internet suite's layers is that the responsibilities of individual layers are somewhat ill defined. The result is that frequently a feature may cause problems for higher layers when it unexpectedly exists lower in the stack, or may be unnecessarily and inefficiently implemented in multiple layers. Mobility is one such feature with no well defined place in classical protocol stacks. If a link layer hands over between two distinctly administered networks, a network layer protocol will likely need to acquire a new address. Similarly, if mobility is implemented at the network layer, such as with mobile IP, transport layer protocols must be prepared to deal with a slew of problems (rapid changes in available capacity and delay, the asymmetry of triangle routes, and security policies, to name a few). Code for higher-level protocols (above transport) is less frequently reused, so higher-layer mobility schemes fail to leverage the large base of TCP sockets code. We discuss the various strengths and weaknesses of implementing mobility at three different layers of the protocol stack, concluding that a transport layer mobility scheme is likely to suit today's mobile Internet users best, and that ideally there should be more communication between layers to avoid conflict and inefficiency.",

      "abstract": "A set of novel PHY-MAC mechanisms based on a cross layer dialogue have been proposed, and their performance has been analyzed. System efficiency improvement is achieved by means of automatic transmission rate adaptation, trading off bit rate for power, with resulting energy saving features in a generic packet-switched CDMA access network. The rate adaptation mechanism improves spectrum efficiency while keeping packet delay minimized. On the other hand, power dependent strategies reduce power consumption and intercell interference. Simulation results show that the benefits obtained are very encouraging, so the proposed schemes could be used in future communication systems.",

Many MIMO transmission schemes proposed in the literature are, however, based on idealized assumptions. Several effects that may occur in a practical system, such as intersymbol interference, nonperfect channel knowledge, fast fading, and correlation between the individual transmission paths, significantly influence system performance. On the basis of two particularly simple but nonetheless efficient MIMO transmission schemes, the above effects are illustrated, and possible countermeasures are discussed.",

The recent advances in capacity-approaching codes hold the promise to push the areal density to the ultimate limit. Various configurations regarding the interplay between soft detection and soft decoding through an iterative process, as it applies to the magnetic recording channel, are presented. In particular, the state of the art in turbo and turbo-like coding, including LDPC coding, is reviewed, and the serial concatenation of these coding schemes with inner generalized PR channels in a turbo equalization structure is described. Finally, an attempt is made to assess the performance and limitations of these AWGN channel-capacity-approaching codes when applied to the magnetic recording channel.",

      "abstract": "The article introduces several configurations of class E power amplifiers in CMOS technologies. Each configuration, however, alleviates some problems in the design of class E power amplifiers. The two-stage class E power amplifier reveals the design technique for the driving stage, which provides a more efficient driving signal in terms of class E operation. The complementary configuration takes advantage of the symmetrical circuit topology, which allows much lower total harmonic distortion in the output signal. The power-adaptive technique based on high-Q varactors gives a more feasible and effective approach to achieving the function of output power control for switching-mode power amplifiers. An approach to implement linear power amplification using switching mode power amplifiers is also introduced that can achieve linear amplification while still keeping high power efficiency and output power.",

J., vol.32, p.406-24, 1953) on multistage switch architectures has been huge, his work and ideas still live on. We discuss node architectures for optical packet switching and show how the multistage approach proposed by Clos can be adopted to solve scalability issues and construct switches with large port counts. As in the old days, the driving factors behind the introduction of multistage concepts also include economic issues: compared to a single-stage architecture, the number of components to realize the switching fabric is reduced.",

In considering the role of the user in the wireless world of the future, the Human Perspective Working Group (WG1) of the Wireless World Research Forum has gathered input and developed positions in four important areas: methods, processes, and best practices for user-centered research and design; reference frameworks for modeling user needs within the context of wireless systems; user scenario creation and analysis; and user interaction technologies. This article provides an overview of WG1's work in these areas that are critical to ensuring that the future wireless world meets and exceeds the expectations of people in the coming decades.",

      "abstract": "A new OSI-based model is described that can be used for the classification of residential gateways. It is applied to analyze current gateway solutions and draw evolutionary paths for the medium to long term. From this it is concluded that particularly set-top boxes and broadband modems, as opposed to game consoles and PCs, have a strong potential to evolve toward gateways that deliver network services to the home on all OSI layers, although they probably will not converge. In our model, we have not found any compelling reasons for the residential gateway industry to support concurrent multiple broadband access network connections on a single residential gateway in the near future.",

      "abstract": "Beyond-3G (B3G) systems have been envisaged as an evolution and convergence of mobile/wireless communication systems and IP technologies to offer a multitude of services over a variety of access technologies. To fulfill the vision, it is necessary to understand the requirements with respect to the support of heterogeneity in network accesses, communication services, mobility, user devices, and so on. Besides, it is equally important to promote the necessary research in networking technology by providing a guiding framework of research areas and technical issues with priority. The new architectures and technologies have to address the fundamental assumptions and requirements that govern the design. All these issues are being tackled by the cooperative network group (CoNet) of WWRF; the group is working on a series of white papers outlining B3G visions and roadmap, architectural principles, research challenges, and candidate approaches. This article outlines the CoNet concept, architectural principles, and guidelines for research into cooperative networks assuming that the B3G systems are built over generic IP networking technologies. The article also presents the key research challenges, research framework, and major network components and technologies. The key points are that the system should be layered on demand, encourage reuse if independent modularized functional blocks, support multiple services and service creation, ensure consistent end-to-end connectivity across different access technologies, and cooperate in terms of network control, operations, and maintenance. The architecture includes the endpoints of communications as part of the communications system, and provides a secure and trusted environment in which network functions are performed; the network should self-organize dynamically. Additionally, the article presents the IST WSI architecture proposed to CoNet as reference model along with some approaches to the outlined research challenges. Finally, this study selects three important network components and technologies (i.e., mobility management, multiple access, and moving networks) in order to provide with answers and possible solutions the research challenges presented in earlier sections.",

      "abstract": "MIMO systems are characterized by their maximum available capacity, which is reduced if there is correlation between the signals on different channels. The correlation is primarily caused by mutual coupling between the elements of the antenna arrays on both the receiving and transmitting sides. Similarly, diversity antennas can be characterized by a diversity gain that also is affected by mutual coupling between the antennas. We explain how such MIMO and diversity antennas with mutual coupling can be analyzed by classical embedded element patterns that can be computed by standard computer codes. In the MIMO example under investigation, the mutual coupling reduces both correlation, which increases the capacity, and radiation efficiency, which decreases it, and the combined effect is a net capacity reduction. We also explain how the radiation efficiency, diversity gain, correlation, and channel capacity can be measured in a reverberation chamber. The measurements show good agreement with simulations.",

      "abstract": "A key development of telecommunication systems during the past two decades has been the evolution from the circuit-switched network toward the packet-switched network paradigm. Many operators are now migrating their PSTNs from circuit switched networks. This new approach is often called the next-generation network NGN enables network operators to run all services (i.e., voice, data and video) on one network. In this article the migration of Iceland Telecom's circuit-switched PSTN towards NGN is described. A cost model of the telecommunications system has been developed to enable cost and benefits analysis of transforming the network to NGN. Methods of optimization and their application to determine the optimal number and position of nodes in the future network are described. The optimization produces a network structure with the lowest possible total cost of ownership, and the model can also indicate how deviations from the optimum affect cost. The feasibility of NGN is assessed by comparing the cost of NGN migration to that of maintaining the current circuit-switched network.",

      "abstract": "The use of wireless, DSL, and cable for broadband access has become increasingly prevalent in metropolitan areas. While these technologies are being successfully utilized in terms of both service quality and economics in densely populated areas, there are still vast geographic regions where broadband services are either prohibitively expensive or simply unavailable at any price. The article examines several alternatives for using 2.4 GHz 802.11b (WiFi) technology to provide fixed broadband access in rural areas consisting of towns, smaller remote communities, clusters of subscribers separated by large intercluster distances, as well as widely scattered users. Our approach is to model a network based on realistic demographics, equipment and operations costs, service revenues, and customer demand and usage, and calculate the lifecycle economics in terms of capital investment and profitability. We consider the cost benefits of several emerging technologies and architectures, including high gain antennas, dynamically steerable beamforming antennas, and multihop routing. Our results show that cost-effective affordable high-speed wireless Internet access can be provided in rural and remote areas using nontraditional and innovative approaches, bridging the so-called digital divide.",

Such a system can be used to validate the assumptions and results of various theoretical and simulation-based studies. This article discusses the design and development of a multicarrier multi-antenna software defined radio, operating at 5.25 GHz in a 25 MHz bandwidth. The calibration process is described in detail along with a discussion of all the issues such as I/Q mismatch and phase noise that degrade and limit the performance of the system. Hardware and software solutions to these problems are described. Results of the calibration process and wireless experiments on the system are presented as well.",

Historically, the cost of the 60 GHz electronics, implemented in the compound semiconductor technology, has been prohibitively expensive. A fully integrated CMOS solution has the potential to drastically reduce costs enough to hit consumer price points.

This article outlines the system architecture and circuit design considerations that influence the development of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags through a case study involving a high-performance implementation that achieves a throughput of nearly 800 tags/s at a range greater than 10 m. The impact of a novel circuit design approach ideally suited to the power and die area challenges is also discussed. Insights gleaned from first-generation efforts are reviewed as an object lesson in how to make RFID technology for SCM, at a cost measured in pennies per tag, reach its full potential through a generation 2 standard.",

      "abstract": "Optical networks based on WDM technology have become a promising solution to realize transport networks that can meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth. As WDM networks carry a huge volume of traffic, maintaining a high level of survivability is an important and critical issue. The. development of GMPLS switching technology led to the direct integration of IP and WDM. In these IP-over-WDM networks different applications/end users need different levels of fault tolerance and differ in how much they are willing to pay for the service they get. The current trend in network development is moving toward a unified solution providing support for voice, data, and various multimedia services. Therefore, it imperative that WDM networks incorporate fault tolerance to single or multiple component failures, protection bandwidth, recovery time, and recovery granularity besides resource utilization and call acceptance ratio. This article presents a survey of various methods that have been proposed for providing service differentiation in survivable WDM networks and discuss their performance. Such methods are broadly classified under various paradigms such as differentiated reliability, R-connections, quality of protection, and quality of recovery.",

This article aims to investigate and review the possibilities for the dynamic allocation of spectrum to different radio networks operating in a composite reconfigurable wireless system. The article first looks into the current interest of regulators in this area, before describing some possible schemes to implement dynamic spectrum allocation and showing some example performance results. Following this, the technical requirements that a DSA system would have, in terms of reconfigurable system implementation, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The use of multiple antennas has found various applications in the area of wireless communications. One such application has recently become very popular and is referred to as the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system. The main idea behind MIMO is to establish independent parallel channels between multiple transmit and receive antennas. Each channel uses the same frequency, and the transmissions occur simultaneously. In such a configuration, the amount of data transmitted increases linearly with the number of parallel channels, which is what makes MIMO so popular in the wireless world. The enormous capacity offered by MIMO systems is not realizable when the parallel channels are highly correlated. The goal of this article is to highlight the correlation concept and its impact on MIMO systems. Although correlation can be defined in many dimensions, here we focus on spatial correlation, and specifically consider antenna correlations in mobile units. We provide an overview of spatial correlation and present its underlying parameters in detail. Special attention is given to mutual coupling since it has signal decorrelation and antenna gain reduction effects. We then present how correlation in a MIMO system affects the amount of data that can be transmitted (MIMO capacity) and briefly review how power should be distributed with the knowledge of correlation. Analyses indicate that in real propagation environments, the high capacity gain of MIMO systems can be realized with improved antenna selection algorithms and power allocation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The standardization of passive optical networks capable of transporting Ethernet frames at gigabit-per-second speeds, currently in progress in both ITU-T and IEEE, constitutes a major milestone toward cost-effective photonization of the last (aka first) mile. The article presents an Ethernet gigabit PON (GPON) system aligned with the philosophy of the evolving FSAN (full service access network) ITU-T specification, which focuses on the efficient support of any level of quality of service. The intelligence of this system, in terms of traffic quality guarantees, lies in the MAC protocol, which controls the distributed multiplexing/concentration function by allocating variable length slots to every user of the shared upstream (toward the network) medium. The way transport of information is organized in an ITU-T GPON system and the operation of a MAC protocol that preserves all QoS guarantees are presented and evaluated.",

Reaching this goal requires efficient cooperation between heterogeneous networking technologies and different protocols. Wireless personal networks are an integral part of such an emerging heterogeneous infrastructure. It is highly desirable, and in fact required due to economical constraints, to incorporate the present wireless systems in building the new paradigm. The key \"protocol glue\" between systems is the use of IP. Based on this scenario, we describe an architecture suited for the present and future personal mobile communications networks and services.",

      "abstract": "The emerging next-generation networking environment presents an IP-based core interconnecting many wireless radio access networks, providing ubiquitous access to end users through a vast variety of wireless devices. Although the IP protocol is the common denominator, the new environment brings together many different interconnecting domains, each following different QoS models, complicating the overall end-to-end QoS process. This article discusses the need to standardize an end-to-end QoS protocol. It does not, however, focus on the signaling mechanism, since there is currently a relevant ongoing activity in IETF. Instead, it concentrates on the formulation of the QoS information describing the QoS requirements of the session to be established. It presents the generic service specification framework that not only enables the QoS requirements of a specific session to be captured (like a generic QoS template), but also the QoS classes of each IP domain can be described according to it. Through the systematic specification of a domain's QoS classes, an intelligent automatic mapping algorithm can be applied during an end-to-end QoS request, in order to select the most appropriate service class in each domain, as well as to extract the required traffic-related parameters to perform traffic control operations, such as admission control, policing, and scheduling.",

      "abstract": "Enterprises and residential customers increasingly take advantage of more sophisticated applications and evolve their business models. At the same time service providers face declining revenues from existing connectivity services. SPs respond to these trends and start to offer highly customized, high-bandwidth network services that complement and interwork with their existing leased line, ATM, or frame relay offerings. Ethernet is quickly becoming the customer UNI of choice. Ethernet, being a packet-based technology, complements IP-based services such as content, voice, data, video, and additional value-added services over a high-speed access connection. Ethernet also provides a flexible high-speed connection to the SP network and eliminates access bottlenecks. Using Ethernet as the common access interface, providers can employ flexible transport services that enable additional value-added services at layer 3 and above. At the same time the rollout of Ethernet services also challenges the installed base, given that bandwidth per customer is usually much higher and additional attributes for tight SLAs apply. This calls for an updated approach to network deployment and rollout: networks need to be planned and built in a service-centric fashion. Starting with a brief look at the driving forces for Ethernet-based public communication services, this article identifies five generic services for Ethernet MANs/WANs and discusses related deployment issues of the different service options, such as the degree of customization, geographic reach and bandwidth profile of the service, as well as evolution aspects of the installed base.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communications is witnessing the emergence of the composite radio and reconfigurability concepts. The former assumes that different radio networks can be cooperating components in a heterogeneous wireless access infrastructure, through which network providers can more efficiently achieve the required capacity and QoS levels. Reconfigurability enables terminals and network elements to dynamically select and adapt to the most appropriate radio access technologies for handling conditions encountered in specific service area regions and time zones of the day. Both concepts pose new requirements on the management of wireless systems. This article presents a management system, which has been developed for enabling wireless systems to operate in a CR context. Moreover, the article addresses the necessary extensions to the management system for handling the impact of the reconfigurability context.",

This development, coupled with the maturing of the XML standards and widespread support of XML libraries, utilities, and applications, is catalyzing changes in the design of data networking products and the software systems created to manage them. These changes are driven by the promised benefits of faster product development, tighter system integration and more robust device management. In this article, we describe our experiences in exploring and designing network management solutions for products ranging from small resource-limited data networking to high-capacity server-hosted control plane monitoring systems. We describe the motivations and explorations that led to the approach we finally adopted, and summarize what we have learned in the process.",

A number of scenarios are analyzed from a practical perspective, considering important aspects relevant to the management and control planes. Along the lines of three basic dimensions, to which we refer as locality, granularity, and ownership, we discuss the complexity associated with provisioning and restoring end-to-end optical services in regional (local scale) and national (global scale) networking scenarios. We identify a number of challenges in integrating a unified control plane solution and vendor-specific management and control planes with legacy carrier management systems.",

This is especially true of devices that maintain direct hardware connections between each other in support of the high-speed low-latency communications required by many waveforms. This article illustrates the application of the SCA core framework for these types of modem architectures, including aggregating devices in support of direct hardware interconnects between components and the incorporation of a switched fabric communications infrastructure within the overall modem architecture.",

      "abstract": "This article is a progress report on the use of optical fiber as a successor to copper twisted pair of coax for \"last mile\" broadband access. We point out that the pressures for more per-user bandwidth are growing; that effective architectures have been designed, standardized, and placed in service; that fiber economies have become at least competitive with copper; and that promising early deployments have succeeded, particularly outside North America. As for North America, which lags the rest of the world in per-capita fiber access deployment, we note that there is already a modest \"first wave\" of deployments, but the full promise of fiber to the premises awaits a change of heart by the major carriers, probably driven by loss of copper-based broadband customers to the cable companies, user bandwidth growth (including HDTV), and issues of international competitiveness.",

In particular, we provide detailed discussions on an architecture design for a high capacity optical label switching router by considering enabling optical technologies. In pursuit of an effective contention resolution scheme, we investigate an end-to-end solution by incorporating a traffic shaping function at the network edge with wavelength, time, and space dimensions contention resolution in the core network. Experimental results indicate that this scheme is capable of achieving very low packet loss rates. Furthermore, due to its natural compatibility with GMPLS architecture, optical label switching has great potential for a seamless upgrade of today's optical networks toward the next generation Internet.",

The treatment is an exploration of some technologies; due to the requirement to cover the topic from a broad perspective, it is not possible to go into technical details. We review current developments toward future mobile broadband networks, and then present the 4G paradigm of trying to combine heterogeneous networks, both cellular wireless hotspots and sensor networks, together with Internet protocols. We show how different networks play their own roles in the emerging infrastructure so that we can hop by hop wave the broadband network from mobile devices toward the fiber optic core network.",

Mobility is supported through both cellular-specific and IP mechanisms. Mobile IP is becoming a key technology for managing mobility wireless networks. At the same time, the session initiation protocol is the key to realizing and provisioning services in IP-based cellular networks. The need for mobility of future real-time service independent of terminal mobility requires SIP to seamlessly interwork with mobile IP operations.

      "abstract": "Although anycast communication supports service-oriented addresses, many of its current definitions in IPv6 are unclear. Furthermore, since there are no protocol standards or even a consensus on controlling routing, intersegment anycast communications are not yet available. In this article we first review IPv6-based anycast communication. At present, there are several possible applications that are suited to this. We then raise several problems and provide possible solutions to these. Based on this background, we present the Anycast Address Resolving Protocol (AARP) to establish TCP connections with a specific anycast address, and then propose a routing protocol for intersegment anycasts. Our proposed architecture makes anycast addresses.more useful without (or with at most minimal) need for modifications/extensions to existing applications and/or upper-layer protocols.",

The transmitter of the testbed consists of three signal generators transmitting three independent OFDM signals at 25 Msamples/s synchronously. Three synchronized receiving links are used, each of which includes an RF receiver, an analog-to-digital converter, a digital downconverter, and a PowerPC processor for baseband processing. The performance and complexity of three typical BLAST detection techniques (linear detection, ordered decision feedback detection, and partial decision detection) are evaluated and compared using the data from the experiments conducted in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight indoor environments.",

      "abstract": "Aiming to introduce voice over IP networks and services in ways that satisfy the voice quality expectations of our customers, we have been conducting laboratory studies of how VoIP transmission affects voice quality while also carefully monitoring and managing several field implementations of VoIP. This article summarizes much of what we have learned in this work, and we hope it provides a useful progress report on the industry's evolution to VoIP. We review our data on the voice quality effects of packet loss, delay, speech coders, packet loss concealment algorithms, and the compression option of suppressing transmission during silence. Because the familiar problem of echo has emerged repeatedly in the VoIP environment, we review this issue in some detail. Packet loss and delay variation measurements made on private VoIP networks are reviewed, and the data here are encouraging. We finish by making our case that the network planning tool known as the E-model is currently an inexact predictor of VoIP network performance.",

      "abstract": "Observation and management of quality of service in cellular networks is a very important function. This article shows that it should be performed not only at the network level, as is done today, but also individually in each and every user terminal. Existing centralized network QoS systems only collect data, which allows evaluation of average QoS at the network or cell levels. However, they do not provide any objective data for estimating the QoS actually served to individual mobile users. This article offers a concept of individual QoS rating, which would allow dynamic assessment, recording, and subsequent analysis of the actual QoS received by a particular mobile user (individual QoS). Individual QoS ratings so obtained could then be reported to the user directly (as part of the intelligent user terminal concept) and otherwise become a part of service-level transactions (billing, etc.) between the user and the network operator. Realization of this novel value-added service can be achieved by integrating a special QoS module (software agent) into user terminals for monitoring and recording of individual QoS data.",

EoS leverages the existing SONET/SDH infrastructure to provide efficient Ethernet transport with excellent OAM capabilities. In our initial evaluations and deployments of EoS, we have encountered some issues, as is common with any new technology. These issues include non-transparent transport of Ethernet information, lack of carrier-class performance monitoring and fault propagation, and non-standardized implementation of basic concepts. Vendors, service providers, and standards bodies should work together to resolve these remaining issues and thus bring forth the full potential of EoS.",

These systems have unique characteristics and face many implementation challenges. Among all, the requirement of long operating life for a wireless sensor node under limited energy supply imposes the most severe design constraints. This calls for innovative design methodologies to address this rigorous requirement. This article first provides an overview of wireless technologies for sensor networks. It then describes communication system, circuit design, and system packaging considerations. The selection of radio architectures and circuit techniques is discussed with an emphasis on the low-power implementation and operating characteristics that match requirements of sensor network application. Finally, the design, implementation, and performance of the most challenging component, a complete low-power CMOS receiver system, is presented to demonstrate these design principles.",

However, it has to be taken into account that there is a broad existing management infrastructure based on non-XML protocols. Today, the most dominant technology in Internet management is based on the SNMP framework. This article presents an approach for seamless integration of management information supplied by SNMP agents into XML-based systems. This is done by an automated transformation of SMI MIB definitions into XML schema definitions, which implies a corresponding transformation of SNMP management information into XML documents. Furthermore, we present an SNMP-to-XML gateway that allows retrieval of such XML management information at runtime.",

Since the selection of an antenna configuration paired with realizable uplink/downlink algorithms that can satisfy all operating environments is a broad task, this article focus is on cost-effective antenna arrays for macrocells. Algorithms that exploit the antenna configurations and act at both the physical and MAC layers are highlighted and supported by simulation results. Two solutions stand out for UMTS: a universal beamforming algorithm that unifies user-specific and fixed beamforming under one framework, and multibeam scheduling (MBS) that significantly increases downlink packet data throughput using the concept of code reuse in conjunction with beamforming. The article summarizes the critical issues that were faced in the development of an IA solution capable of delivering the theoretically promised benefits to end users.",

As government networks providing services to the global information grid (GIG) migrate toward an IPv6-based infrastructure, the implications of an expanded packet header must be analyzed. This article describes two IPv6 applicable header compression schemes developed by the IETF, and how networks across the GIG infrastructure can adopt them in an effort to reduce IPv6 expanded overhead requirements.",

      "abstract": "Currently, LAN technology is predominantly Ethernet-based and offers packet-optimized switched technology. With more than 90 percent of Internet traffic originating from Ethernet-based LANs, efforts are underway to extend Ethernet beyond LANs into MANs and further into WANs. However, native Ethernet protocols need extensions or support from other technologies in order to succeed as MAN technology in terms of scalability, QoS, resiliency, OAM, and so on. The two emerging trends to carry Ethernet traffic across the MAN can be classified into native Ethernet (IEEE) protocol extensions, and encapsulation by another transportation technology such as MPLS networks. The goal is to offer new and challenging services such as virtual private LAN service, also known as transparent LAN service (TLS). This article presents a comprehensive overview of the required extensions/support of the Ethernet with an emphasis on the emerging provider bridge technology.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years, multiprotocol label switching has been successfully, deployed by the majority of service providers worldwide. The label distribution protocol is used in many MPLS networks for distributing labels to establish the label switched paths. This article focuses on LDP failures, namely failures that may occur in LDP while the underlining interior gateway protocol of choice, and the physical connections are operating normally. Since LDP and MPLS in general do not have intrinsic means for detecting these failures, new mechanisms have to be introduced to handle them. Furthermore, the IGP may remain unaware of the LDP failure, and continue to direct traffic to the faulty path. To resolve this situation, coupling between LDP and the routing protocol may have to be introduced. In this article, we discuss all aspects related to handling LDP failures: discovery, location, notification, recovery, and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly intelligent Internet overlay networks promise to deliver streaming media and value-added media services in ways that cannot be achieved easily with conventional broadcast networks. Such an overlay would allow an individual viewer or groups of viewers to receive unique programming content (e.g., commercial advertisements, entertainment) that matches their previously specified preferences. Toward this end, we introduce a scalable overlay network architecture and signaling mechanism that permits dynamic program insertions in live high-quality video streams transmitted over IP networks. We describe the implementation of an application proxy that dynamically inserts prerecorded video programs into NTSC Dl quality motion-JPEG streams with no visible artifacts. We argue that on-demand program switching is merely a first step toward a new generation of media services; increases in computing power ultimately permits network-based proxies to manipulate and augment multimedia content as it flows through the network.",

Layer 2 and 3 VPN services are currently being designed and deployed, even as the related standards are being developed.

Some specific L2VPN and L3VPN technologies described here include virtual private LAN service, transparent LAN service, BGP/MPLS-based VPNs (RFC 2547bis), virtual router, and IPSec VPN approaches. We discuss recent and continuing standards efforts in the IETF 12vpn and 13vpn working groups, and related work in the pseudo-wire emulation edge-to-edge working group, as well as in some other standards fora, and describe some mechanisms that provide membership, reachability, topology, security, and management functions.",

The support of layer-encoded video streaming with the aid of proxies enables a video distribution infrastructure that is efficient in today's Internet, and allows new mechanisms and techniques to be leveraged in a future Internet. An overview of a scalable and adaptive streaming architecture is presented. Open problems in the distribution and caching process are identified. Throughout the article solutions to improve the performance of such a video distribution architecture are discussed, mainly from the perspective of a proxy cache. The investigations that led to these solutions are based on an empirical experiment with layer encoded video. The goal of this experiment was to understand the effect of varying the number of layers on the viewer's perceived quality. The results of this initial investigation can be seen as the foundation for subsequent studies on mechanisms that improve the transport and caching of layer-encoded video in a scalable adaptive streaming architecture.",

      "abstract": "User-controlled optical networks play a key role in supporting electronic transfer of the enormous volumes of data generated in emerging e-science experiments. The ability of users to manage their own resources enables provisioning of bandwidth-guaranteed tunnels on demand without the costs associated with conventional managed services offered by network providers. However, building high-performance user-controlled networks has only become feasible in the last few years, as trends in the telecommunications industry have made it possible for users to purchase installed optical fiber and light it using their own premises equipment. Consequently, suitable network management technologies have not yet evolved. In particular, there is presently no means for users to easily provision bandwidth-guaranteed tunnels across multiple independent management domains. In this article we present a user-controlled lightpath management system that addresses this problem. We begin by reviewing the high-level functionality of the system. Then we examine the software architecture. Finally, we discuss design challenges faced while building the system and propose future extensions.",

      "abstract": "The current generation of network carriers competes intensely to satisfy the diverse wide-area connectivity requirements of customers. At the same time, the carriers inherently wish to maximize the usage efficiency of their network infrastructure. Much of the research in network resource management has been devoted to providing bandwidth guarantees and preventing network congestion. However, the rapid growth in number and diversity of real-time network applications has made it imperative to consider the impact of end-to-end delay of traffic requirements on network resource provisioning. We present an efficient network resource provisioning algorithm, called link criticality based routing (LCBR), which relies on the guiding theme that load balancing leads to higher resource utilization efficiency. LCBR applies a simple but very effective notion of link criticality to achieve networkwide load balance while simultaneously meeting the QoS requirements of bandwidth and end-to-end delay. In addition, LCBR can simultaneously provision both primary and backup routes to support fast recovery from node or link failures. This article reviews the state of the art in network resource provisioning with QoS guarantees, introduces the LCBR algorithm, and identifies future research challenges.",

      "abstract": "Bluetooth enables wireless communication via ad hoc networks. The basic topology (piconet) is a collection of slaves controlled by a master. A scatternet is a multihop network of piconets. We anticipate that most scatternets will be composed of only a few piconets. However, even in small scatternets, efficient data flow requires the design of inter-piconet scheduling algorithms. Thus, this article presents and evaluates a load adaptive scheduling algorithm tailored for small-scale scatternets. The main advantage of this algorithm is the use of the Bluetooth low-power hold mode, which allows greater flexibility than other low-power modes. A simulation model has been developed in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. We show that the results obtained by the model are very close to the analytic results. Then we evaluate the performance of various intra-piconet scheduling algorithms. Finally, we present simulation results regarding inter-piconet scheduling, and compare the proposed algorithm to algorithms using the sniff mode.",

      "abstract": "Flexible multimedia streaming, such as advertisement insertion, location-based services, mobility, and wireless access, are vital components that make existing Internet radio and TV networks more attractive to roaming users. All of these applications also provide added value to telematics and military usage, including coordination, education, situation awareness, distributed simulation, battlefield communication, and multiplayer games. While content distribution over a wired network can be realized by instituting proxies and gateways at several parts of the access network, to provide mobility over heterogeneous wireless access, we need to consider many operational issues, such as handoff, join and leave latency, and desired QoS level for mobile clients. The article discusses some application layer techniques that help build a flexible mobile content distribution overlay type network supporting a multi-tiered payment and security scheme. The proposed streaming network, called MarconiNet, is based on standard IETF protocols (e.g., SIP, SAP, SDP, RTSP, and RTP/RTCP) that help provide signaling, session announcement, session description, stream control, media delivery, and feedback control, respectively.",

In this article the protocol profiles are tested across a \"worst case\" tactical HF link providing IP services. There are considerable throughput gains available using the tactical profile. Among the various automated HF technologies tested, the new HDL+ data link protocol, suggested for standardization within NATO, shows the best throughput capabilities for short to medium-size messages on typical HF channels. 3G HF is the most robust technology at low signal-to-noise ratios. The 2G HF throughput performance suffers from inefficient linking procedures. There are optimization issues at different levels of the protocol stack, and implementation choices have great impact on overall performance.",

Since a variety of performance measures are important in wireless communications, a family of testbeds becomes essential to validate the gains reported by the theory. Wireless testbeds also play a very important role in academia for training students and enabling research. In this article we discuss a classification scheme for wireless testbeds and present an example of the testbeds developed at UCLA for each of these cases. We present the unique capabilities of these testbeds, provide the results of the experiments, and discuss the role they play in an educational environment.",

      "abstract": "Many new Internet applications require data transmission from a sender to multiple receivers. Unfortunately, the IP multicast technology used today suffers from scalability problems, especially when used fro small and sparse groups. Multicast for small conferences (MSC) is a novel approach aimed at providing more efficient support for audio conferences, for example. It makes use of an IPv6 routing header. The unicast addresses of a small receiver group are put into the extension header in order to be forwarded to all group members. The results indicate that MSC has the potential to replace IP multicast for many delay-sensitive small group applications, even with very limited support from the network infrastructure.",

This article focuses on the antenna aspect of MIMO systems. In particular, we emphasize the important role of the reconfigurable antenna and its links with space-time coding techniques that can be employed for further exploitation of the theoretical performance of MIMO wireless systems. The advantages of the reconfigurable antenna compared to the traditional smart antenna are discussed. Establishment of reconfigurable antennas requires novel radio frequency microelectromechanical systems technology, which has recently been developed in the authors' group. We briefly introduce this technology with emphasis on its distinct advantages over existing silicon-based MEMS technologies for reconfigurable antennas. A reconfigurable antenna design that can change its operating frequency and radiation/polarization characteristics is described. Finally, we present the experimental and theoretical results from impedance and radiation performance characterization for different antenna configurations.",

      "abstract": "New York City transit's subway system is one of the largest and most complex mass transportation systems in the world. Because of the extensive subway system, an extensive communications network infrastructure is needed to allow for communications of the various subway services with the control centers to support mission-critical (and safety-critical) applications. The current network utilizes multilayer network technologies, including SONET, ATM, and IP (layer 2/3 device) layer networks. As a consequence of using these various technologies, extensive challenges are faced in trying to consolidate these separate networks into a single management view, simplifying (and automating) not only the provisioning aspects but also troubleshooting/fault management aspects of the network. Such automation will help to simplify network operations and allow for better handling and management of the reliability and availability of the network. To achieve this goal, various technologies were evaluated. Consideration is being given to multiprotocol label switching technology. MPLS offers the potential to help converge to a simpler networking model. In order to achieve this, certain capabilities must be available (e.g., the ability to quickly and automatically identify defects/failures and subsequently reroute around these failures). This article discusses the operational requirements for the MPLS network from the point of view of backbone networks that support a mass transportation system operator.",

      "abstract": "The integration of various network-level functions, including routing, management, and security, is critical to the efficient operation of a mobile ad hoc network. In this article we focus on network mobility (rather than node mobility), implying the movement of entire subnetworks with respect to one another, while individual users initially associated with one such subnetwork may also move to other domains. One example is a battlefield network that includes ships, aircraft, and ground troops. In this \"network of networks\", subnets (e.g. shipboard networks) may be interconnected via a terrestrial mobile wireless network (e.g., between moving ships). We discuss the design and implementation of a new ad hoc routing protocol, a suite of solutions for policy-based network management, and approaches for key management and deployment of IPsec in a MANET. These solutions, in turn, are integrated with real-time middleware, a secure radio link, and a topology monitoring tool. We briefly describe each component of the solution, and focus on the challenges and approaches to integrating these components into a cohesive system to support network mobility. We evaluate the effectiveness of the system through experiments conducted in a wireless ad hoc testbed.",

      "abstract": "This article describes OAM in MPLS layer 2 transport networks. MPLS networks used to transport layer 2 traffic are referred to as MPLS layer 2 transport networks. They may be used to connect legacy layer 2 networks and/or provide layer 2 service to a user over a MPLS network. As legacy layer 2 networks migrate to use MPLS for transport, the role of MPLS OAM mechanisms is becoming increasingly important. This is because the converged network must offer the same OAM functionality as existing layer 2 networks. This article emphasizes the importance of end-to-end OAM, while emulating existing layer 2 services using MPLS transport. End-to-end fault detection is described in the context of various layer 2 over MPLS transport network models. The article focuses on state-of-the-art MPLS label switched path and pseudo wire OAM mechanisms being developed by the IETF. This includes fault detection and isolation mechanisms such as LSP-Ping, bidirectional forwarding detection, and virtual circuit connectivity verification. The applicability of each of these mechanisms is given. In some cases it may be possible to carry layer 2 OAM cells end-to-end, while in other cases this may not be possible. The relationship between segment-based OAM mechanisms and end-to-end OAM is described for each of these cases.",

      "abstract": "From the early days of management research and standardization in the late 1980's, there has always been a quest for a management technology that would be general enough to be used for network, system, service, and distributed application management; efficient in terms of information retrieval time, computational resources required, and management traffic incurred; and easy to use in order to reduce development time and operational costs. From protocol-based approaches such as OSI management and SNMP, attention shifted to distributed object and Web-based approaches. Recently, XML-based approaches and, in particular, Web services have been emerging as a promising Internet-based technology that might also be used for management. In this article we survey first the key aspects of protocol and distributed object approaches to management. We subsequently examine Web services as a distributed object approach to management, and consider its suitability, usability, and performance in comparison to SNMP and CORBA.",

      "abstract": "While great strides have been made in the design and deployment of commercial networks over the past two decades, relatively little progress has been made toward the realization of large-scale tactical military networks. The primary reasons for this disparity include the fact that commercial telecommunication networks are predominantly wired, relatively stable infrastructures, whereas tactical networks consist largely of wireless mobile nodes with unique operating characteristics in hostile environments. Wireless networks must cope with dynamic link conditions not present in wired infrastructures, which place a heavy burden on quality of service management solutions. Managing QoS in the face of constantly changing operating conditions demands dynamic management approaches that span multiple layers in the protocol stack. Such cross-layer design approaches have recently received attention in the context of cellular and mobile ad hoc networks. However, there are still a wide range of opinions and definitions about what exactly CLD entails, and there is no fundamental guidance concerning how to apply CLD techniques in various environments. In this article we introduce the notion of network predictability and describe its relationship to achievable QoS. This relationship is used to propose a framework for CLD that can be used to guide development efforts and direct investment decisions for future military networks. The framework also contains the notion of a crosslayer coherence length, which determines the protocol layers across which the highest degree of coupling, or correlation, should be present in order to realize the greatest possible gains in achievable QoS.",

This article presents an overview of various features of BWA systems toward realizing a high level of scalability to support a potentially fast expanding network. This is achieved by optimizing various network resources, which include utilizing the available bandwidth efficiency, making a minor enhancement to an existing system that minimizes the disruption to network services during the network expansion process, and combining the benefits of different features to increase network capacity.",

      "abstract": "The boundaries between packet and circuit networks have long disappeared, with many traditional circuit-switched applications such as voice and video now being carried over packet-switched IP/MPLS or Ethernet networks. However, this transition has happened so fast that many OAM functions supported by circuit-switched networks such as SONET/SDH are still unmatched in packet networks. In order to match the quality sustained by circuit-switched networks, OAM functions must also be developed for such packet networks. A number of recent efforts have started to address OAM functions for IP/MPLS and Ethernet packet technologies. Service providers and carriers alike are the driving force behind the work, as there is general recognition that to generate sustained revenues, services must be efficiently managed. In this article we discuss issues in providing OAM features and capabilities for MPLS-based packet networks.",

To prevent this, PNNI extensions have been adopted in the ATM forum to avoid going into congestion and to recover when congestion occurs. This article presents the adopted mechanisms to enable the PNNI routing protocol to avoid congestion states wherever possible, to respond gracefully to network overloads and failures, and to recover from massive loss of topology database information. The mechanisms include detecting congestion and notifying peers, reducing the rate of topology update control messages, maintaining link adjacencies with prioritized treatment of critical control messages, database backup, graceful recovery of lost topology database information, and database resynchronization. Simulation analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of these routing congestion control mechanisms.",

However, the tremendous growth in access to frame relay, ATM, IP, and Ethernet services, coupled with the desire of enterprise customers to interconnect via Ethernet interfaces, suggests the need for a new approach. This article proposes a new architecture for packet-aware transport networks (PATN) that supports both packet and traditional TDM services and leverages an assemblage of emerging technologies to provide efficient aggregation and switching of packet traffic in metro networks. The PATN has the potential to provide significant cost savings to carriers by reducing the number of network elements, reducing transport costs through statistical multiplexing, and eliminating the need for redundant multiplexing operations.",

      "abstract": "Media streaming over best effort packet networks such as the Internet is quite challenging because of the dynamic and unpredictable available bandwidth, loss rate, and delay. Recently, streaming over multiple paths to provide path diversity has emerged as an approach to help overcome these problems. This article provides an overview of the benefits and use of path diversity for media streaming. The different approaches to media coding and streaming over multiple paths are examined, together with architectures for achieving path diversity between single or multiple senders and a single receiver. Important examples include using the distributed servers in a content delivery network to provide path diversity to a requesting client, using multiple 802.11 wireless access points to provide path diversity to a mobile client, and using relays to provide low-latency media communication. The design, analysis, and operation of media streaming systems that use path diversity are considered, with emphasis on the accurate performance models needed to select the best paths or best servers.",

Recently proposed enhancements to common routing protocols are promising to overcome such shortcomings by providing the means to distribute link state information that is more pertinent to traffic engineering in routed networks. This article presents several key results on the performance of the recently proposed OSPF-TE, with particular emphasis on OSPF-TE protocol traffic overhead and the impact of new link state advertisement triggering mechanisms on traffic-engineered routing accuracy.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews wireless enabling technologies to support interworking of heterogeneous networks, and covers two relevant topics; personal area networks and multistandard terminals. The variability of the PAN channel is demonstrated, and the implications for air interface design are discussed. To ensure the effective operation in the shared spectrum, radio resource management and medium access control strategies for PANs are also discussed. It is recognized that the terminal cost has significant implications for user acceptance; therefore, by combining the functionality from different standards (cellular, wireless LAN, broadcast), the cost can be reduced. Technologies and architectures relevant for multistandard terminals are reviewed, including synchronization and linear RF processing. Finally, the potential for further simplifications within the framework of multicarrier CDMA is considered.",

Implementing a phased array system at high frequency in a commercial silicon process technology presents several challenges. This article focuses on the architectural and circuit-level trade-offs involved in the design of the first silicon-based fully integrated phased array system operating at 24 GHz. The details of some of the important circuit building blocks are also discussed. The measured results demonstrate the feasibility of using integrated phased arrays for wireless communication and vehicular radar applications at 24 GHz.",

      "abstract": "Quality of service in streaming of continuous media over the Internet is poor, which is partly due to variations in delays, bandwidth limitations, and packet losses. Although continuous media applications can tolerate some missing data, non-recoverable information loss degrades these applications' QoS. Consequently, a number of application areas (e.g., those related to the entertainment industry) have backed away from streaming of their content over the Internet. Inability to control the resulting visual and auditory quality of the resulting streamed presentation is an important reason for such a trend. We believe that this trend can be reversed. To this end, our work focuses on providing high-quality streaming through the exploitation of multiple paths existing in the network. By high quality, we mean with significant bandwidth requirements, of relatively long duration, and without information loss or hiccups in data delivery. In this article we present evidence that multi-path streaming is a promising approach.",

      "abstract": "A key feature of optical networks based on WDM technology is the ability to optimize the configuration of optimal resources (i.e., wavelengths) with respect to a particular traffic demand. In the broadcast architecture, this involves the assignment of wavelengths to logical links, while in the optically switched architecture it additionally involves the routing of all-optical data paths known as lightpaths. This survey article is concerned with the problem of automatically updating the configuration of an optical network to accommodate changes in traffic demand, which entails making a reconfiguration policy decision, selecting a new configuration and migrating from the current to the new configuration. Existing solutions are classified according to their algorithmic properties, and compared on the basis performance, computational cost, and flexibility. Finally, open problems and research directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In this article we discuss QoS from a somewhat unconventional point of view. First of all, we argue that high availability is a key ingredient in the QoS perceived by the user. High availability with extremely short interruptions in case of failure is needed for acceptable QoS in real-time dialog services such as telephony or video conferencing. Second, an even distribution of the traffic load over the network is essential to ensure efficient network utilization given that some kind of admission control for QoS traffic has to be in place for overload avoidance. Unfortunately, both these features are not adequately provided in current IP networks. We therefore introduce a new routing scheme offering a massive improvement in availability as well as efficient traffic distribution, while causing only minor computational effort. Our proposals are then evaluated for a high-speed core network. We claim that our proposed approach would be a useful basis for QoS services in an NGN.",

Like conventional Web objects (e.g., HTML pages and images), media objects can benefit from proxy caching; but their unique features such as huge size and high bandwidth demand imply that conventional proxy caching strategies have to be substantially revised. This article discusses the critical issues and challenges of cache management for proxy-assisted media streaming. We survey, classify, and compare the state-of-the-art solutions. We also investigate advanced issues of combining multicast with caching, cooperating among proxies, and leveraging proxy caching in overlay networks.",

      "abstract": "A definition and measurement of quality of service for networked virtual environments (NVEs) presents many challenges, in part due to subjective and qualitative description of users' preferences for NVE-based applications. QoS can be provided, in general, as a per-application service, a network layer option, or both. Many of the proposed QoS architectures for NVE-based applications include the per-application service approach. Most of them focus on video and audio components with less emphasis on user interactions and user-level QoS. A review of architectures and approaches to QoS for NVEs identifies related issues. Those issues include user-level QoS and mapping between user and application-level QoS, as well as the relationship between application-level QoS and network-level requirements. An approach is described that, for a given user-level QoS value, provides a reductions in network requirements by optimizing task or application-level scenarios. An example based on the DIVE testbed illustrates the approach.",

      "abstract": "We present a novel end-to-end QoS architecture that enables seamless services over heterogeneous wireless access networks. We discuss the main architectural approaches and design issues of mobility-aware QoS signaling in IP networks. Then we introduce a QoS signaling architecture that integrates resource management with mobility management. It is based on a domain resource manager concept and nicely supports various handover types in an integrated approach. In particular, we support anticipated handover with pre-reservation of resources over the old network before the mobile node is attached to the new access point.",

      "abstract": "Some chief information officers and information technology managers are reluctant to deploy wireless LANs. Among their concerns are reliability, availability, performance, and deployment. Each of these concerns can be directly addressed through the radio resource management techniques used in a new generation of wireless LAN equipment. The new capabilities include dynamic channel assignment, dynamic power control, and load sharing. Changing from the relatively static radio resource management techniques generally in use today to dynamic methods like those highlighted in this article helps to increase the capacity and improve the performance of large-scale wireless LANs.",

The increased amount of software installed in wireless devices includes both application software and operational software, such as radio software used to implement software-defined radio capabilities.

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in multihop-augmented infrastructure-based networks in both the industry and academia, such as the seed concept in 3GPP, mesh networks in IEEE 802.16, and converge extension of HiperLAN/2 through relays or user-cooperative diversity mesh networks. This article, a synopsis of numerous contributions to the working group 4 of the wireless world research forum and other research work, presents an overview of important topics and applications in the context of relaying. It covers different approaches to exploiting the benefits of multihop communications via relays, such as solutions for radio range extension in mobile and wireless broadband cellular networks (trading range for capacity), and solutions to combat shadowing at high radio frequencies. Furthermore, relaying is presented as a means to reduce infrastructure deployment costs. It is also shown that through the exploitation of spatial diversity, multihop relaying can enhance capacity in cellular networks. We wish to emphasize that while this article focuses on fixed relays, many of the concepts presented can also be applied to systems with moving relays.",

      "abstract": "The recent advent of converging the IP and optical networks has necessitated the development of a generalized multiprotocol label switching framework. Resilience becomes more important than ever before in a GMPLS network since a single cut of an optical fiber may generate hundreds of link and node failures at high layers of the GMPLS architecture. In this article we briefly survey the current work regarding GMPLS recovery management, and present a new resilience-based dynamic GMPLS path management strategy. We present a simple model to represent the resilience requirements in GMPLS path management, and propose fast path management algorithms. The salient feature of the proposed approach is that it enables the paths to be dynamically selected under multiple simultaneous failure occurrences while satisfying the resilience requirement. Backup path design rules are developed, and the condition for backup path availability is derived for the special mesh-type GMPLS network. Finally, a simple example is shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience model and path management mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Packet-based optical access ring is becoming a promising solution in metropolitan networks. Its performance depends mainly on how optical resource sharing takes place among the different competing access nodes. This network architecture has mostly been explored with regard to synchronous transmission (i.e., slotted WDM ring). However, in this article we focus on the performance of asynchronous transmission-based networks with variable packet sizes. We investigate the fairness issue that is likely to arise between upstream and downstream nodes sharing a common data channel. Furthermore, we show that sharing the channel's available bandwidth fairly but arbitrarily between access nodes, as in slotted WDM rings, does not resolve the fairness problem in asynchronous systems. In this regard, we exhibit the inherent limitations of the token bucket access rate-based algorithm once applied to asynchronous transmission bus-based networks. To alleviate the aforementioned problem, we devise a new strategy called traffic control architecture using remote descriptors (TCARD). The proposed solution is based on a preventive mechanism to grant access to the shared resource. As illustrated in the article, the proposed solution alleviates performance degradation and resource underutilization while achieving fairness among bus nodes.",

      "abstract": "Deployment of wireless LANs includes two main design issues: selection of access point locations and access point frequency assignments. Properly solving these issues normally involves a trial and error process, and can be very time consuming. The Rollabout design tool partially automates this process, making it quicker and more efficient. When pushed around on a rolling cart, the system collects data from access points and automatically creates a coverage map. With Rollabout, data collection is much faster, and a much larger set of data can be captured. Furthermore, the design tool predicts the coverage changes that result when access points are moved to different locations. It also can produce an optimal set of frequency assignments for any set of access point locations and corresponding coverage areas.",

Current methods may often be plagued with problems such as poor typing efficiency, stringent physical size limitations, and an unwarranted cognitive processing burden on mobile users. The proposed text entry method for mobile communication devices, called SIMKEYS, balances input efficiency, ergonomics, usability, and cost via a compact 12-button keypad. Pursuing a deterministic and linguistically optimized approach to character disambiguation, SIMKEYS achieves significant improvement in typing performance over existing methods, verified by extensive simulation results. It also consumes negligible amounts of system resources and incurs minimal development costs. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, SIMKEYS opens the door to exciting opportunities in the next stage of development of the wireless Internet.",

      "abstract": "Passive optical networks have been identified as promising access solutions that can open the first-mile bottleneck, bringing gigabits-per-second data rates to end users. Current TDM PONs enjoy low cost by sharing resources in time, but suffer from limited capacity. In the future, WDM technology may be employed to achieve high performance. In this article we introduce a novel PON employing dynamic wavelength allocation to provide bandwidth sharing across multiple physical PONs. Tunable lasers, arrayed waveguide gratings, and coarse/fine filtering combine to create a flexible new optical access solution. The network's excellent scalability can bridge the gap between conventional TDM PONs and WDM PONs. The powerful architecture is a promising candidate for next-generation optical access networks.",

      "abstract": "A variety of hybrid systems combining third-generation mobile communication networks with broadcast systems have been proposed for the delivery of multimedia broadcast multicast services (MBMS) to mobile users. The article discusses one of these alternatives, which involves the use of a geostationary satellite component for MBMS delivery. In particular, it proposes a radio access scheme for the satellite component of the system that features maximum commonalities with the standardized T-UMTS WCDMA-based interface. The ultimate advantages of this approach are more efficient delivery of MBMS as far as the mobile network operator is concerned. The required adaptations at the interface layers are described, and the radio resource management strategy that fulfills the particular requirements of the satellite system is presented.",

Although suggested in a number of specific cases, selective encryption could be much more widely used in consumer electronic applications ranging from mobile multimedia terminals through digital cameras were it subjected to a more thorough security analysis. We describe selective encryption and develop a simple scaler quantizer example to demonstrate the power of the concept, list a number of potential consumer electronics applications, and then describe an appropriate method for developing and analyzing selective encryption for particular compression algorithms. We summarize results from application of this method to the MPEG-2 video compression algorithm.",

After an exposition of the rationale behind an optical SLA, parameters that could be included in this O-SLA, as well as their values for four classes of services are proposed. Different client (wavelength or subwavelength) and service types (from leased wavelength to bandwidth on demand) are distinguished when necessary. The last part of this article presents issues related to the provisioning of services emanating from this O-SLA.",

In this concept, we allow for additional sharing of important node devices in order to reduce network cost. These node devices (e.g., optical-electronic-optical regenerators and pure all-optical converters) constitute the dominant cost factor in an optical backbone network, and reduction of their number is of paramount importance. For demonstration purposes, we extend the concept of 1:N shared path protection to allow for the sharing of electronic regenerators needed to cope with optical transmission impairments. Considerable cost reductions in electronic budget are demonstrated through numerical examples.",

This article first gives an overview of the diverse routing problem for both types of protection in mesh networks, path-base and segment shared protection; then the cost function and link state for performing diverse routing are defined by which the maximum extent of resource sharing can be explored in the complete routing information scenario. Review is conducted on the most recently reported survivable routing schemes along with state-of-the-art progress in diverse routing algorithms for segment shared protection. The following three reported algorithms are discussed in detail: iterative two-step-approach, potential backup cost, and maximum likelihood relaxation.",

      "abstract": "The adaptation of smart antenna techniques in future wireless systems is expected to have a significant impact on the efficient use of the spectrum, the minimization of the cost of establishing new wireless networks, the optimization of service quality, and realization of the transparent operation across multitechnology wireless networks. Nevertheless, its success relies on two considerations that have been often overlooked when investigating smart antenna technologies: first, the smart antennas features need to be considered early in the design phase of future systems (top-down compatibility); second, a realistic performance evaluation of smart antenna technique needs to be performed according to the critical parameters associated with future systems requirements (bottom-up feasibility). In this article an overview of the benefits of and most recent advances in smart antenna transceiver architecture is given first. Then the most important trends in the adoption of smart antennas in future system are presented, such as reconfigurability to varying channel propagation and network conditions, cross-layer optimization, and multi-user diversity, as well as challenges such as the design of a suitable simulation methodology and the accurate modeling of channel characteristics, interference, and implementation losses. Finally, market trends, future projections, and the expected financial impact of smart antenna systems deployment are discussed.",

However, sustained improvements in the throughput of WLANs, while also supporting robust long-range operation, requires the use of multiple antennas at both the mobile terminal and the access point. This article reviews the various space-time coding and decoding technologies employed for capitalizing on the increased capacity of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radio channel.

      "abstract": "This article describes the technical challenges that have to be met when implementing the interesting new technology of spectrum pooling. This notion represents the coexistence of two mobile radio systems within the same frequency range. It enables the secondary utilization of already licensed frequency bands as aimed at by several regulatory authorities worldwide. The goal of spectrum pooling is to enhance spectral efficiency by overlaying a new mobile radio system on an existing one without requiring any changes to the actual licensed system. Several demanding tasks originate from this idea. Some of them have been solved in recent research projects. Others are subject to ongoing investigations. Here, the state of the art in spectrum pooling is presented.",

Native fibre channel or end-to-end fibre channel-based solutions can be offered over long distances using SONET-based networks. Protocols such as Internet SCSI (iSCSI), Internet fibre channel protocol (iFCP) and fibre channel over TCP/IP (FCIP) are being proposed to enable storage area networking solutions over networks that use IP as their transport protocol. Performance analysis of these solutions in terms of application throughput under variable network conditions of packet loss, bandwidth availability, extension distance, and TCP implementations in the sender and receiver is presented based on analytical modeling of different solutions.",

      "abstract": "In this article we refer to the market of vehicular networks, where groups of customers located in the same public vehicle (e.g., a train or bus) connect to a terrestrial network through a wireless/satellite backbone link. Elastic buffering is a proxy management technique devised to decouple the multimedia information retrieval rate on the network backbone from the playout streaming rate at the user terminal. It has been shown in the past that the application of elastic buffering mechanisms in terrestrial networks brings significant advantages in terms of network effectiveness. We show that elastic buffering is an extremely effective means to reduce, or even eliminate, streaming service outage due to intermittent backbone connectivity, such as that occurring when a vehicle moves through tunnels. Moreover, we show that elastic buffering is not only a technique suitable for multimedia information retrieval services, but can be effectively applied to delayed real-time services.",

      "abstract": "In this article an automated manager called traffic engineering automated manager (TEAM) for DiffServ/MPLS networks is introduced, and its design and implementation details are discussed. TEAM is designed for complete automated management of an Internet domain. TEAM is an adaptive manager that provides the required quality of service to the users and reduces the congestion in the network. The former is achieved by reserving bandwidth resources for the requests and the latter by distributing the load efficiently. These goals are achieved by online measurements of the network state. TEAM is composed of a traffic engineering tool (TET), which adaptively manages the bandwidth and routes in the network, a measurement and performance evaluation tool (MPET), which measures important parameters in the network and inputs them to the TET, and a simulation tool (ST), which may be used by TET to consolidate its decisions. These three tools work in synergy to achieve the desired network operation objectives. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of TEAM as a network manager in different and unpredictable traffic conditions at the expense of a limited increase in the computational complexity and costs.",

      "abstract": "Reconfigurable radio in Europe is rapidly gaining momentum and becoming a key enabler for realizing the vision of being optimally connected anywhere, anytime. At the center of this exciting technology is the reconfigurable terminal that will move across different radio access networks, adapting at every instant to an optimum mode of operation. This will require coordinated reconfiguration management support from both the terminal and the network, but the terminal will inherit a significant part of this intelligence. This article focuses on a novel reconfigurable terminal architecture that advances the state of the art and encompasses the overall protocol stack from the physical to application layer in IP-based radio access networks. The proposed architecture is composed of a terminal reconfiguration management part and enabling middleware technologies like the complementary Distributed Processing Environment and agent platforms, flexible protocol stacks that can flexibly be interchanged to support different wireless technologies and associated mechanisms, and finally, object-oriented reconfigurable RF and baseband components. The work presented in this article is conducted in the context of the IST projects SCOUT (www.ist-scout.org) and TRUST (www4.in.tum.de/-scout/trust webpage/spl I.bar/src/ trust frameset.html) of the European 5th Framework Program.",

As the percentage of packet-oriented traffic in the overall traffic demand continues to rise, prompted by the widespread adoption of the Internet protocol suite, and recently by the fast adoption of Ethernet services, there is increasing pressure to improve the service provider's transport infrastructure in ways that make it data-aware and cost-effective for packet-oriented applications. Steps in this direction include the adoption of native physical interfaces, for Ethernet and storage area networks as service interfaces, or full integration of packet switching capabilities from Ethernet, resilient packet ring, and MPLS technologies. This article discusses the emerging building blocks for next-generation data-aware transport networks and next-generation transport network elements.",

This processor includes partial response maximum likelihood, a data processor block, and servo blocks. The nonlinear equalizer is designed to boost high-frequency signal components without increasing intersymbol interference. It can improve the quality of the high-frequency signal fed into the Viterbi detector, reduce jitter, and offer more tilt margins to the system. Due to the proposed nonlinear equalizer in PRML, less than 2 \u00d7 10/sup -4/ of the symbol error rate (SER), defined as the BD format book, is achieved with the tangential tilt margin of /spl plusmn/0.5/spl deg/. This system on a chip carries DP functions of a parity preserve/prohibit repeat minimum transition runlength (RMTR) (17PP) modem, Reed-Solomon (RS) codec, and buffer management. The Teaklite DSP is embedded for control functions such as focus servo, track servo, and auto calibration. It contains 12 million transistors in a 50 mm<sup>2</sup> die, and is fabricated in 0.18 \u03bcm 1-poly 5-metal (1P5M) CMOS technology.",

This is the paradigm of a primary working path protected end-to-end by a disjoint backup path using shared spare capacity. Sharing is arranged among the backup paths associated with other primary paths that are failure-disjoint from the current primary path. This approach called shared backup path protection (SBPP) has many advantages but also provides a great deal of network state information to be available and current in every node. It also makes the arrangement of protection a per-connection task, rather than user-selectable service option supported by the network itself. We propose an alternative paradigm for consideration, partly summed up as provisioning over protected capacity rather than provisioning protection. Under a given distribution of spare capacity, locally acting protection or restoration schemes create an \"envelope\" of protected working channels. Dynamic provisioning within this envelope is simplified to a shortest path routing problem and (depending on the mode of operation) requires little or no dissemination of state changes on a per-connection basis. We explain how existing \"static\" capacity design methods can be adopted to the dimensioning of such a working capacity envelope and the envelope dimensions further adapted online to track evolution of the overall pattern of random demand. An important property is that nothing needs to be done to arrange protection for services on the per-connection timescale other than routing the service itself. Arbitrarily fast-paced demand arrivals and departures can be accommodated within a static distribution of spare capacity. Adjustments to the envelope itself are required only on the timescale on which the statistical parameters of the random demand changes. This may provide an inherently more scalable, less database-dependent, and higher-availability alternative than SBPP, or at least an additional service modality that can be offered to customers.",

      "abstract": "How to protect location privacy of mobile users is an important issue in ubiquitous computing. However, location privacy protection is particularly challenging: on one hand, the administration requires all legitimate users to provide identity information in order to grant them permission to use its wireless service; on the other hand, mobile users would prefer not to expose any information that could enable anyone, including the administration, to get some clue regarding their whereabouts; mobile users would like to have complete personal control of their location privacy. To address this issue, we propose an authorized-anonymous-ID-based scheme; this scheme effectively eliminates the need for a trusted server or administration, which is assumed in the previous work. Our key weapon is a cryptographic technique called blind signature, which is used to generate an authorized anonymous ID that replaces the real ID of an authorized mobile device. With authorized anonymous IDs, we design an architecture capable of achieving complete personal control over location privacy while maintaining the authentication function required by the administration.",

In particular, we argue that end-to-end measurement based admission control (EMBAC), which employs end-to-end on-demand probing, should be used for call admission control. Second, we consider use of EMBAC in VoIP networks. We present a new probability-based EMBAC scheme and show that its performance is close to the ideal method using virtual-trunk-based admission control. We also present a QoS allocation approach for selecting an admission threshold and dimensioning link capacities. A simple network design and evaluation results suggest that this QoS allocation approach is effective to adequately dimension a network, while satisfying end-to-end targets in terms of blocking probability and packet loss rate.",

A distinctive property of turbo-MIMO wireless communication systems is that they can attain a channel capacity close to the Shannon limit and do so in a computationally manageable manner. The article focuses attention on a subclass of turbo-MIMO systems that use space-time coding based on bit-inter-leaved coded modulation. Different computationally manageable decoding (detection) strategies are briefly discussed. The article also includes computer experiments that are intended to improve the understanding of specific issues involved in the design of turbo-MIMO systems.",

      "abstract": "The research topic of sensor networks has been around for some time. With improvements in device size, power consumption, communications, and computing technology, sensor networks are becoming more popular for an ever increasing range of applications. Since 2002, there has been an increased in the popularity of commercial applications based on ultra wideband. This, in turn, has ignited interest in the use of this technology for sensor networks and fuelled research in the area. Impulse-radio-based UWB technology has a number of inherent properties that are well suited to sensor network applications. In particular, UWB systems have potentially low complexity and low cost, have noise-like signal, are resistant to severe multipath and jamming, and have very good time domain resolution allowing for location and tracking applications. This article examines one example of a UWB sensor network for outdoor sport and lifestyle applications.",

The UOWC terminal includes an optical transmitter and a receiver positioned, for example, on high-rise buildings separated by several hundred meters. Light beams propagating through the atmosphere carry the information from the transmitter to the receiver. UOWC boasts many advantages over its rivals. Notably, UOWC facilitates rapidly deployable, lightweight, high-capacity communication without licensing fees and tariffs. However, UOWC still faces many challenges, including how to improve communication performance in adverse weather conditions or during building sway. We present and evaluate some of the exciting new research approaches that have been suggested to deal with these issues, including optimization of telescope gain, new technologies for pointing systems, and solutions at the network level.",

Several commercial and open source VPN products are now available that can be configured to provide VPN services with varying characteristics. This article studies some of the most popular open-source Linux-based VPN solutions (OSLVs) and compares them with respect to network performance (measured in terms of overhead, bandwidth utilization, and latency/jitter), features and functionalities (e.g., algorithm plugins and routing), and operational concerns (defined by security and scalability). Our experiments suggest that there is no single OSLV solution that excels in all considered aspects, and a combination of different VPN products and/or trade-off among desired characteristics may be required to deliver optimal performance. Our experiments also suggest that on an average, OSLVs using UDP-based tunnels have 50 percent lower overhead, 80 percent higher bandwidth utilization, and 40-60 percent lower latency/jitter than those using TCP.",

      "abstract": "Voice over IP services offer important revenue-generating opportunities, as well as many technical challenges in providing high-quality services. Users have come to expect highly available telecommunications services with high-quality voice. Service providers need reliable high-performance networks to meet user expectations, and must be able to guarantee performance and reliability to their customers. In converged voice and data networks, the network infrastructure must deliver very high quality and availability for some customer needs, while also providing low-cost high-capacity bandwidth for other needs. The use of quality of service mechanisms to provide prioritization for various traffic types is a key element needed for voice and data network convergence. However, it is not sufficient if the underlying networks are unreliable. The focus of this article is to address the reliability aspects of VoIP services, including the underlying IP networks.",

      "abstract": "Feedback in a communications system can enable the transmitter to exploit channel conditions and avoid interference. In the case of a multiple-input multiple-output channel, feedback can be used to specify a precoding matrix at the transmitter, which activates the strongest channel modes. In situations where the feedback is severely limited, important issues are how to quantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in associated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback available. We give an overview of some recent work in this area. Methods are presented for constructing a set of possible precoding matrices, from which a particular choice can be relayed to the transmitter. Performance results show that even a few bits of feedback can provide performance close to that with full channel knowledge at the transmitter.",

      "abstract": "The new IEEE standard 802.15.4 shows promise to bring ubiquitous networking into our lives, at least technically. Unlike other standards targeting high- or moderate-data-rate applications, IEEE 802.15.4 is a global standard designed for low-data-rate, low power consumption, and low-cost applications. This so-called enabling standard brings many simple, originally standalone devices into networks, and thus not only open the door to an enormous number of new applications, but also add values to many other existing applications. In this article we first present a few application scenarios to show the potential extent to which the new standard can affect our lives, and then give an overview of the standard, focusing on its feasibility and functions in establishing ubiquitous networks. We also outline some quantitative results from our experiments so as to have a better view of the standard.",

      "abstract": "As the Internet continues to grow, the tasks of operations and management of IP networks and systems are becoming more difficult. Over the past few years, much effort has been given to improve the deficiencies of SNMP, but most have failed to be standardized. One critical deficiency of SNMP is in the area of configuration management. Recent work focuses on the use of XML technology for network and service management as an alternative or complementary approach to SNMP. This article presents the IETF's latest effort, Netconf, which is viewed by many as a promising revolutionary solution for configuration management. To validate this new effort, we present the design and implementation of an XML-based configuration management system based on Netconf. We also discuss our experience with XCMS and make some suggestions for improving the current Netconf protocol.",

The goal of the airConn project is to define an architecture and a prototype implementation that enable the provision of premium and non-premium service tiers for both transient and nontransient users of wireless hot spots. airConn provides for dynamic renegotiation of service tiers and facilitates various billing modes. Thus, it enables service providers to increase their revenue opportunities via multiple flexibility manageable service offerings.",
