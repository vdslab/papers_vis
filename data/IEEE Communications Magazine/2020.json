      "abstract": "In this work, we put forth a philosophical treatise on a novel paradigm for intangible, on-demand, and power-free aerial communication relaying, for which we coin the term \"phantom network.\" The proposed phantom network aims to temporarily bridge communication gaps between two or more out-of-range communicating devices or infrastructures using aerial nanonodes suspended in atomized aqueous mists. This proposed on-demand shoot-and-scoot communication enabler is of particular interest to scenarios where there is a need for rapid deployment of temporary communication or relaying infrastructures for enabling higher data volume communication networks, primarily associated with military operations. As the conceptualized aerial network is primarily aqueous, its coverage and lifetime are highly dependent on ensuing atmospheric conditions in the deployment area. The possible future use of this proposed paradigm includes establishing temporary infrastructure-free networks during disaster management and battlefield communications. We discuss the design and implementation challenges posed by the intended on-demand aerial nano-network-based communication relaying paradigm, its application horizon, and scope for future work.",

      "abstract": "Since Release 13, the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and LTE for machine-type communications (LTE-M) provide wide-area connectivity for IoT. In subsequent releases, their basic functionalities evolved to support higher data rates, enhanced mobility, and power saving features. In Release 16, Preconfigured Uplink Resources (PUR) introduce the possibility to assign radio resources to a user equipment (UE) in advance for transmission of uplink data without the need of connection setup. In this article we show that the UE power saving gain from PUR compared to existing features is largest if data transmissions are relatively frequent and payloads are small enough to be transmitted in a single shot. For example, with periodicity of 30 s, 50 bytes payload, and 43 min extended discontinuous reception (eDRX) cycle, the gain for PUR compared to early data transmission (EDT) ranges from 50 percent in good coverage to 7 percent in deep coverage.",

      "abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) mobile network is standardized and developed to explore the mobile market beyond 2020. In response to the diverse strategies of 5G deployment, five alternative network architectures have been proposed to 3GPP by different mobile operators. To fulfill the urgent deployment requirement from some operators, an early drop of 5G, termed as non-standalone (NSA) new radio (NR), was completed at the end of 2017. After that, the standardization of a new 5G system, including th standalone (SA) new radio access network, was finished in June 2018. This article analyzes and compares the SA NR and NSA NR deployment modes in terms of coverage, network capability, interworking between 4G and 5G, complexity and cost of network deployment, and the latest industry progress. NSA NR performs better in interworking performance in the initial phase, while SA NR performs better in network capabilities, device performance, simple network deployment, and cost efficiency. 5G SA NR is recommended for operators who have the ambition to explore new opportunities in the vertical and enterprise markets.",

On a high level, the enhancements in Release 16 can be grouped into two categories: improvements of existing features, and introduction of new features addressing new verticals and deployment scenarios. This article provides a brief overview of the enhancements in the first category, followed by a more in-depth discussion of features in the second category. These features include integrated access-backhaul, operation in unlicensed spectrum, intelligent transportation and vehicular-to-anything communication, the Industrial Internet of Things, ultra-reliable low-la-tency communication, and positioning. The article concludes with an outlook on enhancements planned for Release 17.",

      "abstract": "5G introduces different communication types to support novel applications, e.g., industrial control, depending on ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (URLLC) to provide their service. To realize this type of communication, network operators offer virtual end-to-end networks, called network slices, to their customers, and service level agreements of the operators promise a certain quality of service for the provided network slices. The main challenge is the creation of network slices that adhere to these strict requirements despite virtualized resources shared across different network slices. In this article, we analyze the latency performance of typical virtualized network functions. Based on these results, we derive guidelines to lower latency and propose a system architecture for hosting low-latency network functions. We measure the latency performance of a security network function, an intrusion prevention system based on Snort 3, and demonstrate that URLLC-compliant latency performance is achievable. Our entire architecture relies on off-the-shelf hardware and widely adopted software components, making our findings highly applicable to situations where low latency is crucial. All artifacts used in this article, the investigated software, the pcap traces, and the experiments scripts are publicly available at https://gallenmu. github.io/low-latency/.",

      "abstract": "The high capacity of future 5G wireless networks must be supported by equivalent high-capacity fixed networks for backhaul and fronthaul (x-haul) transport. Especially the trend toward densification of radio networks, in which many small cells are located next to macrocells, will call for cost-efficient x-haul solutions to meet the overall business case targets. Optical access technologies bear great potential to offer low-cost solutions for these x-haul transport links. Starting from requirements on bandwidth, latency, and other critical parameters of 5G x-haul transport networks, ITU-T Q2/SG15 has elaborated a generic approach on how to employ PON technologies in various functional split architectures of wireless networks. The proposed PON architectures are presented and discussed in the recently released supplementary document G.Sup66, \"5G Wireless Fronthaul Requirements in a PON Context,\" in October 2018. This article provides a high-level summary of the findings in Supplement G.Sup66.",

In this article, the transport network slice provisioning requirements imposed by network operation and emerging services are investigated. Then we review the 5G E2E network slice control and orchestration architecture. As a component of this architecture, comparing with overlay virtualization, an optical underlay virtualization provisioning framework (including topology, bandwidth, and control function virtualization) is presented for the first time. Related optical underlay data plane slicing techniques are discussed, especially for two candidates recently proposed in ITU-T: M-OTN and SPN, with FlexO and FlexE as their key enablers. Finally, several significant challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the vision of optical underlay network slicing and then E2E slicing are investigated.",

      "abstract": "Lots of hopes have been placed on machine learning (ML) as a key enabler of future wireless networks. By taking advantage of large volumes of data, ML is expected to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of networking problems. Unfortunately, current networks are not yet prepared to support the ensuing requirements of ML-based applications in terms of data collection, processing, and output distribution. This article points out the architectural requirements that are needed to pervasively include ML as part of future wireless networks operation. Specifically, we look into wireless local area networks (WLANs), which, due to their nature, can be found in multiple forms, ranging from cloud-based to edge-computing-like deployments. In particular, we propose to adopt the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) unified architecture for 5G and beyond. Based on ITU's architecture, we provide insights on the main requirements and the major challenges of introducing ML to the multiple modalities of WLANs. Finally, we showcase the superiority of the architecture through an ML-enabled use case for future networks.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of mobile wireless systems into heterogeneous networks, along with the introduction of fifth generation systems, significantly increased the complexity of radio resource management. Current mobile networks consist of a multitude of spectrum bands, use cases, system features, licensing schemes, radio technologies, and network layers. Additionally, the traffic demand is uneven in terms of spatial and temporal domains, calling for a dynamic approach to radio resource allocation. To cope with these complexities, a generic and adaptive scheme is required for efficient operation of heterogeneous networks. This article proposes using a hierarchical and modular framework as an approach to cover the mentioned challenges and to generalize this scheme to different network layers. The proposed management solution is based on three main components: specialized solutions for individual requirements, exposed to the coordination layer, through abstraction middleware. In this approach, new items can be added as \"plugins\".",

      "abstract": "User-centric and low-latency communications can be enabled not only by small cells but also through ubiquitous connectivity. Recently, the vertical heterogeneous network (V-HetNet) architecture has been proposed to backhaul/fronthaul a large number of small cells. Like an orchestra, the V-HetNet is a polyphony of different communication ensembles, including geostationary Earth orbit and low Earth orbit satellites (e.g., CubeSats), and networked flying platforms along with terrestrial communication links. In this study, we propose terahertz (THz) communications to enable the elements of V-HetNets to function in harmony. As THz links offer large bandwidth, leading to ultra-high data rates, it is suitable for backhauling and fronthauling small cells. Furthermore, THz communications can support numerous applications from inter-satellite links to in-vivo nanonetworks. However, to savor this harmony, we need accurate channel models. In this article, the insights obtained through our measurement campaigns are highlighted to reveal the true potential of THz communications in V-HetNets.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we propose a hybrid positioning system (HPS) for various seamless localization applications. The base stations in the HPS incorporate four wireless protocols, namely, WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and utral-wideband (UWB); as a result, the HPS shows better target detection because it can localize persons/ objects with different positioning devices (e.g., smartphone, UWB tag, Bluetooth tag) simultaneously. Moreover, it also exhibits good environmental adaptability because it can be deployed in different environments. We first present the system architecture of our HPS and then delve into the main hardware constituents. We detail the functions of each protocol for efficient positioning. The main motivation behind the design of our HPS is to realize a robust and precise indoor and outdoor seamless positioning system that is universally deployable from small to large-scale environments. Our HPS can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of existing standalone positioning systems and provide sufficient space for information fusion to yield more accurate positioning. Experimental results in a typical office environment have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed HPS in comparison with different fusion strategies. Two case studies are included to validate the powerful functions for providing personalized location- based services.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity has a major role in the current transformation of smart manufacturing. 5G is foreseen as an integral part of an end-to-end networking infrastructure supporting smart manufacturing operation. The integration of 5G with time-sensitive networking (TSN)is seen as a holistic communication solution for smart factories. The next generation of industrialization consists of real-time processes, automation, fixed and cellular networks, and high diversity of devices. The integration of fixed and cellular devices in a single infrastructure to enable end-to-end deterministic communications requires high accuracy of time synchronization. The transport technologies in fixed networks have been evolving toward TSN and deterministic networking to fulfill the requirements for industrial communications. The latest cellular specifications for 5G are targeting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications that enable the Industrial Internet of Things. This article describes the state of the art for integrating TSN with 5G networks based on the support given in 3GPP TS 23.501 Release 16. The requirements for time synchronization in factory automation and integration with 5G networks are presented, together with the most recent advancements in the standardization process.",

      "abstract": "Fog computing is considered to be a key enabling technology for future networks. By broadening the cloud computing services to the network edge, fog computing can support various emerging applications such as IoT, big data, and blockchain with low latency and low bandwidth consumption cost. To achieve the full potential of fog computing, it is essential to design an incentive mechanism for fog computing service providers. Auction is a promising solution for the incentive mechanism design. However, it is challenging to design an optimal auction that maximizes the revenue for the providers while holding important properties: IR and IC. Therefore, this article introduces the design of an optimal auction based on deep learning for the resource allocation in fog computing. The proposed optimal auction is developed specifically to support blockchain applications. In particular, we first discuss resource management issues in fog computing. Second, we review economic and pricing models for resource management in fog computing. Third, we introduce fog computing and blockchain. Fourth, we present how to design the optimal auction by using deep learning for the fog resource allocation in the blockchain network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline scheme (i.e., the greedy algorithm) in terms of revenue, and IC and IR violations. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used as a useful tool for the optimal resource allocation in general fog networks.",

Advances in machine learning and parallel computing underpin new powerful tools that have the potential to tackle these complex challenges. In this article, we develop a general machinelearning- based framework that leverages artificial intelligence to forecast future traffic demands and characterize traffic features. This makes it possible to exploit such traffic insights to improve the performance of critical network control mechanisms, such as load balancing, routing, and scheduling. In contrast to prior works that design problem-specific machine learning algorithms, our generic approach can be applied to different network functions, allowing reuse of existing control mechanisms with minimal modifications. We explain how our framework can orchestrate ML to improve two different network mechanisms. Further, we undertake validation by implementing one of these, mobile backhaul routing, using data collected by a major European operator and demonstrating a 3\u00d7reduction of the packet delay compared to traditional approaches.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring a high degree of customer satisfaction is critical to the success of telecom companies in maintaining or increasing market share. Using churn prediction as an indicator of customer satisfaction, we present a robust system that allows telecom companies to gauge the perceived quality of service delivery. The system employs a novel approach known as the churn drift detection method (CDDM), which can effectively predict customer churn by simultaneously addressing the interdependent problems of concept drift and class imbalance in raw data. We have applied CDDM to the call detail record (CDR) of a south Asian telecom company for churn prediction. By measuring criteria like prediction error and detection delay, experiments have shown that on average, CDDM gives 3 percent less prediction error, 50 percent less detection delay, and almost 1-2 percent better evaluation time than existing techniques.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we envision a hybrid opto-acoustic network design for IoUT. The software defined underwater network (SDUN) is presented as an enabler of hybridizing benefits of optic and acoustic systems and adapting IoUT nodes to the challenging and dynamically changing underwater environment. We explain inextricably interwoven relations among functionalities of different SDUN layers and analyze their impacts on key network attributes. The NFV concept is then introduced to realize application-specific cross-layer protocol suites through an NFV management and orchestration system. We finally discuss how SDUN and NFV can slice available network resources as per the diverging service demands of different underwater applications. Such a revolutionary architectural paradigm shift is not only a cure for chronic underwater networking problems but also a way of smoothly integrating IoUT and IoT ecosystems.",

The study compares two optical disaggregation options (partial vs. total) against the legacy benchmark where optical equipment is subject to vendor lock-in, as it is deployed in most networks today. We show that emerging open source software projects within the software-defined networking ecosystem can potentially yield significant cost savings for medium- and large-size network operators, while they can introduce extra flexibility and agility to network operations and service deployments.",

      "abstract": "RF spectrum represents a limited natural resource. The increasing numbers of wireless devices demand more and more spectrum for diverse future applications and services. CR is explored as a technological solution to the current paradigm of spectrum scarcity by opportunistically sharing the spectrum with licensed users. FD operation further enhances the performance of CR with higher throughput and optimized sensing time. Tactical radios are traditionally operated in the licensed frequency bands. To comply with the soaring demands, alternative means are explored to share the spectrum among tactical users. In this article, an FD-CR integrated with tri-band operation and dynamic spectrum shaping is proposed for tactical communications. The proposed radio is implemented in the Zynq SDR platform. The performance results reveal that the FD-CR offers higher throughput, higher probability of detection (Pd &gt; 0.9), and optimized sensing time, which empowers the system to be ideally suitable for tactical communication networks.",

In this evolving framework, old assumptions and constraints specific to satellite communications must be carefully re-assessed. To this aim, we revisit the role of the performance enhancing proxy (PEP), replaced by a chain of custom virtual network functions properly enabled to optimize common web traffic performance over a backhaul dynamically enabled with a supplementary satellite link. The resulting virtual PEP (vPEP) is compliant with the breakthrough virtualization and slicing paradigms and can fruitfully exploit the advanced features of the most recent IETF technologies such as QUIC and MPTCP.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the design and implementation of a novel DCN system, which utilizes a knowledge-defined NO-M to operate a HOEDCN cost-effectively and energy-efficiently. The motivations behind the proposed HOE-DCN system are the urgent need to address the scalability, energy, and manageability issues in existing DCN systems. To realize the knowledge-defined NO-M, we follow the principle of predictive analytics in the human brain to design three artificial intelligence modules based on deep learning and make them operate collaboratively. The proposed HOE-DCN system is implemented in a network testbed, and we conduct experiments that involve both control and data plane operations to demonstrate its advantages. The experimental results show that the HOE-DCN simultaneously achieves high-performance service provisioning and improved energy efficiency. Furthermore, by analyzing the pros and cons of the HOE-DCN system, we also point out several directions to work on in the future.",

An emerging paradigm is employing SmartNIC for network-centric computing, which introduces user-specific processing at a host's network interface. In this article, we take this initiative further to tackle current proprietary processing and computing issues in the network core: the switches. We propose a new hardware architecture called adaptable switch. Based on testing of its prototype empowering three use cases, we demonstrate that both high throughput and processing flexibility can be achieved simultaneously on an adaptable switch.",

      "abstract": "Spectrum sharing has been recognized as a key component for 5G and beyond wireless networks. Recent trials have revealed the business value of spectrum sharing via the licensed shared access model, wherein both the incumbent and the licensee operators are protected from harmful interference by sharing the available spectrum using long-term spectrum access agreements. Further increase in capacity gains can be achieved by exploiting dynamic spectrum access, where access is granted in shorter time intervals, and the Spectrum Access System, which is a more flexible version of traditional LSA. This article first hints at LSA-type spectrum sharing in regulatory and standards bodies, then proposes a few relevant scenarios that would take advantage of LSA, and finally presents an LSA system architecture and some enabling technologies for LSA/DSA/SAS. These include novel sensing, dynamic and radioaware resource allocation, and advanced cooperative communication techniques.",

      "abstract": "Employing low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for millimeter-wave receivers with large antenna arrays provides an opportunity to efficiently reduce power consumption of the receiver. Reducing ADC resolution, however, results in performance degradation due to non-negligible quantization error. In addition, the large number of radio frequency chains is still not desirable. Accordingly, conventional low-resolution ADC systems require more efficient designs to minimize the cost and complexity while maximizing performance. In this article, we discuss advanced low-resolution ADC receiver architectures that further improve the spectral and energy efficiency trade-off. To reduce both the numbers of RF chains and ADC bits, hybrid analog and digital beamforming is jointly considered with low-resolution ADCs. We explore the challenges in designing such receivers and present key insights on how the advanced architectures overcome such challenges. As alternative low-resolution ADC receivers, we also introduce receivers with learning-based detection. The receiver does not require explicit channel estimation, and thus is suitable for one-bit ADC systems. Finally, future challenges and research issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)- based communication in millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies to provide on-demand radio access is a promising approach to improve capacity and coverage in beyond-5G (B5G) systems. There are several design aspects to be addressed when optimizing for the deployment of such UAV base stations. As traffic demand of mobile users varies across time and space, dynamic algorithms that correspondingly adjust the UAV locations are essential to maximize performance. In addition to careful tracking of spatio-temporal user/traffic activity, such optimization needs to account for realistic backhaul constraints. In this work, we first review the latest 3GPP activities behind integrated access and backhaul system design, support for UAV base stations, and mmWave radio relaying functionality. We then compare static and mobile UAV-based communication options under practical assumptions on the mmWave system layout, mobility and clusterization of users, antenna array geometry, and dynamic backhauling. We demonstrate that leveraging the UAV mobility to serve moving users may improve the overall system performance even in the presence of backhaul capacity limitations.",

Moreover, NATO activities are multi-nation engagements, and necessitate communications between member countries and from the theater of operations back to command centers. The NATO IST-172 research task group is investigating non-satellite and non-high-frequency methodologies for beyond line-of-sight communications, creating links between disparate battlefield nodes. The study, which has yet to have conclusions and recommendations, is examining existing and emerging capabilities within the NATO member nations, and considering their applicability to six representative communications scenarios. Link budgets, ease of interoperability between member nations, frequency coordination considerations and existing radio hardware are all to be included in the analysis.",

      "abstract": "The probability of the occurrence of faults increases manifolds when program lines of code exceed a few thousand in ubiquitous applications. Fault mitigation in ubiquitous applications, such as those of autonomous vehicular technologies (VTs), has not been effective even with the use of formal methods. Faults in such applications require exhaustive testing for a timely fix, which seems infeasible computationally. This emphasizes the imperative role of software fault tolerance (SFT) for autonomous applications. Several SFT techniques have been proposed, but failures revealed in VT applications imply that existing SFT techniques need to be fine-tuned. In this article, current replication-based SFT techniques are analyzed and classified with respect to their diversity, adjudication, and adaptivity. Essential parameters (reliability, time, variance, etc.) for adjudication, diversity, and adaptiveness are recorded. The identified parameters are mapped to different techniques (e.g., AFTRC, SCOP, VFT) for observing their shortcomings. Consequently, a generic framework named Diverse Parallel Adjudication for Software Fault Tolerance (DPA-SFT) is proposed. DPA-SFT addresses the shortcomings of existing SFT techniques for VTs with the added value of parallel and diverse adjudication. A prototype implementation of the proposed framework has been developed for assessing the viability of DPA-SFT over modules of VT. An empirical comparison of the proposed framework is performed with prevalent techniques (AFTRC, SCOP, VFT, etc). A thorough evaluation suggests that DPA-SFT performs better than contemporary SFT techniques in VTs due to its parallel and diverse adjudication.",

Aqua-Fi uses an LED or laser to support bidirectional wide-range communication services with different requirements, low cost, and simple implementation. LEDs introduce robust short distance solutions with low power requirements. However, laser extends the communication distance and improves the transmission rate at the cost of higher power requirements. Throughout this work, we discuss the proposed Aqua-Fi system architecture, limitations, and solutions to improve data rates and deliver reliable communication links.",

      "abstract": "As 3GPP has completed Release 16 specifications and worldwide 5G commercialization is speeding up, global interest in 6G is starting to grow. An interesting and important question is: will the rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) eventually alleviate the tremendous efforts required for future standardization of 6G and beyond? In this article, the potential impacts of AI on the air interface design and standardization are investigated. The AI-enabled network architecture is first discussed. The higher layer, physical layer, and cross-layer design empowered by AI capability are further presented. Based on these designs, the future 6G and beyond are expected to enter into an AI era. For potential new use cases and more challenging requirements, the network is capable of automatic updating the air interface protocols, which may substantially reduce the standardization efforts and costs of wireless communication networks.",

      "abstract": "Predicting traffic by exploiting its regularity in spatio- temporal variation enables intelligent resource provisioning and management in wireless networks. Traditional prediction techniques are largely based on exploiting traffic spatio-temporal correlation, that is, the statistical relationship between the current traffic and the historical data in a single cell (temporal correlation) or neighboring cells (spatial correlation). Such an approach is effective in predicting the regular components in traffic. However, as traffic types are becoming increasingly diversified, the random components in traffic are becoming dominant. This results in decreasing accuracy in correlation-based prediction techniques. In view of the limitation of existing techniques, we propose a new approach of traffic prediction by exploiting the predictable causality in wireless traffic, which arises from the causal relationship between the occurrences of special events and the triggered traffic variations. Building on the approach, we propose a novel framework of correlation- and causality-based prediction (Coca-Predict) that integrates the two types of prediction to exploit their complementary strengths to maximize prediction accuracy. Specifically, traffic information in spatio-temporal and other dimensions are fed into the correlation and causality sub-predictors to predict the regular component and variation tendency of the traffic, respectively. Experimental results based on realistic traffic data at a specific airport demonstrate that Coca-Predict outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction techniques by exploiting traffic causality. Finally, open challenges and opportunities for wireless traffic prediction are highlighted to shed light on this important direction in designing intelligent wireless networks.",

Orchestration, network slicing, edge computing, and federation are key technologies enabling industry verticals to have their own virtual networks, which might require aggregating transport networking and computing fabric, from the edge up to the core and cloud. Three novel building blocks are defined to meet these challenges in an automated manner: a vertical slicer as the entry point to create services and request slices, a service orchestrator to manage the services and decide their placement and allocation of required resources, and a mobile transport and computing platform virtualizing infrastructure networking and computing resources in an integrated manner. An experimental evaluation of the developed system shows its feasibility and confirms some of the benefits expected.",

      "abstract": "As an important application of mobile ad hoc networks, VANETs play an important role in intelligent transportation. However, with the development of mobile communication technology, as well as the needs of intelligent transportation, both security and efficiency are required for realtime authentication and communication. Traditional authentication and key distribution schemes suffer from network failure and high response latency. To solve the above problems, this article proposes a BAGKD protocol to achieve robust and efficient networking for the security and efficiency of VANETs. In our protocol, bilinear mapping is used to realize batch authentication, which can improve authentication efficiency and reduce message errors caused by factors such as high speed of vehicles. The group key distribution mechanism can update the group key dynamically, which reduces the risk of group key leakage effectively. For the sake of privacy protection, vehicles utilize pseudonyms issued by a trusted authority to communicate with RSUs. The security of BAGKD protocol is verified by simulation in our experiments on AVISPA. In addition, when compared to three existing protocols based on bilinear mapping, our proposed BAGKD outperforms them in terms of efficiency and communication overhead while maintaining security. The simulation results further confirm that BAGKD is suitable for short-range communication scenarios such as VANETs.",

Optoelectronic terahertz communications are beneficial for realizing 100 Gb/s data rate and beyond, which have greatly promoted the progress of the 6G research. In this article, we give technical insight into the key technologies of optoelectronic terahertz communications with high data rates in the physical layer, including approaches of broadband devices, baseband signal processing technologies, and design of advanced transmission system architectures. A multicarrier signal processing routine with high noise tolerance is proposed and experimentally verified in a 500 Gb/s net rate terahertz communication system. Finally, we discuss the future directions of optoelectronic terahertz technologies toward the target of terabit- scale communications.",

      "abstract": "Current communication networks use design methodologies that prevent the realization of maximum network efficiency. In the first place, while users' perception of satisfactory service diverges widely, current networks are designed to be a \"universal fit,\" where they are generally over-engineered to deliver services appealing to all types of users. Also, current networks lack user-level data cognitive intelligence that would enable fast personalized network decisions and actions through automation. Thus, in this article, we propose the utilization of AI, big data analytics, and real-time non-intrusive user feedback in order to enable the personalization of wireless networks. Based on each user's actual QoS requirements and context, a multi-objective formulation enables the network to micro-manage and optimize the provided QoS and user satisfaction levels simultaneously. Moreover, in order to enable user feedback tracking and measurement, we propose a user satisfaction model based on the zone of tolerance concept. Furthermore, we propose a big-data-driven and AI-based personalization framework to integrate personalization into wireless networks. Finally, we implement a personalized network prototype to demonstrate the proposed personalization concept and its potential benefits through a case study. The case study shows how personalization can be realized to enable the efficient optimization of network resources such that certain requirement levels of user satisfaction and revenue in the form of saved resources are achieved.",

      "abstract": "Mobile network evolution beyond 5G requires a complete rethink of spectrum management. To fulfill unprecedented performance expectations, future 6G networks require fine-grained spectrum sharing in terms of volume, time, and usage area. In this article, we study a novel direction for blockchain integration into the mobile network infrastructure. In particular, we discuss the potential benefits and challenges of the proposed architecture in terms of spectrum and infrastructure sharing. The key implementation aspects of blockchain for 6G, such as a tokenization model for spectrum and infrastructure, the distributed ledger structure, and feasible consensus algorithms, are studied in detail. Finally, we implement three types of smart contracts for service provisioning with semi-persistent, dynamic, and intelligent spectrum trading and analyze the number of transactions for each type. The simulation results show that the average throughput in the case of intelligent spectrum trading is 7 percent higher than that of the semi-persistent trading and 4 percent lower than that of the dynamic trading. From the economic perspective of operators, intelligent trading provides 19 percent more profit than semi-persistent trading and 8 percent less profit than intelligent trading. Intelligent trading also has much lower overhead in the blockchain than dynamic trading, while being very close to the lowest overhead of semi-persistent trading.",

      "abstract": "Network slicing is one of the key enabling techniques for 5G, allowing network providers to support services with diverging requirements on top of their physical infrastructure. In this article, we address the limited support and oversimplified resource allocation on different network segments of existing end-to-end (E2E) orchestration solutions. We propose a hierarchical orchestration scheme for E2E networks, breaking down the E2E resource management and network slicing problems per network segment. We introduce a higher-level orchestrator, the hyperstrator, to coordinate the distributed orchestrators and deploy network slices (NSs) across multiple network segments. We developed a prototype implementation of the hyperstrator and validated our hierarchical orchestration concept with two proofof- concept experiments, showing the NS deployment and the impact of the resource allocation per network segment on the performance of NSs. The results show that the distributed nature of our orchestration architecture introduces negligible overhead for provisioning NSs in our particular setting, and confirm the need of a hyperstrator for coordinating network segments and ensuring consistent QoS for NSs.",

      "abstract": "Data dissemination in Internet of Things (IoT) networks provides a fundamental service for many critical applications. However, traditional dissemination schemes were investigated for an isolated IoT network, and did not fit the coexistence scenario of heterogeneous IoT networks. Motivated by the latest innovations in cross-technology communication (CTC) techniques, this article proposes CDD, a framework utilizing a WiFi-based access point (AP) to simultaneously conduct fast data diffusion in heterogeneous IoT networks (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee). We shed light on the network features in the coexistence scenario and then review the key challenges of coordinating dissemination based on CTC techniques. With these network features and challenges in mind, the CDD framework includes a series of designs to conduct efficient data dissemination in heterogeneous networks using a WiFi AP. The framework is implemented and evaluated on a real-world testbed. The results demonstrate that CDD can reduce the dissemination delay and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.",

To realize this vision, the quality-of-service (QoS) for wireless VR needs to be carefully defined to reflect human perception requirements. In this article, we first identify the primary drivers of VR systems in terms of applications and use cases. We then map the human perception requirements to corresponding QoS requirements for four phases of VR technology development. To shed light on how to provide short/long-range mobility for VR services, we further list four main use cases for cellular-connected wireless VR and identify their unique research challenges along with their corresponding enabling technologies and solutions in 5G systems and beyond. Last but not least, we present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution and the unique QoS performance requirements of VR transmission compared to that of traditional video service in cellular networks.",

By bringing more processing toward the edge of the network, they enable the realization of various demanding applications while supporting numerous resource-constrained devices. Their integration with passive optical networks and their huge offered bandwidth has therefore attracted much research interest. In this article, we review these computing concepts and examine key considerations for their integration with long-reach optical access networks when the employed upstream bandwidth allocation is either centralized or decentralized.",

To this end, significant research efforts in academia and industry have been devoted to the design of optimal resource allocation schemes for RF SWIPT networks. The transmit power constraints imposed by safety regulations introduce significant challenges to the improvement of power transfer performance. Therefore, solely relying on RF resources to cope with the expectations of next-generation wireless networks, such as longer device lifetimes and higher data rates, may no longer be possible. Thus, the investigation of technologies complementary to conventional RF SWIPT is of critical importance. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative RF and lightwave power transfer technology for future networks, where both the RF and lightwave bands can be entirely exploited. In this context, we introduce the basic transceiver architecture and four corresponding collaborative communication and power transfer protocols. Finally, key potential future research directions are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Bringing the success of modern machine learning (ML) techniques to mobile devices can enable many new services and businesses, but also poses significant technical and research challenges. Two factors that are critical for the success of ML algorithms are massive amounts of data and processing power, both of which are plentiful, but highly distributed at the network edge. Moreover, edge devices are connected through bandwidth- and power-limited wireless links that suffer from noise, time variations, and interference. Information and coding theory have laid the foundations of reliable and efficient communications in the presence of channel imperfections, whose application in modern wireless networks has been a tremendous success. However, there is a clear disconnect between the current coding and communication schemes, and the ML algorithms deployed at the network edge. In this article, we challenge the current approach that treats these problems separately, and argue for a joint communication and learning paradigm for both the training and inference stages of edge learning.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things connects a large number of smart mobile devices with the Internet, where these devices are embedded with often limited communication, computation, and caching resources. To address the heterogeneity of these devices and achieve efficient overall system resource utilization, researchers have proposed various device-to-device resource sharing models, enabling mobile devices to form device-todevice connections and to share their resources for cooperative task execution. Most of these existing works, however, considered scenarios where mobile devices can share one or two types of resources, and hence inadequately explore the potential of resource sharing among mobile devices. In this article, we introduce a general framework where mobile devices can share any combination of the three types of resources, and it can generalize many existing deviceto- device resource sharing models. In addition, it can achieve more efficient resource allocation by offering mobile devices more flexibility in terms of resource sharing. Based on the proposed framework, we focus on discussing two issues: the optimization issue, regarding how to schedule resources among devices; and the economic issue, regarding how to motivate the device owners to share their resources. We introduce the challenges and potential solutions to these two issues. We further outline several open issues and future directions for the proposed general resource sharing framework.",

Particularly, edge AI has been envisioned as a major application scenario to provide DNN-based services at edge devices. This article presents effective methods for edge inference at resource-constrained devices. It focuses on device-edge co-inference, assisted by an edge computing server, and investigates a critical trade-off among the computational cost of the on-device model and the communication overhead of forwarding the intermediate feature to the edge server. A general three-step framework is proposed for the effective inference: model split point selection to determine the on-device model, communication-aware model compression to reduce the on-device computation and the resulting communication overhead simultaneously, and task-oriented encoding of the intermediate feature to further reduce the communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a better tradeoff and significantly reduces the inference latency than baseline methods.",

      "abstract": "This article adopts a holistic approach to address the problem of poor broadband connectivity in rural areas by suggesting a novel wireless network architecture called \"Frugal 5G Network.\" To arrive at the Frugal 5G Network architecture, we take into consideration rural connectivity needs and the characteristics specific to rural areas. As part of the proposed Frugal 5G Network, we define a heterogeneous access network wherein macrocells provide carpet coverage, while wireless local area networks (WLANs) provide additional capacity to serve village clusters. WLAN is backhauled via a wireless network also called the wireless middle mile network. We define software defined networking and network function virtualization based architecture to make the network flexible and scalable. The concepts of fog computing have also been employed in the network architecture to bring intelligence to the edge (i.e., to the access network). The proposed network architecture is developed independent of 3GPP 5G standards and can serve as a potential solution toward IEEE P2061, a standardization project that aims to design an architecture to facilitate rural broadband communication.",

      "abstract": "Compared to previous mobile generations, the 5G system architecture offers more flexibility to fulfill a richer set of diverse requirements. Three system aspects play a major role here: support of network slicing, a split between the user plane and the control plane, and a service oriented control architecture. Emerging techniques of network softwarization such as software-defined networking are leveraged to provide this notion of flexibility manifested in a software-defined core network. However, in addition to the 5G core (5GC), analogous concepts could be applied to the next generation radio access network to sustain the required system performance. Driven by the increased attention that is currently paid to a software-defined radio access network, in this article, we propose the radio access network control function (RANCF) as an additional 5G control function. We define the main functionalities of RANCF, and propose interfaces and protocols for the interaction with 5GC functions. Exploiting network slicing as an example, we demonstrate how RANCF facilitates the slice selection and slice management procedure.",

Similarly, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is another key technology to fulfill the stringent requirements of 5G to offer anytime-anywhere connected services for massive numbers of devices with ultra-low delay and very large bandwidths. The amalgamation of the ICN paradigm with MEC opens up new opportunities as well some challenges to realize 5G vision and advance beyond 5G systems.

      "abstract": "MCC is essential for public safety, service efficiency improvement, and economic growth sustainability. MCC services demand an extremely fast response rate. On the other hand, the tremendous growth of IoT and AI are vital elements to allow MCC developments to flourish. In this article, CIoT is newly defined to include standards and facilitate emerging IoT solutions to be adopted for critical services. The service reliability in CIoT embraces IoT and AI, and measures resilience and availability of automation. Two important IoT standards, namely IEEE 1451 and IEEE P2668, are incorporated to standardize the performance of smart transducers and facilitate the evaluation of IoT maturity, respectively. In addition, an interworking solution of CIoT is designed to establish a heterogeneous network that comprises multiple IoT networks, such as 5G and LPWANs. The interworking solution renders the CIoT \"smart\" and enhances service resilience. Attention is drawn to the fact that most emerging IoT protocols do not comply with the low-latency requirement of MCC. In this article, a communication prioritization scheme incorporating CL and SL is proposed to overcome the highlighted challenge. Finally, the challenges and future development trends of CIoT are presented.",

      "abstract": "5G technology is expected to enable many innovative applications in different verticals. These applications have heterogeneous performance requirements (e.g., high data rate, low latency, high reliability, and high availability). In order to meet these requirements, 5G networks endorse network flexibility through the deployment of new emerging technologies, mainly network slicing and mobile edge computing. This article introduces a distributed blockchain-enabled network slicing (DBNS) framework that enables service and resource providers to dynamically lease resources to ensure high performance for their end-to-end services. The key component of our framework is the global service provisioning (GSP), which provides admission control for incoming service requests along with dynamic resource assignment by means of a blockchain-based bidding system. The goal is to improve users' experience with diverse services and reduce providers' capital and operational expenditures.",

The exploitation of data analytics services within the RAN itself, that is, to empower the operation of the RRM algorithms executed within the RAN nodes, is an incipient area of interest that broadens the more well-established applicability of using data analytics for on-top-of-the-RAN operations. In this respect, this article is an attempt to put a spotlight on this topic by motivating a plausible data analytics architectural framework for data-driven, smarter RRM algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Future generations of optical networks will require optical interfaces that operate beyond 1 Tb/s to keep up with the exploding worldwide Internet data capacity. The data converters, digital- to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC), significantly define the signal bandwidth that can be transmitted or received with an electro-optic transceiver. The foreseen improvements of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) data converters in upcoming CMOS technology nodes do not scale to the expected interface data rates for future communications systems. To address this bandwidth requirement, parallel data converter architectures (i.e., interleaved data converters) are an intriguing solution to enable performance beyond the limits imposed by continuing traditional CMOS approaches. In this article, we discuss the performance requirements for future data converters and provide an overview of the projected evolution of fiber optic networks and the limits imposed by CMOS-only data converters. Interleaved data converter architectures, in both the electrical and optical domains, are described and discussed. Finally, an outlook is given on the future development of next generation DAC and ADC architectures. This article is based on the presentations and discussions in the workshop \"Super DACs and ADCs -- To Interleave or Not to Interleave\" at the Optical Networking and Communication Conference 2019.",

      "abstract": "This article verifies the reliability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems on new synthesis methods based on deep neural networks. ASV systems are widely used and applied regarding secure and effective biometric authentication. On the other hand, the rapid deployment of ASV systems contributes to the increased attention of attackers with newer and more sophisticated spoofing methods. Until recently, speech synthesis of the reference speaker did not seriously compromise the latest ASV systems. This situation is changing with the deployment of deep neural networks into the synthesis process. Projects including WaveNet, Deep Voice, Voice Loop, and many others generate very natural and high-quality speech that may clone voice identity. We are slowly approaching an era where we will not be able to recognize a genuine voice from a synthesized one. Therefore, it is necessary to define the robustness of current ASV systems to new methods of voice cloning. In this article, well-known SVM and GMM as well as new CNN-based ASVs are applied and subjected to synthesized speech from Tacotron 2 with the WaveNet TTS system. The results of this work confirm our concerns regarding the reliability of ASV systems against synthesized speech.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented requirements of IoT have made fine-grained optimization of spectrum resources an urgent necessity. Thus, designing techniques able to extract knowledge from the spectrum in real time and select the optimal spectrum access strategy accordingly has become more important than ever. Moreover, 5G networks will require complex management schemes to deal with problems such as adaptive beam management and rate selection. Although deep learning (DL) has been successful in modeling complex phenomena, commercially available wireless devices are still very far from actually adopting learning-based techniques to optimize their spectrum usage. In this article, we first discuss the need for real-time DL at the physical layer, and then summarize the current state of the art and existing limitations. We conclude the article by discussing an agenda of research challenges and how DL can be applied to address crucial problems in 5G and beyond networks.",

      "abstract": "Disaggregated data centers (DCs) can offer high flexibility for resource allocation; hence, their resource utilization can be significantly improved. However, communications between different types of resources, in particular between CPU and memory, in fully disaggregated DCs face severe problems in terms of stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and ultra-high transmission bandwidth. Optical fiber communication is promising to provide high capacity and low latency, but it is still challenging for the state-of-the-art optical technologies to meet the requirements of fully disaggregated DCs. In this article, different levels of resource disaggregation are investigated. For fully disaggregated DCs, two architectural options are presented, where optical interconnects are necessary for the CPU-memory communications. We review the state-of-the-art optical transmission and switching technologies, and analyze pros and cons of their applicability in the disaggregated DCs. The results reveal that resource disaggregation does improve the resource utilization in DCs. However, the bandwidth provided by the state-of-the-art technologies is not always sufficient for fully disaggregated DCs. It calls for further advances in optical communications to fully utilize the advantages of fully disaggregated DCs.",

      "abstract": "Due to the openness of the transmission medium, it is necessary for radio systems to have anti-jamming abilities. Traditional anti-jamming methods such as sequence-based frequency hopping and direct sequence spread spectrum have shortcomings of low spectral efficiency and fixed communication patterns. With the development of software-defined radio, jamming devices are increasingly advanced and efficient. In this article, we propose a new paradigm for anti-jamming called DSAJ. With the help of cognitive radio and machine learning, the aim of DSAJ is to learn the dynamic and complex spectrum environment and obtain an optimal communication strategy. We first introduce the basic concept of anti-jamming communications and provide a brief summary of anti-jamming methods. Then, through a case study, mathematical modeling and applications of DSAJ are discussed for both single-user and multi-user systems. A real-life DSAJ testbed is described, and some potential research directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Future machine learning (ML) powered applications, such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, involve training and inference tasks with timeliness requirements and are communication- and computation-intensive, which demands the edge learning framework. The real-time requirements drive us to go beyond accuracy for ML. In this article, we introduce the concept of timely edge learning, aiming to achieve accurate training and inference while minimizing the communication and computation delay. We discuss key challenges and propose corresponding solutions from data, model, and resource management perspectives to meet the timeliness requirements. In particular, for edge training, we argue that the total training delay rather than rounds should be considered, and propose data or model compression, and joint device scheduling and resource management schemes for both centralized training and federated learning systems. For edge inference, we explore the dependency between accuracy and delay for communication and computation, and propose dynamic data compression and flexible pruning schemes. Two case studies show that the timeliness performance, including the training accuracy under a given delay budget and the completion ratio of inference tasks within deadline, are highly improved with the proposed solutions.",

      "abstract": "Existing static defenses for online service systems can be fragile and costly due to the continuity of ubiquitous cyber attacks. LAD has become a promising technology to tackle this problem. However, the security of the defense mechanism itself is often neglected as LAD mainly focuses on fortifying the protected target. This would allow a new deductive attack to encroach on LADs by inferring and undermining defense strategy, and then the whole defense mechanism can be completely invalidated once for all. Such a problem leads to the urgent need to develop new defense technologies with self-protection capability. In this article, we propose a new endogenous security defense mechanism named LSSM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a systematic defense structure with endogenous security to resist deductive attacks. We first review the existing learning-enhanced active defense mechanisms and compare their pros and cons. Then the methodology of LSSM is illustrated targeting two major threats posed by deductive attacks. Experimental results highlight the performance of our method. Finally, we conclude this article with a discussion of several future directions for LADs.",

      "abstract": "IoT is emerging as the future evolution of the Internet, aiming to provide connectivity for everyone and everything. Since IoT is expected to carry important and private information, a high level of PHY security is critical for wireless communications in IoT, as a complement for traditional security techniques that are employed at high layers. In this overview, we examine the recent interest in energy-efficient and cost-efficient PHY solutions for securing downlink IoT transmission through interference exploitation. This exciting line of research departs from conventional interference cancellation, and judiciously employs the inherent interference as a useful element for LUs while obstructing the eavesdropping of information. We first discuss the concept of CI, and then elaborate the fundamental CI signal design that employs the traditionally undesired interference as a constructive element to LUs while ensuring they are destructive to potential Eves. Subsequently, we illustrate several low-hardware-cost techniques to inherit the advantage of CI in an energy- and cost-efficient manner, from the perspective of HBF and DM. This family of techniques brings a disruptive vision of interference management for securing wireless communications with an eye on low-cost and hardware-constrained devices tailored for IoT systems.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by the breakthroughs of AI in both theory and applications, we are perceiving a great potential for network innovations from a new dimension of intelligence. However, as the engine of networks, switches are designed as \"dumb\" network elements with the sole purpose of forwarding network packets, and thus a barrier against the entrance of AI as an intrinsic part of the network is unconsciously erected. This article proposes an evolved switch architecture aimed at breaking this barrier and accommodating in-network intelligence. We enhance the current switch architecture by embedding an intelligence plane, which is externalized as an intelligent computation pluggable module of an evolved switch. The module employs an integrated solution of \"X86 CPU+GPU+DPDK,\" which provides a high-performance and high-throughput open platform for hosting in-network intelligence. We further conceive a flexible processing framework for an intelligent traffic measurement, recognition, and traffic regime. We also carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate the capability of the evolved switch by deploying a prototype in a campus network, with two promising application scenarios: in-network application identification and in-network anomaly detection.",

The availability of a large, contiguous bandwidth in the frequency band around 300 GHz creates the opportunity to seamlessly interconnect coherent THz-wireless and fiber optic transceiver frontends using a transparent, analog baseband interface. In this article, we discuss this concept in more detail and report on the recent demonstration of a real-time, short-range THz-wireless fiber extender with 100 Gb/s net capacity. This combined fiber optic/THz-wireless transmission system is operated by a high-speed fiber optic real-time modem, which is capable of compensating the channel impairments of both the optical and THz-wireless links. In addition, we discuss the potential of THz-wireless links to achieve long-range transmission distances by reporting on the operation of a 500-m-long line-of-sight THz-wireless outdoor link in Berlin, Germany. We analyze the effect of weather conditions on the transmission performance and determine the maximum physical layer net data rate of the system by means of various modulation formats and symbol rates. Finally, we summarize all of our recent high-capacity experiments using THz-wireless transmission, including a field trial with a 1-km-long link, and compare our results to theoretical limits and achieved data rates in the laboratory.",

Evolved 5G and 6G will need sophisticated AI to automate information delivery simultaneously for mass autonomy, human machine interfacing, and targeted healthcare. Trust will become increasingly critical for 6G as it manages a wide range of mission-critical services. As we migrate from traditional mathematical model-dependent optimization to data-dependent deep learning, the insight and trust we have in our optimization modules decrease. This loss of model explainability means we are vulnerable to malicious data, poor neural network design, and the loss of trust from stakeholders and the general public -- all with a range of legal implications. In this review, we outline the core methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in a wireless network setting, including public and legal motivations, definitions of explainability, performance vs. explainability trade-offs, and XAI algorithms.

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT is expected to offer a better quality of life and open up new business applications. However, the huge number of IoT devices are likely to create an immense burden on current wireless networks. Interestingly, next-generation 5G wireless networks envision the usage of mmWave frequencies for a manifold increase in data rates and user capacity. Nevertheless, the inherent LoS in mmWave communications raises significant new challenges in providing seamless coverage across the dense 5G networks. Emerging D2D communications are expected to offer a viable solution for this LoS challenge by providing relay services and extending the coverage. An NLoS device can use direct D2D communications for transmitting the data by using other LoS devices. The selection of relay requires maintaining a certain level of trust and privacy of the content. In this article, we explain that similar to human SN, personal trust among devices can be efficiently used to develop trustworthiness in D2D relay communications. By introducing a new distributed architecture for social relationships in D2D communications, we discuss and analyze new methods for a dynamic social relationship and trust management mechanism. Efficient and trustworthy social D2D relay networks significantly improve the capacity of mmWave 5G wireless networks. Simulation experiments corroborate our improvement in IoT device capacity and throughput. We also present coexistence of the proposed scheme with the existing state-of-the-art relay selection schemes.",

      "abstract": "Tactical edge networks are characterized by wireless links that have limited capacity and are prone to disconnection. In such a challenging and hostile environment, replication of information could be desirable as it increases information availability through redundancy and accessibility through proximity. However, replication of information has a negative effect on security because it broadens the attack surface - more nodes may be targeted to obtain sensitive information, thereby potentially increasing the overall risk of the information being compromised or leaked. Furthermore, replicating information takes away resources (particularly communications and power, but also to some extent computation and storage) from other tasks that might also need the same resources. These trade-offs between information availability, information protection, and resource utilization exist and need to be explored in the context of different solutions that could be applied to the challenging problem of information dispersal for assured operations in tactical environments.",

Federated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT-based smart applications. In this article, we present the primary design aspects for enabling federated learning at the network edge. We model the incentive- based interaction between a global server and participating devices for federated learning via a Stackelberg game to motivate the participation of the devices in the federated learning process. We present several open research challenges with their possible solutions. Finally, we provide an outlook on future research.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the wireless communications community to complement the traditional model-driven design approaches with data-driven machine learning (ML)-based solutions. While conventional ML approaches rely on the assumption of having the data and processing heads in a central entity, this is not always feasible in wireless communications applications because of the inaccessibility of private data and large communication overhead required to transmit raw data to central ML processors. As a result, decentralized ML approaches that keep the data where it is generated are much more appealing. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, federated learning is particularly relevant for many wireless applications, especially in the context of fifth generation (5G) networks. In this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the general idea of federated learning, discuss several possible applications in 5G networks, and describe key technical challenges and open problems for future research on federated learning in the context of wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "Emerging edge computing has seen latency- sensitive services moving rapidly from cloud to the edge to take advantage of its close vicinity to end users, while cloud is retained for carrying out latency-insensitive and computation-intensive tasks. When more edge computing service providers come to the market, the network will become increasingly more fragmented because of their proprietary services and policies deployed in the network. This means that the Internet can become more cumbersome and riskier as there will be more tiers and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited. To tackle this issue, we envisage a federated service chaining paradigm in which operators can share and put service functions in other participants' networks so as to improve resource utilization, collaboratively mitigate cyber threats, and enable service innovations. In this position article, building on our past experience in enabling federated cloud infrastructure and heterogeneous service chaining, we present a Federated Service Chaining architecture followed by discussions of its key components. Several key research challenges are described for the successful realization of such architecture. We hope this article can open a discussion in the research community and generate enough research interest to significantly advance this field.",

Phase and time-of-day synchronization will be necessary in the future. Thus, network operators are searching for efficient and reliable synchronization architectures. In this article, an example of such an architecture, applicable to fifth generation mobile networks, is presented, based on the requirements published in the latest ITU-T Recommendations. For supervision of the performance of the synchronization network, the technology of optical time transfer (OTT) is proposed, which allows dissemination of an accurate timescale such as a UTC realization to selected nodes of a coherent network primary reference time clock. The OTT realized so far and its current and future role in the network of Deutsche Telekom are discussed, and representative measurement results are shown.",

      "abstract": "By natively supporting in-network caching and name-based forwarding, ICN brings in features that are relevant to better support data transmission in opportunistic wireless networks. Such environments are highly challenged because of the node mobility and intermittent contacts. Therefore, forwarding packets to the right node at the right moment is critical to data retrieval performance. This article proposes a novel ICN forwarding strategy that leverages notable metrics, such as centrality and reliability, and the optimal stopping theory to statistically select the best next-hop forwarders and the time to perform the forwarding decision. Simulations with realistic mobility traces show that the proposed forwarding strategy outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions by guaranteeing shorter retrieval time and less overhead in terms of packet replicas.",

Using the Internet of Things (IoT) at the core of a design-based methodology, multiple implementations of IoT-oriented educational scenarios (ESs) were realized in different educational contexts. More than 150 secondary students and nine teachers, in seven different settings, were involved in an integrated educational framework with hands-on activities and teamwork. Using a concrete evaluation methodology exploiting both quantitative and qualitative data collected before, during, and after the interventions, we analyze the students' and teachers' experience to understand critical parameters and provide directions for successful ESs. Our findings show that the IoTbased ES realizations were successful overall and enhanced STEM career awareness and skills, with boys showing greater appreciation than girls. Different ES timeframes resulted in different conclusions, while proper organization and preparation in all aspects involved in the realization are critical.",

      "abstract": "The networking community continues to create new technologies and update existing ones to improve the quality, reliability, and \"tailorability\" of data networks. However, whenever Internet service providers attempt to productize \"tailorability\" and sell it explicitly to end customers as a premium service over best effort connectivity, they either fail to overcome net neutrality concerns or struggle to gain market traction. For this article, we focus only on those networking protocols, technologies, or standards whose goal is to offer tailored connectivity to paying customers on a public network and refer to them as differentiated QoS (D-QoS) standards. This article makes two contributions to the understanding of the goals of D-QoS standards. First, it explores their techno-economic market trajectory to understand the factors that determine success. In doing this, we acknowledge that while there is wide variation and dissimilarity in their underlying technical properties, the expectation and goal for all D-QoS standards is that they will be used to provide guaranteed connection for which customers could be prepared to pay. As such, we consider Layer 2/3 technologies (e.g., ATM, frame relay, MPLS), signaling technologies (e.g., RSVP), data packet markers (e.g., IP ToS, DiffServ, WME, QCI), and end-to-end separation solutions (e.g., leased lines, network slicing) as a single cohort and analyze them together. Second, by exploring the parallels with 5G network slicing, we argue that despite its inherent technical differences with other D-QoS standards, the commercial performance of network slicing may end up resembling that of previous D-QoS standards. Consequently, we seek to learn lessons from previous D-QoS attempts and suggest that enterprise-focused 5G slices, running within a single service provider's domain and with binding service level agreements, will have the highest chance of success in the short/medium term.",

Significant research efforts have been made to meet the low latency and high bandwidth requirements set forward by interactive applications such as remote surgery and virtual reality. Recent research made six degrees of freedom (6DoF) for immersive media possible, where users may both move their head and change their position within a scene. In this article, we present the status and challenges of 6DoF applications based on volumetric media, focusing on the key aspects required to deliver such services. Furthermore, we present results from a subjective study to highlight relevant directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) tasks are becoming ubiquitous in today's network applications. Federated learning has emerged recently as a technique for training ML models at the network edge by leveraging processing capabilities across the nodes that collect the data. There are several challenges with employing conventional federated learning in contemporary networks, due to the significant heterogeneity in compute and communication capabilities that exist across devices. To address this, we advocate a new learning paradigm called fog learning, which will intelligently distribute ML model training across the continuum of nodes from edge devices to cloud servers. Fog learning enhances federated learning along three major dimensions: network, heterogeneity, and proximity. It considers a multi-layer hybrid learning framework consisting of heterogeneous devices with various proximities. It accounts for the topology structures of the local networks among the heterogeneous nodes at each network layer, orchestrating them for collaborative/cooperative learning through device-to-device communications. This migrates from star network topologies used for parameter transfers in federated learning to more distributed topologies at scale. We discuss several open research directions toward realizing fog learning.",

Across various indoor and outdoor PLC application scenarios, the electromagnetic compatibility restrictions and the low-pass nature of power line channels restrict the data rate gains that can be furthered by conventional means of increasing power and/ or bandwidth. In this article, we provide an overview of IBFD operation as a means to improve PLC under these constraints, by potentially doubling the spectral efficiency through simultaneous signal transmission and reception in the same frequency band and over the same power line. We summarize the recent advancements in IBFD solutions for both narrowband and broadband PLC and contrast the design considerations to those in existing IBFD methods in other communications systems. We also highlight the benefits of IBFD operation to PLC networks in easing PLC network congestion, ensuring electromagnetic compatibility of PLC across application scenarios, and obtaining added insights in the context of smartgrid monitoring and security using simultaneous bidirectional communication.",

At present, mainstream solutions are implemented by software, and the delay introduced is longer; others implemented by hardware do not achieve excellent performance. This article proposes an implementation scheme of a reconfigurable load balancing engine on an FPGA. This engine could distribute network packets to CPU cores over a five-tuple, and the delay brought by balancing algorithm is only about 26 ns. Furthermore, this engine can process all frame sizes of packets at 100 percent line rate and zero packet loss rate, achieving excellent performance. At the same time, this engine supports dynamic configuration and can be set flexibly according to different scenarios.",

      "abstract": "There are a large number of vertical industries implementing multiple use cases, each use case characterized by diverging service, network, and connectivity requirements -- including automobile, manufacturing, power grid, and others. Such heterogeneity cannot be effectively managed and efficiently mapped onto a single type of network slice instance (NSI). Thus, the tailored provisioning of an end-to-end network slicing solution to a vertical industry that consists of multiple use cases is a critical issue, which motivates this article, aimed at exploring this never-addressed and challenging research problem by proposing the use case-specific network slicing and sub-network slicing concepts that enable the provisioning of use case-specific NSI (US-NSI) and generic NSI (GN-NSI), respectively. Both approaches tackle the same technical issue of provisioning, management, and orchestration of per-vertical per-use-case NSIs in order to improve resource allocation and enhance network performance. The article also presents the architectural frameworks for managing US-NSI and GN-NSI, which extend the service deployment concept and system architecture of network slicing for vertical customers of 5G mobile networks.",

To mitigate these attacks, multiple types of network security equipment are used in combination, requiring considerable security knowledge of each type of network security equipment. Also, the deployment of network security equipment requires considerable cost and time. To solve these problems, this article proposes an IBCS based on automation and virtualization. IBCS provides not only an automated, virtualized security system for security service providers, but also easy, quick, and flexible cloud-based security services for security service consumers based on their intents. Finally, this article demonstrates the feasibility of IBCS with a prototype in a real network environments.",

      "abstract": "With the ratification of the IEEE 802.15.3d amendment to 802.15.3, a first step has been made to standardize consumer wireless communications in the sub-THz frequency band. IEEE 802.15.3d offers switched point-to-point connectivity with data rates of 100 Gb/s and higher at distances ranging from tens of centimeters up to a few hundred meters. In this article, we provide a detailed introduction to IEEE 802.15.3d and the key design principles beyond the developed standard. We particularly describe the target applications and usage scenarios, as well as the specifics of the IEEE 802.15.3d physical and medium access layers. Later, we present the results of the initial performance evaluation of IEEE 802.15.3d wireless communications. The obtained first-order performance predictions show non-incremental benefits compared to the characteristics of the fifth generation wireless systems, thus paving the way toward the sixth generation THz networks. We conclude the article by outlining the further standardization and regulatory activities on wireless networking in the THz frequency band.",

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is certainly one of the most active SDOs operating in this broad domain. With the aim of building a comprehensive, interoperable, and streamlined IoT stack, several IETF working groups are developing protocols in multiple technological domains, which are already very relevant to IoT.

      "abstract": "With the ever increasing requirements for ultra efficiency, advanced technologies such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have been considered. By offering more flexility of antenna deployment, a distributed setup of a massive MIMO system can benefit from considerable efficiency improvement over the colocated counterpart. However, distributed massive MIMO antennas will result in design and implementation challenges regarding synchronization, calibration, real-time baseband processing, and so on. Thus, equipped with general-purpose processors, we propose a cloud-based cell-free distributed massive MIMO system, which can not only archive 5G NR requirements but also easily be extended to different application scales. As an illustrative example, a 128 x 128 distributed MU-MIMO system with frequency 100 MHz@3.5 GHz is given. Test results show that 10.185 Gb/s throughput and more than 100 b/s/Hz spectrum utilization can be obtained. Flexibly scaling to the target deployment density, this system can support various applications on cross-industry collaboration.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the recent investigations on improving modulation designs for visible light communication (VLC) systems subject to signal-dependent noise (SDN). The existence of signal-dependent noise degrades the system performance and leads to modulation deficiency issues due to the constellation distortion caused by the SDN. For single-carrier systems, a joint constellation and threshold design was recently proposed to compensate the SDN, and it is re-analyzed in this article together with an improved design criterion based on the rotated minimum Euclidean distance (MIN-ED) that was employed to enhance modulation efficiency in multi-carrier systems. These design criteria are further ameliorated by optimizing the distance-range. Performance comparisons between improved and MIN-ED-based designs for VLC-SDN systems under communications and lighting constraints are also presented to illustrate the major limitations of current modulations. This article concludes with critical implementation challenges and future research opportunities.",

      "abstract": "IAB is being considered as a means to reduce the deployment costs of ultra-dense 5G mmWave networks, using wireless backhaul links to relay the access traffic. In this work we describe the most recent standardization activities on IAB, and compare architectures with and without IAB in mmWave deployments. While it is well understood that IAB networks reduce deployment costs by obviating the need to provide wired backhaul to each cellular base station, it is still necessary to validate the IAB performance in realistic scenarios. In this article we demonstrate the cell edge throughput advantage offered by IAB using end-to-end system-level simulations. We also highlight some research challenges for IAB that will require further investigations.",

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence is expected to enhance the cognizance and intelligence of edge computing, resulting in a new paradigm, intelligent edge computing. However, as is evident, several new security and privacy-related issues will arise due to the distinct characteristics and working principles of intelligent edge computing. In this article, we focus on malicious attacks targeting the intelligent engines of edge computing. These attacks counteract the gains from intelligent systems and also compromise the edge computing system. We provide the main factors that are responsible for the security and privacy-related challenges in intelligent edge computing. Finally, the potential research directions in privacy and security-related issues are outlined for intelligent edge computing.",

      "abstract": "As the 5G pace is quickening, enabled by rapid coverage rollout and availability of devices, the fixed broadband market is poised to become more competitive. We envision that 5G NS can emerge as a game changer that accelerates the development of FMC while counterintuitively opening up opportunities for fixed operators and the like in need of higher access network capability by leveraging NS-assisted FMC. In this article, we present an architectural framework to foster cross-industry infrastructure collaboration from a RAN slicing perspective with the aim of reducing network costs and improving rollout efficiency in the broadband ecosystem. Under this framework, RAN slicing can turn wireless access into an anchor service offering that can be exploited by not only existing mobile operators with licensed spectrum, but by a host of slice tenants including fixed wireless access startups, digital subscriber line operators, and converged operators. In the latter instances, independent RAN slices can be instantiated and granularly scaled to support these tenants who may not own mobile infrastructure or spectrum, while maximizing reuse of their live networks. Following a discussion on the market drivers and rationales for RAN slicing, we outline some RAN slicing options for different operators to realize resource isolation and allocation. Furthermore, a big data-driven, artificial-intelligence- powered RAN slicing and resource management framework is introduced for enabling RAN automation. Finally, several future challenges are identified.",

Resource management of data center networks (DCNs) is critical to the performance of cloud computing. Due to the large-scale, distributed, and cross-regional characteristics of DCNs, there is insufficient resource utilization. In this article, we discuss the latest developments in the resource management and optimization of DCNs. We also designed an intelligent resource search algorithm to efficiently search excellent resources in massive computing resources. We propose a novel intelligent resource scheduling based on the locality principle algorithm (RSLP). The proposed strategy can search computing resources dynamically and efficiently, and allocate large resources to large tasks efficiently. Furthermore, we outline critical demands and guidance for researchers and designers to achieve the convergence of artificial intelligence and data centers.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of interconnected devices for exchanging information through sensors and actuators. One of the main physical sensors to understand the environment beyond the visible world is a radar. Basically, radars have always been a military tool to investigate the environment. However, with the developing technology, radars have become more compact and affordable to use in a building, in a car, in a drone, or even in a wristwatch. In the near future, radar-equipped IoT platforms will start to appear increasingly. For each IoT platform, dual use of spectrum with dual aperture is required for sensing and communicating when using conventional approaches. Emissions from the radar and communication circuitries are the main causes of the increase in energy consumption for any radar sensing IoT device. Furthermore, an increasing number of radars cause congested spectrum, and RF convergence between radar and communication systems becomes more likely to present itself. In recent years, numerous research works have proposed using the single waveform for perceiving the environment and sending information. They are often called \"joint radar-communication' (JRC) systems. As a result of the latest advancements in JRC system designs, radar sensing IoT platforms now can be transformed into an \"Internet of Radars\" (IoR). This article is an attempt to introduce a prospective research direction in order to develop the architectures necessary to make the IoR concept possible. In this article, we present a short survey of JRC technologies likely to be used on radar-sensing-capable IoT devices. Then possible application areas, challenges to enable JRC, and future research perspectives are proposed.",

      "abstract": "With the rapidly growing bandwidth demand for wireless applications, new system technologies related to post-5G are emerging. In this article, an all-spectra fully adaptive and coordinated radio access network (RAN) is reported and discussed. By employing a fiber-wireless integration and networking architecture, all data-carrying channels could be aggregated in the same fiber access infrastructure. This enables a coordinated RAN with function decoupling, in which lower RF, 5G New Radio (NR), sub-THz, and even lightwave are employed; also, different types of services are delivered depending on their physical layer properties. Promising scenarios are discussed, such as integrated access of wireless NR-free space optical (FSO) backhauling and indoor systems via visible light communication (VLC) and efficient NR beamforming aided by VLC positioning system. The former use case can enhance the network throughput and reliability. This is because both FSO and NR can support high channel capacity due to their abundant bandwidth. Meanwhile, with the advancement of novel DSP techniques, the stability of the NR-FSO link under diverse weather turbulences or suffering from burst mode interference can be enhanced. The latter scenario provides an alternative solution for high-speed data link and a simplified beam management via the VLC-aided positioning system. VLC can concurrently provide ubiquitous indoor illumination, data transmission, and positioning. With the help of artificial intelligence algorithms, a VLC-based precision positioning system can provide a location accuracy of less than 1 cm, and it is able to meet the narrow beam size of the NR beamformer in a 3D model. Therefore, it is foreseeable that an all-spectra function decoupled RAN can serve as a unified network platform to support all wireless applications while optimizing system throughput, channel condition, network coverage, and software/ hardware complexity for post-5G mobile data networks.",

However, new demands to \"program\" virtual networks at a finer granularity have arisen as tenants want the ability to provision and control switches and links in their virtual networks. This study proposes a new concept called the p-NIaaS model. The p-NIaaS model enables tenants to program their own packet processing logic and monitor network status from any virtual network infrastructure, which is not possible with current network virtualization. This article presents the Libera network hypervisor that implements the p-NIaaS model. Libera overcomes the shortcomings of existing network hypervisors such as scalability, VM migration support, and flexibility. The evaluation shows that the Libera hypervisor is highly scalable and effectively supports VM migration. We also present the overheads of Libera. Libera incurs up to 11 percent overhead in comparison with a non-virtualized network, which we believe is promising in the first prototype of the p-NIaaS model.",

      "abstract": "The MEC paradigm calls for a distribution of computational capacity at the network's edges. While MEC will play a key role in future 5G deployments, it will take some time until the existing 4G networks evolve into a full 5G system. A challenge exists to devise a transition mechanism that allows MEC features to be seamlessly integrated in the current 4G networks. This article introduces a lightweight, ETSI-compliant MEC solution for 4G and 5G networks. The proposed solution, which we name LightEdge, has the main goal of immediately making available the features and capabilities of edge clouds to mobile users. This article reports on the design and implementation of LightEdge and on its evaluation in a practical latency-sensitive use case.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing and network slicing might be considered as the main pillars of the upcoming 5G systems as they inject flexibility into the network management operations. While one prominent architectural framework for edge computing has been recently defined by the ETSI standard organization, namely multi-access edge computing (MEC), network slicing has reached its momentum by fostering interest in different standardization bodies and fora. To better understand how such distinct network slicing definitions impact the standardized MEC framework, ETSI has recently published a study on the matter. In this article, we first overview with a comprehensive analysis the different network slicing concepts and their relationship. Then we elaborate on the ETSI study to provide an integrated view of network slicing technology within the context of MEC. Finally, we report on the open challenges in the ETSI study and propose two solutions to evolve the current MEC framework toward end-to-end multi-slice support and efficient multi-tenant inter-slice communication in 5G deployments.",

      "abstract": "Network slicing is set out to address crucial needs of 5G, including support for multi-service provisioning. Focusing on resource and performance isolation, as well as security concerns associated with multi-tenancy, existing management and orchestration (MANO) frameworks typically offer network slices in the form of isolated bundles of computing, storage, and network resources across the network infrastructure, including the edge. However, network slice instantiation in its prevailing form raises significant concerns related to performance and resource utilization, hindering potential business-to-business (B2B) synergies. In this article, we discuss a new aspect of network slicing, optimized cross-slice communication (CSC). We argue that multi-tenancy and service co-location open up unique opportunities for B2B interactions, inter-service communications, and service composition, especially in the domain of edge computing and location-based services. In this context, we present optimized edge slice orchestration (MESON), a MANO-based architecture for optimized CSC in edge clouds. We discuss the main architecture components and descriptors, as well as the steps required for the discovery of CSC-enabled services and the establishment of optimized CSC among co-located slices.",

      "abstract": "To build the mechanism of a SelfDN is becoming an emerging direction for future IoT. The detection of device status, such as fault or normal, is a very fundamental module in SelfDN. In this article, we first review recent studies devoted to applying fault detection techniques in IoT networks. Taking the challenge of processing the real-valued IoT data into account, we propose a novel fault detection architecture for SelfDN. Under this architecture, we present an algorithm, named GBRBM-based deep neural network with auto-encoder (i.e., GBRBM-DAE) to transform the fault detection problem into a classification problem. The real-world trace-driven experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other popular machine learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, pure deep neural network, and so on. Finally, we summarize some open issues of this study. We expect that this article will inspire successive studies on the related topics of SelfDN.",

      "abstract": "End-to-end congestion control has been extensively studied for over 30 years as one of the most important mechanisms to ensure efficient and fair sharing of network resources among users. As future networks are becoming more and more complex, conventional rule-based congestion control approaches tend to become inefficient and even ineffective. Inspired by the great success that machine learning (ML) has achieved in addressing large-scale and complex problems, researchers have begun to shift their attention from the rule-based method to an ML-based approach. This article presents a selected review of the recent applications of ML to the field of end-to-end congestion control. In this survey, we start with a brief review of the relationship between congestion control and ML. We then review the recent works that apply ML to congestion control. These works either help the agent to make an intelligent congestion control decision or achieve enhanced performance. Finally, we highlight a series of realistic challenges and shed light on potential future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, the uplink and downlink in a cellular network are associated with the same base station and the same frequency band since it promotes simpler network design, maintenance, and operation because of reduced complexity. However, when deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, network coverage has limitations hinging on the nature of the mmWave propagation characteristics relative to the traditional sub 6 GHz frequency bands. In this article, we present a method for an extension of the mmWave downlink coverage by demonstrating the benefits of decoupling the reverse and forward link frequencies and by leveraging macro-type radio deployment heights to maximize the line-of-sight coverage. The accompanying link budget analysis and coverage simulations quantify the benefit of the coverage extension methodology to be as much as 6.8 dB while extending possible coverage range distance to greater than 2 km.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields, from image classification to speech recognition. However, such models are trained with a large amount of sensitive training data, and are typically computationally expensive to build. As a result, many cloud providers (e.g., Google) have launched machine-learning-as-a-service, which helps clients benefit from the sophisticated cloud-based machine learning models via accessing public APIs. Such a business paradigm significantly expedites and simplifies the development circles. Unfortunately, the commercial value of such cloud-based machine learning models motivates attackers to conduct model extraction attacks for free use or as a springboard to conduct other attacks (e.g., craft adversarial examples in black-box settings). In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of existing approaches to model extraction attacks and defenses on cloud-based models. We classify the state-of-the-art attack schemes into two categories based on whether the attacker aims to steal the property (i.e., parameters, hyperparameters, and architecture) or the functionality of the model. We also categorize defending schemes into two groups based on whether the scheme relies on output disturbance or query observation. We not only present a detailed survey of each method, but also demonstrate the comparison of both attack and defense approaches via experiments. We highlight several future directions in both model extraction attacks and its defenses, which shed light on possible avenues for further studies.",

      "abstract": "RF fingerprinting involves identifying characteristic transmitter-imposed variations within a wireless signal. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that do not rely on handcrafting features have proven to be remarkably effective in fingerprinting tasks, as long as the channel remains invariant. However, DNNs trained at a specific location and time perform poorly on datasets collected under different channel conditions. This article proposes a data augmentation step within the training pipeline that exposes the DNN to many simulated channel and noise variations that are not present in the original dataset. We describe two approaches for data augmentation. The first approach is applied to the \"transmitter data\" when transmitter side data (i.e., pure signals without channel distortion) is available. The second approach is applied to the \"receiver data\" when only a passive dataset is available with already over-the-air transmitted signals. We show that data augmentation results in 75 percent improvement in the former case with a custom-generated dataset, and around 32-51 percent improvement in the latter case on a 5000-device WiFi dataset, compared to the case of non-augmented data fed to DNNs.",

      "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a key technology for 5G systems and offers cloud computing capabilities to application developers and content providers along with an information technology service environment at the edge of the network. In terms of system deployment, MEC infrastructure may, among other options, exist either at the edge of the radio access network (RAN), or at a \"smart\" central office (CO). Moreover, various MEC service consumption variants can be considered, depending on the degree of proximity between service consumers (i.e., MEC applications) and service producers (i.e., running on MEC platforms or exposed by service-producing MEC applications). Consequently, different system scenarios are expected to achieve different performance, e.g., in terms of the round-trip time (RTT) experienced at the user side. In this article, we present a first MEC performance case study to focus on different system deployments and service consumption localities for a number of workloads. It is observed that in all cases, the RTT is highly impacted by the MEC application workload; higher RTT is observed when a MEC application consumes remote MEC services; whereas low RTT gain is observed when moving from smart CO to RAN edge deployments, regardless of the considered workload.",

      "abstract": "The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents important challenges for future radio networks. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which allows the network to support more than one user per orthogonal resource element, was recently proposed as a promising solution that can ultimately support the daunting requirements of such networks including massive connectivity, high spectral efficiency, and low latency. Nevertheless, numerous ultra-high-reliability applications of IoT present environments that are hampered by impulsive electromagnetic interference, referred to as impulsive noise. Such noise is known to cause degradation to the overall system performance. Moreover, given the non-orthogonal multiplexing in NOMA, such noise is expected to have a relatively more pronounced impact on the system performance. Therefore, this article sheds light on the performance degradation and mitigation of impulsive noise in the context of NOMA-based IoT networks. It proposes a multistage nonlinear processing approach specifically designed for OFDM-based PDM-NOMA systems. To obtain the optimum threshold of the corresponding users, we propose a deep learning approach to estimate the impulsive noise parameters from the received OFDM symbol. This information can consequently be used to evaluate the corresponding optimal threshold using Siegert's ideal observer criterion. Finally, this work sheds light on potential opportunities and challenges that are expected to arise during the implementation of NOMA in impulsive environments.",

Since its introduction in 3GPP Release 13, NB-IoT has in a few years achieved a remarkable market presence and is currently providing coverage in close to 100 networks. To further extend the reach of NB-IoT and to connect the unconnected, 3GPP Release 17 is studying the feasibility of adapting NB-IoT to support non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). In this article, we review the fundamentals of NB-IoT and NTN, and explain how NB-IoT can be adapted to support satellite communication through a minimal set of modifications.",

Originally targeting the evolution from 2G to 3G, 3GPP continues at the forefront of the standardization effort leading to 5G and beyond. Given the growing diversity of services and the explosion of mobile users year by year, evolving architectures have been successively proposed by the group in order to expand the limits of legacy systems. We overview this evolution, summarizing the transformation of core systems and their related decomposition, aggregation, and mapping operations from 3G to 5G systems. We also present an in-depth description of 5G Core based on recent technical documents delivered by 3GPP.

      "abstract": "Network slicing is an emerging paradigm in mobile networks that leverages NFV to enable the instantiation of multiple virtual networks - named slices - over the same physical network infrastructure. The operator can allocate to each slice dedicated resources and customized functions that allow meeting the highly heterogeneous and stringent requirements of modern mobile services. Managing functions and resources under network slicing is a challenging task that requires making efficient decisions at all network levels, in some cases even in real time, which can be achieved by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in the network. We outline a general framework for AI-based network slice management, introducing AI in the different phases of the slice life cycle, from admission control to dynamic resource allocation in the network core and at the radio access. A sensible use of AI for network slicing results in strong benefits for the operator, with expected performance gains between 25 and 80 percent in representative case studies.",

      "abstract": "Terahertz (THz)-band communications are celebrated as a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless systems that promises to integrate a wide range of data-demanding and delay-sensitive applications. Following recent advancements in optical, electronic, and plasmonic transceiver design, integrated, adaptive, and efficient THz systems are no longer far-fetched. In this article, we present a progressive vision of how the traditional \"THz gap\" will transform into a \"THz rush\" over the next few years. We posit that the breakthrough the THz band will introduce will not be solely driven by achievable high data rates, but more profoundly by the interaction between THz sensing, imaging, and localization applications. We first detail the peculiarities of each of these applications at the THz band. Then we illustrate how their coalescence results in enhanced environment-aware system performance in beyond-5G use cases. We further discuss the implementation aspects of this merging of applications in the context of shared and dedicated resource allocation, highlighting the role of machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Distributed ML at the network edge is a promising paradigm that can preserve both network bandwidth and privacy of data providers. However, heterogeneity and limited computation and communication resources on edge servers (or edges) pose great challenges on distributed ML and formulate a new paradigm of edge learning (i.e., edge-cloud collaborative machine learning). In this article, we propose a novel framework of \"learning to learn\" for effective EL on heterogeneous edges with resource constraints. We first model the dynamic determination of collaboration strategy (i.e., the allocation of local iterations at edge servers and global aggregations on the cloud during the collaborative learning process) as an online optimization problem to achieve the trade-off between the performance of EL and the resource consumption of edge servers. Then we propose an OL4EL framework based on the budget-limited multi-armed bandit model. OL4EL supports both synchronous and asynchronous learning patterns, and can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. To evaluate the performance of OL4EL, we conducted both real-world testbed experiments and extensive simulations based on Docker containers, where both support vector machine and K-means were considered as use cases. Experimental results demonstrate that OL4EL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EL and other collaborative ML approaches in terms of the trade-off between learning performance and resource consumption.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) undergoes a rapid transformation this last decade, thanks to the appearance of low-power wide area network technologies, such as LoRa/LoRaWAN, SigFox, and narrowband IoT, which allow reducing the deployment cost of sensors and other IoT devices. Many emerging services such as smart city, Industry 4.0, and autonomous driving are based on IoT devices and applications to collect and analyze data and control end devices (i.e., actuators). Among these services, several IoT applications, such as data analytics, need to be deployed at the edge to either reduce the latency to access data or treat the high amount of generated data locally. However, in the context of LoRa/LoRaWAN, most of the current IoT service deployments run the applications at a central cloud to ease the integration with existing software as a service (SaaS) platforms, without exploiting the benefits of edge computing. In this article, we propose a new framework that leverages the ETSI multi-access edge computing (MEC) model to deploy LoRabased IoT applications at the edge. In particular, the proposed model takes advantage of the ETSI MEC features, such as dynamic deployment of an IoT application at the edge and application life cycle management. In addition, the proposed framework allows running an IoT application as a 5G network slice at the edge.",

      "abstract": "The highly dynamic wireless communication environment poses a challenge for many applications (e.g., adaptive multimedia streaming services). Providing accurate TP can significantly improve performance of these applications. The scheduling algorithms in cellular networks consider various PHY metrics, (e.g., CQI) and throughput history when assigning resources for each user. This article explains how AI can be leveraged for accurate TP in cellular networks using PHY and application layer metrics. We present key architectural components and implementation options, illustrating their advantages and limitations. We also highlight key design choices and investigate their impact on prediction accuracy using real data. We believe this is the first study that examines the impact of integrating network-level data and applying a deep learning technique (on PHY and application data) for TP in cellular systems. Using video streaming as a use case, we illustrate how accurate TP improves the end user's QoE. Furthermore, we identify open questions and research challenges in the area of AI-driven TP. Finally, we report on lessons learned and provide conclusions that we believe will be useful to network practitioners seeking to apply AI.",

      "abstract": "The photonic on-chip network is an emerging technology that can provide low power and high bandwidth. However, photonic devices such as laser sources, resonators, and waveguides have high static power consumption, reducing the energy efficiency of the system. This article proposes a low-power optical network architecture. First, a dynamic network resource supply strategy is designed, and the optical network resources are adjusted according to the runtime traffic characteristics. Second, by leveraging power-efficient routers, our network architecture minimizes power used for compensating optical signal loss. Finally, an adaptive optical routing mechanism is designed to offer the lowest latency and power by utilizing existing network resources. The experimental results show that, compared to the existing scheme, our proposed architecture can save 51 percent power consumption and 60 percent energy consumption in the PARSEC and SPLASH-2 benchmark tests.",

These conflicting challenges are addressed in a system proposal dealing with both extremes. In contrast to most recent publications, focus is on the frequency domain below 10 GHz. Toward this goal, multi-mode antenna technology is used, and different realizations, offering up to eight uncorrelated ports per radiator element, are studied. Possible baseband architectures tailored to multimode antennas are discussed, enabling different options regarding precoding and beamforming.",

      "abstract": "With the prominent advancement of flight control and intelligent transportation technology, UAVs will play an important role in air traffic. Besides being deployed as dedicated aerial communication platforms, a large proportion of UAVs will be operated by different companies with various flight missions. In the existing literature, such UAVs are usually treated as consumers of spectrum resources. However, they may also bring opportunities of air-ground line-of-sight and relay links, which can improve the transmission optimization of ground networks. This article explores the opportunistic assistance of such UAVs for ground networks from a new perspective, called OUU. Various opportunistic transmission models and corresponding application scenarios are introduced according to different flight modes of UAVs, including opportunistic data dissemination, collection, caching, computing, and forwarding. Two preliminary cases demonstrate that effective OUU models can improve network performance without relying on dedicated deployment of aerial communication platforms, and thus alleviate the aerial traffic congestion issue. After discussing the challenges brought by large-scale and highly dynamic UAV networks, this article further enumerates the promising research directions and related optimization frameworks for the OUU model.",

      "abstract": "Due to the fast pace at which IoT is evolving, there is an increasing need to support over-theair software updates for security updates, bug fixes, and software extensions. To this end, multiple over-the-air techniques have been proposed, each covering a specific aspect of the update process, such as (partial) code updates, data dissemination, and security. However, each technique introduces overhead, especially in terms of energy consumption, thereby impacting the operational lifetime of the battery constrained devices. Until now, a comprehensive overview describing the different update steps and quantifying the impact of each step is missing in the scientific literature, making it hard to assess the overall feasibility of an over-the-air update. To remedy this, our article analyzes which parts of an IoT operating system are most updated after device deployment, proposes a step-by-step approach to integrate software updates in IoT solutions, and quantifies the energy cost of each of the involved steps. The results show that besides the obvious dissemination cost, other phases such as security also introduce a significant overhead. For instance, a typical firmware update requires 135.026 mJ, of which the main portions are data dissemination (63.11 percent) and encryption (5.29 percent). However, when modular updates are used instead, the energy cost (e.g., for a MAC update) is reduced to 26.743 mJ (48.69 percent for data dissemination and 26.47 percent for encryption).",

      "abstract": "Design flaws and unseen vulnerabilities in the photonic network-on-chip (PNoC) have made it a focal point of potential security attacks. Previous works well investigate remote attacks launched outside from electrical NoCs. However, it is still a challenge to find possible threats and efficient countermeasures for PNoCs. In PNoCs, for example, micro resonators can be maliciously controlled by a remote attacker to miss expected tuning function, thus leading to data loss and information disclosure. In this article, we first summarize remote denial of service attacks caused by hardware Trojan insertion and timing channel in NoCs. We then show that these two kinds of remote attacks are also effective threat models in PNoCs. We design, for the first time, countermeasures protecting against threat models in the hybrid wavelength and mode division multiplexing PNoC. Finally, we propose the challenging issues of enhancing the safety of the 3D PNoC under new potential threats.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the fast development of backbone networks has made the traffic, services, and infrastructure of packet-over-optical networks increasingly complicated. This stimulates research and development on fine-grained and real-time performance monitoring and troubleshooting. In this article, we propose a ProML-INT system to oversee packet-over-optical networks in real time and enable customized performance monitoring and troubleshooting. We introduce the system design in detail, and explain how to control the overhead of multilayer INT ML-INT by inserting INT fields in packets selectively. Experiments demonstrate the ProML-INT system, a small-scale packet-over-optical network testbed. The experimental results confirm that our proposal can monitor packet and optical layers jointly in real time, and the homemade data analyzer in it can leverage artificial intelligence to identify the root causes of exceptions in packet-over-optical networks correctly and promptly.",

      "abstract": "Fifth generation softwarized network systems will make it possible to flexibly partition the network infrastructure into logically independent network slices, hosting end-to-end network services able to dynamically meet the diverse requirements of vertical industries. However, the high dynamicity of NFV-related operations and the interdependence of multiple slices running on top of a shared underlying infrastructure pose peculiar security challenges. In this article we investigate how such challenges can be addressed in the context of the management and orchestration (MANO) security functions within the ETSI NFV architectural framework. In particular, we target access control and authorization functions, and we discuss how to advance them for network slicing deployments with continuous and closedloop usage control mechanisms. We also present a proof of concept of a MANO framework extended with UCON capabilities able to regulate the access and use of network slices according to customizable security policies. Preliminary performance evaluation proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach with minor impact on the user experience and prompt reaction time to security policy violations.",

To exploit this new technology, we propose a novel microwave quantum-enhanced backscattering system based on the laws of quantum physics. Both the transmitter and the receiver are quantum mechanical in nature and are accommodated at the infrastructure side, while the backscattering device is classical. The advocated system breaks the performance barrier of the classical backscattering systems and approaches the ultimate attainable receiver sensitivity. Finally, our quantum solution outperforms the classical solutions in terms of its level of security.",

      "abstract": "The search for physical layer technologies that can play a key role in beyond 5G systems has started. One option is reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can collect wireless signals from a transmitter and passively beamform them toward the receiver. The technology has exciting prospects and is quickly gaining traction in the communication community, but in the current hype we have witnessed how several myths and overstatements are spreading in the literature. In this article, we take a neutral look at the RIS technology. We first review the fundamentals and then explain specific features that can be easily misinterpreted. In particular, we debunk three myths: 1) current network technology can only control the transmitter and receiver, not the environment in between; 2) a better asymptotic array gain is achieved than with conventional beamforming; 3) the path loss is the same as with anomalous mirrors. To inspire further research, we conclude by identifying two critical questions that must be answered for RIS to become a successful technology: 1) What is a convincing use case for RIS?; 2) How can we estimate channels and control an RIS in real time?",

      "abstract": "The Internet is an essential tool for society as a whole, being the basis for several services. This importance has increased the requirements for Internet service providers (ISPs). The current Internet infrastructure is limited, which often compromises the quality of service and quality of experience of users. Therefore, ISPs need to evolve their technologies and management capacity. One key approach is network slicing, which allows the management of reliability and elastic resource demand. This article discusses the reliability requirements of the network slicing process as well as the features and challenges of elastic demand scenarios. Additionally, it presents a reliability strategy for network slicing. The results from the experiments performed, using a dataset with real network demands, suggest that the reliability strategy mitigates the impact of physical failures over the Internet access service.",

Rolf Landauer determined the lower limit for power dissipation in computation and noted that dissipation happens when information is lost, that is, when a bit is erased. This meant that with reversible computation, conserving information conserves energy as well, and as such can operate on arbitrarily small power. There were only a few applications and use cases of reversible computing hardware. Here, we present a novel reversible computation architecture for time reversal of waves, with an application to sound wave communications. This energy-efficient design is also a natural one, and it allows the use of the same hardware for transmission and reception at the time reversal mirror.",

      "abstract": "LPWAN technologies are playing a major role in the IoT scenario due to their extensive radio range, use of free frequency bands, and low energy consumption. Among these technologies, longrange WAN (LoRaWAN) transmits through several kilometers with data rates up to 5.5 kb/s, making it useful for applications such as smart city monitoring, precision agriculture, and environmental tracking. However, LoRaWAN supports only one-hop communication between end nodes and gateways. Because links can be kilometers long, LoRaWAN signals may encounter obstacles or interference, affecting packet reception. Therefore, different studies have proposed using routing schemes to create multihop communication and improve LoRaWAN performance. The article has the following contributions: first, we present the main approaches to build multihop communication in LoRa networks. Second, we summarize different routing protocols proposed for the technology. Finally, we describe different challenges to improve the performance of routing protocols for LoRaWAN.",

      "abstract": "With the introduction of diverse technology paradigms in next-generation cellular and vehicular networks, design and structural complexity are skyrocketing. The beyond-5G use cases such as mobile broadband, 5G-V2X, and UAV communications require support for ultra-low latency and high throughput and reliability with limited operational complexity and cost. These use cases are being explored in 3GPP Releases 16 and 17. To facilitate end-to-end performance evaluation for these applications, we propose SDN-Sim -- an integration of a system-level simulator (SLS) with a software defined network (SDN) infrastructure. While the SLS models the communication channel and evaluates system performance on the physical and data link layers, the SDN performs network and application tasks including routing, load balancing, and so on. The proposed architecture replicates the SLS-defined topology into an SDN emulator for offloading control operations. It uses link and node information calculated by the SLS to compute routes in SDN and feeds the results back to the SLS. Along with the architecture, data modeling, and processing, replication and route calculation frameworks are proposed.",

However, the ever exploding data volume and model complexity will limit centralized solutions to learn and respond within a reasonable time. Therefore, scalability becomes a critical issue to be solved. In this article, we aim to provide a systematic discussion of the building blocks of scalable data-driven wireless networks. On one hand, we discuss the forward-looking architecture and computing framework of scalable data-driven systems from a global perspective. On the other hand, we discuss relevant learning algorithms and model training strategies performed at each individual node from a local perspective. We also highlight several promising research directions in the context of scalable data-driven wireless communications to inspire future research.",

      "abstract": "Massive and diverse data is crucial to train a general deep learning model, while the data collection for model training is difficult, especially training on sensitive data (e.g., medical data and face imaging). The emerging collaborative learning addresses this issue well by allowing participants to train a global model by uploading a subset of parameter changes, instead of the entire training data, to a centralized server. However, this privacy-preserving method can effectively enable privacy protection only when the involving entities are trusted (i.e., they honestly follow the protocol). Otherwise, the method may still leak private data. In this article, we propose a secure collaborative learning system named SecCL, which leverages a trusted bulletin board built on blockchain to enable strong privacy protection in collaborative learning by ensuring authentic and correct message interaction during the training process. Also, we develop a novel smart contract for SecCL so that participants can achieve consensus to restrain malicious behaviors. Therefore, SecCL ensures that the server cannot deceive participants and that participants behave well during the training process. We implement a prototype to evaluate its performance, and the promising experimental results demonstrate that SecCL can throttle malicious behaviors of participants and parameter servers while ensuring the accuracy of the global model.",

      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly common for enterprises to outsource network functions to a third party provider such as a public cloud. Besides its well documented benefits in cost and flexibility, outsourcing also introduces security issues. Peeking into or modifying traffic destined to the cloud are not the only threats we have to deal with; it can also be desirable to protect VNF code, input policies, and states from a malicious cloud provider. In recent years several solutions have been proposed toward mitigating the threats of outsourcing VNFs, using either cryptographic or trusted hardware- based mechanisms (the latter typically applying SGX). In this article, we provide an overview of methods for protecting the security of outsourced network functions. We introduce the challenges and emerging requirements, analyze the state of the art, and identify the gaps between the requirements and existing solutions. Furthermore, we outline a potential way to fill these gaps in order to devise a more complete solution.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a disruptive technology that complements the usage of modern day information and communications technology (ICT) systems. IoT systems, with their small form and cost factor coupled with their increasing reliability, have made huge inroads in all markets. Connected to some form of interconnected networks, either to the mainstream Internet or private networks, they enable ubiquitous and to a large extent autonomous operation. This has taken away the idea that sensing, actuation, and computing needs to be dependent on expensive and complicated legacy systems. Although complete discontinuation of legacy systems is still quite a long journey and would not be completely possible, IoT systems show the waypoints as to how the ICT industry will evolve. The military domain is not far away from adopting IoT technologies in its operational construct. The NATO IST-147 and 176 research task groups have closely examined applicability of IoT for federated and ubiquitous military applications. Introducing IoT devices in the military domain requires verification and validation (V&amp;V) of ICT systems as per operational guidelines. This article proposes and applies a concept for security, privacy, and eependability evaluation of IoT systems that could be used for V&amp;V processes. This would enable more streamlined and standardized evaluations of IoT systems before they can be deemed usable for military contexts.",

Any enterprise can easily implement a wide array of network functions using NFV while maximizing efficiencies and introducing new revenue-generating services that are significantly faster and easier than ever before. NFV is a key enabler of the coming 5G infrastructure, supporting the virtualization of various appliances in the network. The scope of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the development of NFV-based services, media services in particular, and their specific requirements that are addressed in existing service development kits (SDKs). By supplying an overview of available tools, the development workflow of an example use case on immersive media is demonstrated with an SDK that provides a set of open source tools facilitating the development of media applications.",

      "abstract": "Neutral host SCPs represent a key element of the 5G vision of ultra-dense mobile networks. However, current business models mostly focus on multi-year agreements for large venues, such as stadiums and hotel chains. These business agreements are regulated through binding SLAs, which tend to be too cumbersome and costly for smaller-scale SCPs. As a result, the neutral host model does not scale up to its full potential. In this article, we propose a framework to enable the participation of small- to medium-sized players in the cellular market as providers offering network resources to MNOs. To this purpose, we review the current and emerging spectrum and technology opportunities that SCPs can use for neutral host deployments. We also propose the use of blockchain-enabled smart contracts as a simple and cost-efficient alternative to traditional SLAs for small-scale SCPs. To demonstrate this, we describe a proof of concept implementation of an Ethereum-based smart contract platform for best effort service between an SCP and an MNO.

      "abstract": "Despite the emerging network technologies such as 5G, edge computing, and cloud computing growing vigorously, it is difficult for terrestrial networks to provide quality services for IoV and other daily communications at the same time. With the advancement of satellite communication technology, more and more people are paying attention to the integration of satellite networks and ground networks. In this article, we propose a space-ground integrated information network based Internet of Vehicles (SGIIN-IoV) architecture supporting multilink access, which provides a good example for the application of the SGIIN in the IoV. In SGIIN-IoV, high delay-tolerant data will be transmitted through satellite links, avoiding using ultra low-latency links. Afterward, we propose a multilayer resource awareness (MLRA) mechanism to achieve full-dimensional monitoring in SGIIN-IoV, which consists of an intravehicle service layer, a link detection layer, and a global monitor layer. Further, we design an adaptive multilink data transmission (AMDT) mechanism to improve utilization of heterogeneous links in SGIIN-IoV. Finally, we verify the two mechanisms, MLRA and AMDT, and the results show that the proposed design can provide higher reliability for data transmission in time.",

      "abstract": "Billions of wireless devices are foreseen to participate in big data aggregation and smart automation in order to interface the cyber and physical worlds. Such large-scale ultra-dense wireless connectivity is vulnerable to malicious software (malware) epidemics. Malware worms can exploit multihop wireless connectivity to stealthily diffuse throughout the wireless network without being noticed by security servers at the core network. Compromised devices can then be used by adversaries to remotely launch cyber attacks that cause large-scale critical physical damage and threaten public safety. This article overviews the types, threats, and propagation models for malware epidemics in large-scale wireless networks (LSWNs). Then the article proposes a novel and cost-efficient countermeasure against malware epidemics in LSWNs, called spatial firewalls. It is shown that equipping a strategically selected small portion (i.e., less than 10 percent) of the devices with state-of-the-art security mechanisms is sufficient to create spatially secured zones that quarantine malware epidemics. Quarantined infected devices are then cured by on-demand localized software patching. To this end, several firewall deployment strategies are discussed and compared.",

      "abstract": "The advent of Industry 4.0 with massive connectivity places significant strains on the current spectrum resources, and challenges the industry and regulators to respond promptly with new disruptive spectrum management strategies. The envisioned spectrum intelligent radio has long been promised to unlock the full potential of spectrum resource. However, the current radio development, with certain elements of intelligence, is nowhere near showing an agile response to the complex radio environments. Following the line of intelligence, we propose to classify spectrum intelligent radio into three streams: classical signal processing, machine learning (ML), and contextual adaptation. We focus on the ML approach, and propose a new intelligent radio architecture with three hierarchical forms: perception, understanding, and reasoning. For each form, we propose some preliminary methods. The proposed perception method achieves fully blind multi-level spectrum sensing. The understanding method accurately predicts the primary users' coverage across a large area, and the reasoning method performs near-optimal idle channel selection. Opportunities, challenges, and future visions are also discussed for the realization of a fully intelligent radio.",

In particular, the Release-16 NR cellular interface and the NR sidelink interface are designed to enable platooning, advanced driving such as collision avoidance and cooperative lane change, extended sensors, and remote driving use cases. Compared to the LTE sidelink, the NR sidelink is equipped with a host of new capabilities including physical layer unicast and groupcast, reliable communication using feedback-based retransmissions, operation in millimeter-wave frequencies, advanced resource allocation, and quality of service management. In this article, we summarize the outcome of the related work carried out in 3GPP and discuss how the Release-16 NR capabilities can be used to provide advanced V2X services. We conclude by discussing next steps of the V2X service evolution and the NR sidelink capabilities.",

      "abstract": "The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has been widely used as an application of mobile ad hoc networking in the automotive industry. However, in the 5G/B5G era, the Internet of Things as a cutting-edge technology is gradually transforming the current Internet into a fully integrated future Internet. At the same time, it will promote the existing research fields to develop in new directions, such as smart home, smart community, smart health, and intelligent transportation. The VANET needs to accelerate the pace of technological transformation when it has to meet the application requirements of intelligent transportation systems, vehicle automatic control, and intelligent road information service. Based on this context, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has come into being, which aims to realize the information exchange between the vehicle and all entities that may be related to it. IoV's goals are to reduce accidents, ease traffic congestion, and provide other information services. At present, IoV has attracted much attention from academia and industry. In order to provide assistance to relevant research, this article designs a new network architecture for the future network with greater data throughput, lower latency, higher security, and massive connectivity. Furthermore, this article explores a comprehensive literature review of the basic information of IoV, including basic VANET technology, several network architectures, and typical application of IoV.",

      "abstract": "How well do upper millimeter-wave and terahertz frequency bands enable wireless communications? In this work, we approximate the current and estimate the future communication potential with emphasis on antenna and radio frequency hardware technologies, and radio propagation challenges. This is done by performing link budget evaluations with justified estimates of link budget calculus terms, such as the achievable or required noise figure, transmit power, and antenna gain. Estimates are based on current enabling technologies and needs to advance those. From the RF viewpoint, the bottlenecks are in generating sufficiently high transmit power and low noise with the support of very high antenna gains. As an example, we discuss opportunities around 300 GHz frequency. Challenges to support 100 Gb/s bit rate at 30 GHz bandwidth on 10 m link distance is analyzed for different kinds of devices.",

IoL improves the lighting efficiency and indoor lighting comfort level, and can support value-added information services by modulating the light intensity. However, further investigation of its impact on human beings is needed. This article first introduces the concept, the requirements, and the system structure of IoL using the Internet of Radio Light system as an example for information service. We investigate the feasibility of regulating human physiological rhythms, especially to alleviate degenerative neurological diseases. This would possibly bring light therapy treatments to patients in a non-intrusive way. From a preliminary set of experiments, it is seen that the hippocampus area of mice clearly reacts to the lighting at low frequency, showing the influence of light intensity variation on degenerative neurological diseases. This suggests that the future standardization of VLC needs to consider not only the system transmission performance but also its potential impact on human beings for indoor applications.",

      "abstract": "Future emerging communication technologies are anticipated to fold into our surroundings, helping us get our noses off the smartphone screens and back into our environments. In doing so, they make us more (rather than less) present in the world around us. While 5G was supposed to be about the Internet of Everything, to be transformative 6G might be just about the opposite of Everything, that is, Nothing or, more technically, No Things. Building on the invisible-to-visible technology concept, this article explores how the full potential of multisensory extended reality (XR) experiences may be unleashed in Multiverse cross-reality environments. We exploit the convergence of artificial-intelligence-enhanced multi-access edge computing, intelligent mobile robots, and blockchain technologies to help realize the Internet of No Things as an important stepping stone toward ushering in the 6G post-smartphone era. In our experiments, we consider locally connected human-avatar/robot collectives and investigate our proposed extrasensory perception network, which integrates the three evolutionary mobile computing stages of ubiquitous, pervasive, and persuasive computing. As an illustrative example of advanced XR experiences, we study the delivery of sixth-sense perceptions that transverse the boundary between Multiverse realms in order to mimic the quantum realm.",

      "abstract": "An important task in the Internet of Things (IoT) is field monitoring, where multiple IoT nodes take measurements and communicate them to the base station or the cloud for processing, inference, and analysis. When the measurements are high-dimensional (e.g., videos or time-series data), IoT networks with limited bandwidth and low-power devices may not be able to support such frequent transmissions with high data rates. To ensure communication efficiency, this article proposes to model the measurement compression at IoT nodes and the inference at the base station or cloud as a deep neural network (DNN). We propose a new framework where the data to be transmitted from nodes are the intermediate outputs of a layer of the DNN. We show how to learn the model parameters of the DNN and study the trade-off between the communication rate and the inference accuracy. The experimental results show that we can save approximately 96 percent transmissions with only a degradation of 2.5 percent in inference accuracy, which shows the potentiality to enable many new IoT data analysis applications that generate a large amount of measurements.",

      "abstract": "The finance industry is being pushed by regulation to register most of its operations with timestamps legally traceable to a Coordinated Universal Time reference with up to 1 ms error. This poses a challenge for the sector, since the most commonly used solutions to provide time in the industry might not comply with the requirements. While the typical network-based solutions might not be able to reach the needed level of time accuracy when used in large networks, the satellite-based options can easily be subject to external interference or attacks. Additionally, both approaches struggle when traceability to legal time is required. Our proposed service consists in offering the performance of White Rabbit time transfer over commercial optical fiber networks, the accuracy of atomic clocks continuously compared to the legal time reference, and the resiliency of a client node with holdover capabilities better than 1.5 ms after 24 hours. This design has already been put into place to provide a time service to the Spanish stock market operator. Our approach is easily scalable and can be used to provide a future-proof time as a service solution to a large number of customers from a single location.",

      "abstract": "Reliable data connectivity is vital for the ever increasingly intelligent, automated, and ubiquitous digital world. Mobile networks are the data highways and, in a fully connected, intelligent digital world, will need to connect everything, including people to vehicles, sensors, data, cloud resources, and even robotic agents. Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, which are currently being deployed, offer significant advances beyond LTE, but may be unable to meet the full connectivity demands of the future digital society. Therefore, this article discusses technologies that will evolve wireless networks toward a sixth generation (6G) and which we consider as enablers for several potential 6G use cases. We provide a fullstack, system-level perspective on 6G scenarios and requirements, and select 6G technologies that can satisfy them either by improving the 5G design or by introducing completely new communication paradigms.",

      "abstract": "Computation offloading through stateless applications is gaining momentum thanks to the emergence of serverless frameworks with inherent scalability properties. However, adoption of a serverless framework in an edge computing system requires careful consideration to keep its advantages unscathed. In the cloud, micro-services are scaled automatically according to demands, but in edge computing this would incur a significantly higher cost than in a data center and cannot be as fluid. This is especially relevant in scenarios where edge nodes are spread across large areas and have relatively small computation capabilities. In this article we propose to overcome this issue by adapting the allocation of demands to the currently allocated micro-services at short timescales, with two alternative mechanisms designed for different target scenarios, both aimed at enabling distributed computing environments. The proposed solution can be integrated within the ETSI MEC standard, which specifies a reference architecture and open service interfaces. Our contribution is validated in a proof-of-concept scenario with a prototype implementation released as open source.",

      "abstract": "Recent evolutions in semiconductors have brought the terahertz band into the spotlight as an enabler for terabit-per-second communications in 6G networks. Most of the research so far, however, has focused on understanding the physics of terahertz devices, circuitry, and propagation, and on studying physical layer solutions. However, integrating this technology in complex mobile networks requires proper design of the full communication stack, to address link- and system-level challenges related to network setup, management, coordination, energy efficiency, and end-to-end connectivity. This article provides an overview of the issues that need to be overcome to introduce the terahertz spectrum in mobile networks, from a MAC, network, and transport layer perspective, with consideration on the performance of end-to-end data flows on terahertz connections.",

Ensuring that health ML/AI models are trustworthy will consequently become increasingly important soon. The ITU/WHO focus group on \"AI for Health\" is working on validation standards for health AI that can help to assess the quality of the powerful but complex technologies in a comparable and transparent manner. In particular, standardized benchmarking can serve as a valuable tool to determine the merits and limits of different health ML/AI models. In this article, ongoing work of the ITU/WHO initiative is introduced and set into perspective with related digital health and AI standardization efforts.",

      "abstract": "Container-based virtualization has recently been flourishing due to its ease of deployment and flexibility of resource provisioning. Kubernetes, a well-known open source project, is an orchestration platform for containerized applications. Herein, applications can have multiple replicas to provide high scalability and availability, but some applications for stateful service require a leader to be elected to maintain consistency and coordinate tasks among the replicas. In this article, the Kubernetes architecture is first analyzed by focusing on load balancing, a leader election algorithm, and a leader-based consistency maintenance mechanism. Then we address the following challenges: the leader has heavy loads due to its inherent design, and the Kubernetes leader election algorithm cannot evenly distribute the leader throughout nodes. Finally, experimental results are provided to prove the importance of leader distribution throughout nodes in the cluster for highly scalable load balancing.",

These deployments rely on either professional-grade measurement stations or a small number of low-cost sensors integrated into urban infrastructure. In this article, we present a research vision of real-time massive scale air quality sensing that integrates tens of thousands or even millions of air quality sensors to monitor air quality at fine spatial and temporal resolution. We highlight opportunities and challenges of our vision by discussing use cases, key requirements, and reference technologies in order to establish a roadmap on how to realize this vision. We address the feasibility of our vision, introducing a testbed deployment in Helsinki, Finland, and carrying out controlled experiments that address collaborative and opportunistic sensor calibration, a key research challenge for our vision.",

      "abstract": "RAN slicing refers to a vision where multiple MNOs are assigned virtual networks (i.e., slices) instantiated on top of the same physical network resources. Existing work in this area has addressed RAN slicing at different levels of network abstraction, but has often neglected the multitude of tightly intertwined inter-level operations involved in practical slicing systems. For this reason, this article discusses a novel framework for operator-to-waveform 5G RAN slicing. In the proposed framework, slicing operations are treated holistically, including MNOs' selection of base stations and maximum number of users, down to the waveform-level scheduling of resource blocks. Simulation results show that the proposed framework generates RAN slices where 95 percent of allocated resources can be used to perform coordination- based 5G transmission technologies, and facilitates the coexistence of multiple RAN slices providing up to 120 percent improvement in terms of SINR experienced by mobile users.",

      "abstract": "Neutral host SCPs represent a key element of the 5G vision of ultra-dense mobile networks. However, current business models mostly focus on multi-year agreements for large venues, such as stadiums and hotel chains. These business agreements are regulated through binding SLAs, which tend to be too cumbersome and costly for smaller-scale SCPs. As a result, the neutral host model does not scale up to its full potential. In this article, we propose a framework to enable the participation of small- to medium-sized players in the cellular market as providers offering network resources to MNOs. To this purpose, we review the current and emerging spectrum and technology opportunities that SCPs can use for neutral host deployments. We also propose the use of blockchain-enabled smart contracts as a simple and cost-efficient alternative to traditional SLAs for small-scale SCPs. To demonstrate this, we describe a proof of concept implementation of an Ethereum-based smart contract platform for best effort service between an SCP and an MNO. Our simulations on potential smart contract-based deployments in city center Dublin show that the received signal strength in the considered area will increase by an average of 10 percent.",

It has been considered to be one of the key missing components in the existing 5G network and is widely recognized to be one of the most sought after functions for tomorrow's wireless 6G cellular systems. In this article, we identify the key requirements and challenges of edge-native AI in 6G. A self-learning architecture based on self-supervised generative adversarial nets is introduced to demonstrate the potential performance improvement that can be achieved by automatic data learning and synthesizing at the edge of the network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed self-learning architecture in a university campus shuttle system connected via a 5G network. Our result shows that the proposed architecture has the potential to identify and classify unknown services that emerge in edge computing networks. Future trends and key research problems for self-learning-enabled 6G edge intelligence are also discussed.",

However, hologram-based applications will place significant demands on networking infrastructure, which are not supported today. These include support for ultra-low delays, high bandwidth, and the ability to coordinate, synchronize, and dynamically adapt multiple data streams. This article articulates these challenges and points out gaps in existing networks that solutions must address. In addition, it provides an experimental analysis of novel network architectures that address one of these challenges, namely the ability to dynamically set up new flows with very low latency incurred by the first packet.",

Common parameters estimated by OPM include optical power, optical signal-to-noise ratio, chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and so on. To be cost-effective and integrated, a universal OPM for multiple parameters realized on a single hardware platform is highly desirable. Although the sources of distinct impairments are independent, the induced distortions on the signal are mixed together, thus challenging the realization of universal OPM. In this article, the existing OPM methods are reviewed with a focus on those based on spectral analysis. A viable solution of universal OPM based on a double-homodyne scheme with all low-cost components is presented.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the digital transformation of the industry, whole value chains get connected across various application domains as long as economic, ecological, or social benefits arise to do so. Under the umbrella of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), traditional operational technology (OT) approaches are replaced or at least augmented by information and communication technology (ICT) systems to facilitate this development. To meet industrial requirements, for example, related to privacy, determinism, latency, or autonomy, established cloud computing mechanisms are being moved closer to data sources and actuators. Depending on the context, this distributed cloud computing paradigm is named edge computing or fog computing, and various challenges have been subject to several publications. However, a proper reference model that describes the multi-dimensional problem space, which is being spanned by this paradigm, seems still to be undefined. Such a model should provide orientation, put work in relation, and support the identification of current and future research issues. This article aims to fill this gap with a focus on industrial automation and follows analog models that have been developed for specific domains such as the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) and the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI4.0). The proposed Reference Architecture Model Edge Computing (RAMEC) identifies 210 views on the edge computing paradigm in the manufacturing domain. Future iterations of this model might be used for the classification of relevant research, standardization, and development activities.",

      "abstract": "The recent revival of AI is revolutionizing almost every branch of science and technology. Given the ubiquitous smart mobile gadgets and IoT devices, it is expected that a majority of intelligent applications will be deployed at the edge of wireless networks. This trend has generated strong interest in realizing an \"intelligent edge\" to support AI-enabled applications at various edge devices. Accordingly, a new research area, called edge learning, has emerged, which crosses and revolutionizes two disciplines: wireless communication and machine learning. A major theme in edge learning is to overcome the limited computing power, as well as limited data, at each edge device. This is accomplished by leveraging the mobile edge computing platform and exploiting the massive data distributed over a large number of edge devices. In such systems, learning from distributed data and communicating between the edge server and devices are two critical and coupled aspects, and their fusion poses many new research challenges. This article advocates a new set of design guidelines for wireless communication in edge learning, collectively called learning- driven communication. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these design guidelines. Unique research opportunities are identified.",

      "abstract": "IRS is a new and revolutionizing technology that is able to significantly improve the performance of wireless communication networks, by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment with the use of massive low-cost passive reflecting elements integrated on a planar surface. Specifically, different elements of an IRS can independently reflect the incident signal by controlling its amplitude and/or phase and thereby collaboratively achieve fine-grained 3D passive beamforming for directional signal enhancement or nulling. In this article, we first provide an overview of the IRS technology, including its main applications in wireless communication, competitive advantages over existing technologies, hardware architecture as well as the corresponding new signal model. We then address the key challenges in designing and implementing the new IRS-aided hybrid (with both active and passive components) wireless network, as compared to the traditional network comprising active components only. Finally, numerical results are provided to show the great performance enhancement with the use of IRS in typical wireless networks.",

      "abstract": "The data collected from IoT devices on various emissions or pollution can have significant economic value for stakeholders. This makes it prone to abuse or tampering and brings forward the need to integrate IoT with a DLT to collect, store, and protect the IoT data. However, the DLT brings additional overhead to the frugal IoT connectivity and symmetrizes the IoT traffic, thus changing the usual assumption that IoT is uplink-oriented. We have implemented a platform that integrates DLTs with a monitoring system based on NB-IoT. We evaluate the performance and discuss the trade-offs in two use cases: data authorization and real-time monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Industrial automation has created a high demand for private 5G networks, the deployment of which calls for an efficient and reliable solution to ensure strict compliance with regulatory emission limits. While traditional methods for measuring outdoor interference include collecting real-world data by walking or driving, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers an attractive alternative due to their flexible mobility and adaptive altitude. As UAVs perform measurements quickly and semiautomatically, they can potentially assist in near-real-time adjustments of the network configuration and fine-tuning its parameters, such as antenna settings and transmit power, as well as help improve indoor connectivity while respecting outdoor emission constraints. This article offers a firsthand tutorial on using aerial 5G emission assessment for interference management in nonpublic networks by reviewing the key challenges of UAV-mounted radio scanner measurements. In particular, we outline the challenges of practical assessment of the outdoor interference originating from a local indoor 5G network while discussing regulatory and other related constraints, and address practical methods and tools while summarizing the recent results of our measurement campaign. The reported proof of concept confirms that UAV-based systems represent a promising tool for capturing outdoor interference from private 5G systems.",

This might no longer hold in future networks supporting services with stringent quality of service constraints such as extremely low latency, low energy, and/or large number of simultaneously connected devices, where acquiring CSI would become extremely costly or even impractical. We overview the main limitations of CSI at the transmitter side (CSIT)-based designs toward the 6G era, assess how to design and use efficient CSIT-limited schemes that allow meeting the new and stringent requirements, and highlight some key research directions. We delve into the ideas of efficiently allocating pilot sequences, relying on statistical CSIT and/or using location-based strategies, and demonstrate viability via a selected use case.",

      "abstract": "Implantable medical devixes (IMDs) have been gaining increasing interest for their advantages of precise monitoring and diagnostics of chronic diseases. The usefulness of IMDs resides in improving the power efficiency of the implants-to-surface communication, which consumes most of the battery power. To tackle this challenging requirement, this article introduces a novel optical wireless communication approach that employs an unsynchronized pulse interval modulation technique dedicated to IMDs. A design principle for ultra-low-power optical wireless communication is addressed, and a prototype design is implemented within a small form factor of 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm \u00d7 2.3 mm. Experiments over biological channels ensure that the transmitted signal penetrates skin samples in various ranges of thickness with sub-milliwatt-level power consumption as low as 392 mW. Finally, technical challenges that will be faced in the extension of applications are discussed. The developed approach opens new opportunities for realizing ultra-low-power communication electronics for viable future applications in wireless communications, including medical devices, inter-chip communication, and free-space optics.",

      "abstract": "With significant advancements of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technologies in recent years, intelligent collaboration between connected vehicles and roadside units provides new opportunities for better road safety and vehicle traffic management via innovative non-signalized intersections. In this article, to deal with sophisticated traffic information brought about by a dynamic non-signalized intersection environment, artificial intelligence (AI) solutions together with V2X communication technologies are proposed to provide data-driven intersection management strategies. We first present the emerging technologies and key challenges toward V2X empowered non-signalized intersection management. By introducing the applications of typical AI technologies, we pinpoint three main research issues on V2X empowered non-signalized intersection management, leveraging various AI approaches. Finally, we present a case study where a multi-agent learning approach is applied for intelligent multiple intersection management to demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-signalized intersection solution.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are fast moving from connected vehicles on the road to autonomous driving. Vehicular communication is a key enabler for the deployment of advanced ITS applications such as platooning and remote vehicle control. DSRC and C-V2X are two key wireless technologies that will play a vital role in the implementation and deployment of an autonomous transport system. We review the current standardization efforts for both of these technologies with a focus on MAC and PHY layers. The automotive industry and research community have been working on new standards -- IEEE 802.11bd (for DSRC) and 5G NR V2X (for C-V2X) -- to meet the high reliability and low latency requirements of autonomous driving. We also highlight the major changes that have been made to previous standards such as IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X. Finally, we present open challenges that need to be addressed to further improve these standards for vehicular communications.",

      "abstract": "Vessels cybersecurity is gaining momentum as a result of a few recent attacks on vessels at sea. These recent attacks have shocked the maritime domain, which was thought to be relatively immune to cyber threats. That belief is now over, as proved by recent mandates issued by the International Maritime Organization. According to these regulations, all vessels should be the subject of a cybersecurity risk analysis, and technical controls should be adopted to mitigate the resulting risks. This initiative is laudable since, despite the recent incidents, the vulnerabilities and threats affecting modern vessels are still unclear to operating entities, leaving the potential for dreadful consequences of further attacks just a matter of \"when,\" not \"if.\" In this contribution, we investigate and systematize the major security weaknesses affecting systems and communication technologies adopted in modern vessels. Specifically, we describe the architecture and main features of the different systems, pointing out their main security issues, and specifying how they were exploited by attackers to cause service disruption and relevant financial losses. We also identify a few countermeasures to the introduced attacks. Finally, we highlight a few research challenges to be addressed by industry and academia to strengthen vessels security.",

In this article, to emphasize sustainable energy consumption and improved device battery lifetime, the concept, benefits, and challenges of utilizing wake-up radio-based access in 5G networks are reviewed and discussed. To this end, the operating principle and associated wake-up signal structures are first reviewed, together with the corresponding power consumption and buffering delay trade-offs. Then the applicability of wake-up methods at mmWave bands and beamforming systems is addressed and highlighted. Additionally, an energy-efficient mobility management procedure for wake-up radio-based devices is described and demonstrated, utilizing narrowband uplink reference signals. Overall, the article provides an overview of wake-up-based access in 5G systems as a promising power-saving mechanism, and discusses the associated prospects, benefits, and challenges.",

      "abstract": "Web browsing is the main Internet service, and every customer wants the minimum web page loading times. To satisfy this perpetual need, web browsers offer new processing engines and increased functionalities. Web developers make use of new programming languages and paradigms, new transport protocols have been introduced, network operators offer increased bandwidth, and CDN providers deploy web servers closest to end users. To assess the efficiency of these evolutions, delivered performance is often evaluated in a standalone manner, without considering the whole chain of web browsing. We propose Web View, a measurement platform that performs automated web browsing sessions on popular websites in a user-representative environment. Through different configurable parameters, Web View measures a wide set of information in order to evaluate the impact of the different parameters (transport protocols, web browsers, CDN, access networks, etc.). Based on those measurements, to ease the understanding of web browsing and the corresponding evolutions, Web View offers a public visualization website (https://webview. orange.com). For instance, with Web View, we were able to detect that the use of different CDNs at different times of the day can decrease loading times up to 400 percent and that the delivery of content through different transport protocols can decrease loading times up to 79 percent. This article presents the Web View measurement platform as well as remarkable events we noticed during more than one year of measurements.",

      "abstract": "To facilitate the deployment of machine learning in resource and privacy-constrained systems such as the Internet of Things, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a means for enabling edge devices to train a shared learning model while promoting privacy. However, Google's seminal FL algorithm requires all devices to be directly connected with a central controller, which limits its applications. In contrast, this article introduces a novel FL framework, called collaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with less reliance on a central controller. The fundamentals of this framework are developed and a number of communication techniques are proposed so as to improve CFL performance. An overview of centralized learning, Google's FL, and CFL is presented. For each type of learning, the basic architecture as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and operating conditions are introduced. Then four CFL performance metrics are presented, and a suite of communication techniques ranging from network formation, device scheduling, mobility management, to coding are introduced to optimize the performance of CFL. For each technique, future research opportunities are discussed. In a nutshell, this article showcases how CFL can be effectively implemented at the edge of large-scale wireless systems.",

This article presents the opportunities and challenges posed by a novel class of antennas referred to as DMA for wireless sensing. In contrast to conventional solutions that rely on either frequency diversity or spatial diversity for sensing, the proposed system exploits the antenna pattern diversity and software programmability of the DMA to achieve high-performance wireless sensing. We present a general framework for DMA-based wireless sensing, and demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the DMA in sensing using custom hardware. We identify several research challenges and future directions to fully realize this new concept.",

      "abstract": "The reduced link margins caused by undesired blockage such as the user's hand and inherent limitations of beamsteering angles for planar antenna components constitute one of the most critical challenges for future mmWave mobile devices. This underscores the need for a new beamforming antenna strategy, which can enhance the foreside coverage with minimum compromise. This article provides a detailed overview of an mmWave beamforming antenna concept denoted as an optically invisible antenna-on-display (AoD), which can enhance the CDF, especially in the foreside direction of mobile devices such as cellular handsets. In contrast to existing antenna component strategies, the AoD is integrated within the view area of high-resolution OLED or LCD display panels of cellular handsets while remaining unnoticeable to the human eye through the use of nano-scale patterns. This allows the realization of highly precise beamforming in the foreside direction for large-screen mobile devices. The fundamental phased-array AoD strategy is introduced and compared with existing mmWave 5G beamforming antenna strategies for mmWave 5G NR cellular handsets. The operating mechanism of the mmWave 5G phased-array AoD component and its integration with existing wireless component architectures and a 537 ppi density OLED panel are considered. This concept is further refined by integrating a series of fabricated 28 GHz phased-array AoD components within a real-life mmWave 5G NR Android-based cellular handset prototype reported in the literature for the first time. The foreside beamforming characteristics at 28 GHz are experimentally studied followed by investigation of OTA measured EVMs using QPSK, 16- and 64-QAM mmWave 5G NR waveform signals in accordance with the 3GPP requirement.",
