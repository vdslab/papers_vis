   "abstract": "A highly versatile modulator that uses digital signal processing methods is described. The scheme can realize most known modulations exhibiting diverse forms of signal spectrum and eye diagram, and it can realize a given modulation with extreme precision. A single modulator unit can be host to many forms of modulation, i.e. many forms of signal constellations and spectral shapes. The technique also tends itself very well to very large-scale integration (VLSI) and mass production.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "Since the early 1970s, for power-limited applications, the convolutional code constraint length K=7 and rate 1/2, optimum in the sense of maximum free distance and minimum number of bit errors caused by remerging paths at the free distance, has become the de facto standard for coded digital communication. This was reinforced when punctured versions of this code became the standard for rate 3/4 and 7/8 codes for moderately bandlimited channels. Methods are described for using the same K=7, rate 1/2 convolutional code with signal phase constellations of 8-PSK and 160PSK and quadrature amplitude constellations of 16-QASK, 64-QASK, and 256-QASK to achieve, respectively, 2 and 3, and 2, 4, and 6 b/s/Hz bandwidth efficiencies while providing power efficiency that in most cases is virtually equivalent to that of the best Ungerboeck codes for constraint length 7 or 64 states. This pragmatic approach to all coding applications permits the use of a single basic coder and decoder to achieve respectable coding (power) gains for bandwidth efficiencies from 1 b/s/Hz to 6 b/s/Hz.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The transport layer of the protocol suite, especially in connectionless protocols, has considerable functionality and is typically executed in software by the host processor at the end points of the network. It is thus considered a likely source of processing overhead. However, a preliminary examination has suggested to the authors that other aspects of networking may be a more serious source of overhead. To test this proposition, a detailed study was made of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the transport protocol from the Internet protocol suite. In this set of protocols, the functions of detecting and recovering lost or corrupted packets, flow control, and multiplexing are performed at the transport level. The results of that study are presented. It is concluded that TCP is in fact not the source of the overhead often observed in packet processing, and that it could support very high speeds if properly implemented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The measurements have all been run on the same Sun 3/60 workstations over Ethernet, using protocol-independent benchmarks. A tool called SICS Protocol Implementation Measurement System (SPIMS) is used for the measurements. It is structured as a protocol, with two peer entities communicating with each other using the service of the measured protocol. The authors describe how SPIMS can be used to measure response time, throughput, and the time to open and close connections. They describe the protocols and their implementations, and draw some conclusions, and present and comment on the results.&lt;&lt;ETX&gt;&gt;",

It is comprised of several baseband Ethernet segments connected by local Ethernet repeaters and standard LAN Bridge 100 devices, which extend a LAN. Measurements carried out to determine whether the capacity of the Ethernet had been reached or exceeded are discussed. The measurements showed that the bandwidth was not reached or exceeded. They also showed that the measured traffic load and the numbers of devices connected to the Ethernet did not pose traffic throughput problems to the user community. In addition, it was found that a larger LAN configuration could be achieved by using Ethernet bridges and taking advantage of address filtering, which distributes and thus reduces traffic loads on specific segments.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Burst transport is integrated in that voice and data are switched through the same switching fabric and transmission media. Burst switching is compared to and distinguished from fast packet, fast circuit, and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) switching. Misunderstandings about burst transport that have appeared in the literature are corrected, to wit: burst does not immediately clip in case of channel contention; burst switches voice and data in the same way; and a burst switch interfaces naturally to other types of switches. Round-trip delay performance is calculated to be less than 5 ms. The current status of the burst project is described.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "A number of proposed and/or demonstrated approaches to video distribution on fiber are highlighted. Each of the architectures described embodies a different combination of delivery mode, degree of fiber utilization, transmission format, and multiplexing technique. The various approaches typically rely on different classes of technologies and can result in different service capabilities. Since available technologies and service demands generally evolve with time, the architectures are presented in an evolutionary manner, beginning with those that appear technologically and economically feasible in the early 1990s, and ending with more sophisticated techniques targeted for the late 1990s and beyond. For each time frame, key technology and system issues are stressed, as well as limits and driving forces that may trigger evolution to later, more advanced architectures. The key design considerations that are common to all of these approaches and the factors that will ultimately govern the pace of evolution from one class of architectures to another are summarized.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The CCITT has developed a recommendation for Group 3 facsimile that is based on the transmission of binary picture elements (pels) having a brightness value that is either black or white. By introducing a minor modification into the basically bilevel facsimile system, dither coding delivers an output image that conveys gray-scale information. An analysis is made of three dither coding techniques: random dither, clumped dither and distributed dither. The comparison of random and clumped dither was also studied by simulation. The random dither simulation runs having the intermediate random number range (RNR=192) exhibited the best combination of maximum image quality and minimum number of transmitted bits, relative to the other random dither runs. The clumped dither images are superior to the best random dither image when both image quality and transmitted bits are considered. For clumped dither, the average compression ratio for the three images is only 1.39, which is significantly poorer than for the same images without dither coding. This compression ratio corresponds to a transmission time of 4.5 min over the public switched telephone network. Although this time is significantly longer than the 1 min typical for nondithered pictures, this performance may be most satisfactory for many requirements and applications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The author presents an overview of fundamental considerations that guide and motivate research in this area. He explores the relationship between the bandwidth of the fiber, the available power and the loss in various network designs, and the throughput of networks as limited by the medium-access techniques and control mechanisms. He discusses two approaches to opening up the bottleneck that seem particularly promising. The first, multihop, uses a novel network architecture to achieve high capacity with existing devices; the second, wavelength division multiple access (WDMA), emphasizes new devices in a relatively conventional architecture. Noting that the primary disadvantage of the bus topology, poor energy efficiency, could be overcome with a suitable optical amplifier to compensate for the high signal attenuation in the network, the author discusses one of the most promising candidates, the traveling-wave semiconductor amplifier. He also discusses medium-access considerations.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is concluded that while the worst fears of competitors, regulators, and rate payers have not been realized, neither have the full benefits of an integrated information society. It is suggested that the primary reason for the lack of progress in realizing the public benefits of divestiture and deregulation is the failure of national telecommunications policymakers to jointly develop and agree on a vision for the USA telecommunications industry, and to articulate the policy goals required to fulfil that vision. The outlook for the next five years is discussed, stressing the importance of the public policy environment with respect to both regulation and international trade.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In these preliminary experiments, the results are limited to static images of vowels. It is demonstrated that these networks are able to extract speech information from the visual images and that this information can be used to improve automatic vowel recognition. The structure of speech and its corresponding acoustic and visual signals are reviewed. The specific data that was used in the experiments along with the network architectures and algorithms are described. The results of integrating the visual and auditory signals for vowel recognition in the presence of acoustic noise are presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He does so by describing the features and network applications of a specific multiwavelength network, the Bellcore LAMBDANET packet switch. The discussion is then extended to a number of recent proposals for switching fabrics based on this new multiwavelength technology. The particular technologies he discusses are: the photonic knockout switch, a proposal similar to the concept of the LAMBDANET, but not requiring N receivers at each node; the FOX (fast optical cross-connect), an active wavelength routing approach; the ShuffleNet architecture; the HYPASS and BHYPASS switches; the coherent wavelength division lambda switch; and the Bellcore Star-Track multicast switch.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He notes that the highly interconnected architecture of switching networks suggests similarities to neural networks. He presents two switching applications in which neural networks can solve the problems efficiently. He shows that a computational advantage can be gained by using nonuniform time delays in the network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "Active and passive multiplexing technologies and alternative architectural approaches to diverse routing for fiber-loop networks are described. It is shown on the basis of Markov models that the mean time to failure (MTTF) for a 1:1 protected system can be significantly improved by deploying fiber with alternate paths and duplicate central offices. Specific network examples are used to compare installed first costs of the active and passive multiplexing alternatives for various loop-diversity approaches. The results indicate the requirements for diverse routing can have a large impact on the choice of technologies and approaches for fiber loop networks. Specifically, a passive double-star architecture, using dense wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) techniques, represents a promising technological approach to diverse routing, for it has the lowest installed first cost for diversity in the loop of the several approaches studied, both in suburban and urban areas.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

GaAs is an excellent material for this purpose, since it can be used to fabricate both fast electronic circuits and optical sources and detectors.

The focus is on the common master-slave synchronization designs, generally consisting of three subsystems: the primary clock supply, the slave clock supply, and the clock distribution system overlaid on the digital network. Network synchronization performance is specified with relative clock frequency stability and accuracy of the corresponding reference clock. An overview is also given of clock and jitter and wander specification methodologies discussed in CCITT.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The author discusses major changes in the nature of telecommunication standards over the past 15 years. Fifteen years ago, standards followed technology, and manufacturers dominated standards activities. Contentions were avoided by adoption of multiple options in the standards. Today, users have a large presence in standards development. They demand interoperability of products and reject nonresolution on contentions. Standards processes are protracted and standards now lead technology. The author identifies three major trends. (1) Consumers and users in the telecommunications industry are increasingly demanding compliance with standards. (2) Standards activities are growing at a rapid rate. (3) There is a growing sense of urgency about standards. He asserts that these major trends can only be satisfied through increasing the responsiveness by standards bodies. He suggests seven ways to press for process control in standards bodies.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

To achieve the longest span length possible, the system combines terrestrial terminals containing superior-performance optoelectronic devices with ultrareliable undersea cable technology. The lightwave technology used to achieve cost-effective, long-span repeaterless undersea lightwave systems is discussed. This includes undersea fiber and cable, lasers and receivers, and terminal equipment. The first application of this technology, Taiwan's Tainan to Peng-Hu system, is described. The possibilities for increasing the maximum attainable span length of high-capacity repeaterless undersea systems are examined. Key elements are higher-output transmitters, more sensitive receivers, and improved optical fibers.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The use of pulse shaping to control transmitted spectral density precisely is examined. A digital filter architecture is described that not only mitigates the traditional problems of lengthy development intervals and cost manufacturing methods, but offers the additional features of intrinsically coding high-speed binary (M=2) data into M-ary symbols while ensuring highly reproducible, baud-normalized, transmitter pulse shaping. A conceptual basis for the digital synthesis method is first described, including a functional circuit appropriate to the simplest filter realizations. Spectral effects internal to the filter are considered, and a simple method to obtain desired transmitted spectra is outlined. It is shown that even relatively short pulses used in high-level modulation systems lead to impractical memory storage demands; however, the simple expedient of segmenting the finite impulse function greatly reduced the individual memory requirements, though it necessitates intermediate adding operations. Experimental examples illustrate the design methodology for quaternary (M=4) data signals in a Nyquist communication channel and serve as points of reference for addressing performance and design flexibility.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The user still has to be something of an expert to understand how to make international calls, and there are chaotically differing numbering systems for telephony, telex, and electronic mail. We should be reminded that usability of services, not just their usefulness, is a critical component of communications. Simplicity, consistency, and rationality of service features and the 'human interface' that allows users to invoke them should be a high priority for communications engineers as they work toward the integrated services networks of the future.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The report, which is broad in scope, stresses the virtues of limited government involvement and maximum possible reliance on the private sector. It reviews the problems of simply transferring pro-competitive, deregulatory US policies from the domestic to the international communications arena. The report demonstrates how communications policy choices will affect a broad range of other topics, such as educational opportunities, the global competitiveness of American industry, and the quality of national life. The great importance of effectively competitive international communications and the trend toward liberalization in key overseas markets is also addressed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The author argues that though telecommunications is in a new era, the industry is operating in an environment designed for a past era in which government policies helped foster the expansion of national networks, built by monopolies that operated under varying degrees of oversight. He maintains that the transition from monopoly-based regulation to oversight of a competitive industry has gotten stuck somewhere in the middle, a no-man's-land called 'regulated competition', putting AT&amp;T at a competitive disadvantage with its long-distance rivals. While some of the resulting marketplace distortions will clear up as regulatory rules are peeled away over time, he regards it as urgent that unnecessary and unneeded regulatory restraints be removed quickly, because they act as a drag on competitive response in an industry that is crucial to the global competitiveness of US business and industry. The author also examines the effect of government policies beyond the US shoreline on the competitiveness of US telecommunications in world markets.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is shown that VSAT networks are cost-competitive with terrestrial networks at around $300 per month per VSAT. For HUB costs in the range of $100000 the VSAT network can be cost-competitive for networks as small as 100 VSATs. Networks smaller than 100 VSATs are not cost-competitive, because the space segment cost becomes a dominant cost contributor.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The first of these applications explores the possibility of realizing a VSAT-based satellite wide area network (SWAN) to provide flexible interconnection between local area networks (LANs) and metropolitan area networks (MANs) as well as gateway access to centralized information databases and computing services. A second application deals with the potential provision of ISDN-compatible services via VSATs in conjunction with existing satellites as well as future advanced satellites (ADSATs) having onboard switching and processing capabilities. The use of VSATs to solve backhaul interconnection/internetworking problems associated with evolving mobile satellite (MSAT) communication networks is discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The authors review noncoherent, frequency-tunable filter (receiver) technologies. They describe three basic mechanisms of wavelength filtering: filters that are based on the wavelength dependence of interferometric phenomena, with emphasis on Fabry-Perot interferometer filters; filters that are based on the wavelength dependence of coupling between optical fields (modes) induced by external perturbations (both acoustooptic and electrooptic filters are described); and filters that are based on resonant amplification of optical signals in semiconductor laser diode devices (these devices provide gain in addition to wavelength selectivity). For each technology the authors explain briefly the principles of operation and quantify the relevant system parameters: tuning range, channel separation, number of channels, crosstalk isolation, gain and distortion, speed of wavelength tuning, and complexity. They present a unified picture of filtering mechanisms in an appendix.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
