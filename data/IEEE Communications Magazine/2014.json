   "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of sensor-rich smartphones, mobile crowd sensing has become a popular research field. In this article, we propose a four-stage life cycle (i.e., task creation, task assignment, individual task execution, and crowd data integration) to characterize the mobile crowd sensing process, and use 4W1H (i.e., what, when, where, who, and how) to sort out the research problems in the mobile crowd sensing domain. Furthermore, we attempt to foresee some new research directions in future mobile crowd sensing research.",

   "abstract": "This article provides some fundamental indications about wireless communications beyond LTE/LTE-A (5G), representing the key findings of the European research project 5GNOW. We start with identifying the drivers for making the transition to 5G networks. Just to name one, the advent of the Internet of Things and its integration with conventional human-initiated transmissions creates a need for a fundamental system redesign. Then we make clear that the strict paradigm of synchronism and orthogonality as applied in LTE prevents efficiency and scalability. We challenge this paradigm and propose new key PHY layer technology components such as a unified frame structure, multicarrier waveform design including a filtering functionality, sparse signal processing mechanisms, a robustness framework, and transmissions with very short latency. These components enable indeed an efficient and scalable air interface supporting the highly varying set of requirements originating from the 5G drivers.",

   "abstract": "Industrial and IP-enabled low-power wireless networking technologies are converging, resulting in the Industrial Internet of Things. On the one hand, low-power wireless solutions are available today that answer the strict reliability and power consumption requirements of industrial applications. These solutions are based on Time- Synchronized Channel Hopping, a medium access control technique at the heart of industrial standards such as the WirelessHART and ISA100.11a, and layer 1 and 2 standards such as IEEE802.15.4e. On the other hand, a range of standards have been published to allow low-power wireless devices to communicate using the Internet Protocol (IP), thereby becoming true \u201cfingers of the Internet,\u201d and greatly simplifying their integration into existing networks. This article acknowledges the standardization effort to combine those capabilities. The networks resulting from this convergence exhibit reliability and power consumption performances compatible with demanding industrial applications, while being easy to integrate, and following the end-to-end paradigm of today's Internet. In particular, this article presents the work being done in 6TiSCH, a newly-formed working group in the Internet Engineering Task Force, which is standardizing the mechanisms making the Industrial Internet of Things a reality.",

   "abstract": "North American service providers are in the process of upgrading their radio access networks with next generation LTE equipment. They are finalizing a 4G rollout that involves highly stringent timing requirements, but in many cases they are relying on sole-source synchronization by using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Natural occurring disturbances, as well as unintentional radio frequency jamming, intentional jamming, and spoofing, make GNSS vulnerable to interference. This article presents a novel approach for addressing the issue of GNSS vulnerability by introducing a standard means of providing a redundant packet-based synchronization source for LTE base stations. It also describes how this new approach can mitigate noise caused by asymmetry and transit delay variation in packet networks.",

   "abstract": "In the large-scale petrochemical industry, one of the most concerning problems is the leakage of toxic gas. To solve this problem, it is necessary to locate the leak points and feed the possible location of leak points back to rescuers. Although some researchers have previously presented several methods to locate leak points, they ignored the impact of external factors, such as wind, and internal factors, such as the internal pressure of equipment, on the accurate detection of leak points. Fundamentally, both of those factors belong to context-aware data in a context-aware system. Therefore, this article proposes a context-aware system architecture for leak point detection in the large-scale petrochemical industry. In this three-layer architecture, a distributed database based on data categorization is designed in the storage layer, which is able to choose the most efficient approach to store the context-aware data from the gathering layer according to different context-aware data types. Then a real-time template matching algorithm for context-aware systems is presented in the computing layer to process the context-aware data stream. The architecture is a new scheme for accurate leak point detection, which is more consistent with practical application in the large scale petrochemical industry.",

   "abstract": "The tremendous growth in wireless Internet use is showing no signs of slowing down. Existing cellular networks are starting to be insufficient in meeting this demand, in part due to their inflexible and expensive equipment as well as complex and non-agile control plane. Softwaredefined networking is emerging as a natural solution for next generation cellular networks as it enables further network function virtualization opportunities and network programmability. In this article, we advocate an all-SDN network architecture with hierarchical network control capabilities to allow for different grades of performance and complexity in offering core network services and provide service differentiation for 5G systems. As a showcase of this architecture, we introduce a unified approach to mobility, handoff, and routing management and offer connectivity management as a service (CMaaS). CMaaS is offered to application developers and over-the-top service providers to provide a range of options in protecting their flows against subscriber mobility at different price levels.",

   "abstract": "The telecommunications sector has experienced significant changes over the past few years. The advent and rise of new applications and services, together with a competitive market, has led to a complex scenario in which quality of service plays a major role. Under this condition, novel QoS regulation and standardization initiatives are required. During the last few years new terms and concepts, such as quality of experience or QoS perceived, have been included in the updated and new QoS-related standards as to better integrate the user's point of view, as opposed to only network performance parameters. The influence of the user's satisfaction on the quality of business has also been given increased attention in the regulation and standardization bodies recently. The result is a loose collection of metrics and models that are not standardized and do not integrate all aspects of quality. Such integration is necessary to assure the successful development of this sector. This paper presents a new and integrated QoS model (QoXphere) that is spherical, adaptive, and multi-layered.",

   "abstract": "Recently, a number of approaches based on dynamic power management techniques have been proposed to reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks and devices. They are able to optimize the trade-off between network performance and energy requirements. It is possible to execute and extend these techniques to the whole network, by using local control policies together with energy-aware routing and traffic engineering. However, the lack of a standardized representation of the energy-aware capabilities of heterogeneous networking equipment makes their deployment confusing and impractical. To this aim, we have proposed a novel framework, the green abstraction layer (GAL), whose purpose is to define a multi-layered abstraction interface for the hardware and physical resources, where energy management actions are directly performed. Therefore, the GAL syntax can be exposed to the platform-independent logical representation commonly used in network control protocols. Given the internal architectural complexity and heterogeneity of many network devices, the GAL approach is based on a hierarchical decomposition, where each level provides an abstract and aggregated representation of internal components.",

This article provides a working definition of \"coherent transmission\" based on current market realities; provides a functional model for beyond 100G coherent systems, and then examines five key technologies that will deliver beyond 100G: evolving transmitter technologies, including Nyquist pulse shaping and nonlinear compensation of transmitter devices; nonlinear compensation for the propagation effect; further advances in FEC technology; flexible grid DWDM and coherent super-channels. In each case we explain the factors in terms of optical or electronic component performance that are most likely to result in system performance limitations, and discuss engineering strategies to mitigate those limitations.",

The main trait that differentiates M2M from other variations of communications is the lack of human supervision in the communications lifecycle. However, increased automation resulted in many heterogeneous novel applications taking advantage of M2M. This eventually caused an explosion in the number of devices participating in M2M. Therefore, managing the massive number of accesses to satisfy the QoS requirements of the different applications running on those devices has become an issue of great concern. In this article, we survey the existing access management approaches for M2M communication, aiming at a novel classification scheme that will serve as a guide and motivation toward further research in this area.",

   "abstract": "The ever increasing technological advances in embedded systems engineering, together with the proliferation of small-size sensor designs and deployment, have enabled smart devices to recognize daily human-based actions, activities, and interactions. Therefore, inferring a vast variety of user-device-based activities from diverse contexts obtained by a series of sensory observations has drawn much interest to the research area of ubiquitous sensing. The existence and awareness of context provides the capability of being conscious of physical environments or situations around users, and this allows network services to respond proactively and intelligently based on such awareness. Hence, with the evolution of smartphones, software developers have been empowered to create context-aware applications for recognizing human-centric or community based innovative social and cognitive activities in any situation and at any location. However, the middleware services provided in mobile devices have limited resources in terms of power, memory, and bandwidth compared to the capabilities of PCs and servers. Also, power is a major restriction on implementation of context-aware applications. Mobile device batteries do not last a long time while operating sensor(s) constantly. To this end, this article extensively surveys the emerging concepts of context awareness in mobile platforms by providing up-to-date literature and future research directives. We also point out the challenges faced in this regard and enlighten them by offering possible solutions.",

A notable advantage of these novel networking architectures is to provide transparent and ubiquitous in-network caching to speed up content distribution and improve network resource utilization. With the explosive increase of global network traffic, the energy efficiency issue in ICN is a growing concern. In this article, we provide a brief survey of energy-efficient caching techniques in ICN from the placement, content placement, and requestto- cache routing perspectives. We also outline some challenges and future research directions about caching policies for green ICN.",

   "abstract": "Participatory sensing, a promising sensing paradigm, enables people to collect and share sensor data on phenomena of interest using mobile devices across many applications, such as smart transportation and air quality monitoring. This article presents a framework of participatory sensing and then focuses on a key technical challenge: developing a trajectory-based recruitment strategy of social sensors in order to enable service providers to identify well suited participants for data sensing based on temporal availability, trust, and energy. To devise a basic recruitment strategy, the Dynamic Tensor Analysis algorithm is initially adopted to learn the time-series tensor of trajectory so that the users' trajectory can be predicted. To guarantee reliable sensing data collection and communication, the trust and energy factors are taken into account jointly in our multi-objective recruitment strategy. In particular, friend-like social sensors are also defined to deal with an emergency during participatory sensing. An illustrative example and experiment are conducted on a university campus to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility and extensibility of the proposed recruitment strategy.",

   "abstract": "Fifth generation wireless systems (5G) must achieve high user Quality of Experience (QoE) in order to compete for market share. Each candidate 5G wireless radio frequency (RF) band offers advantages such as longer range or higher data rate than 2G, 3G, and 4G, but no single band or air interface standard by itself fully achieves ubiquitous levels of QoE for the complete range of wireless access devices. Spectrum clearing cannot keep pace with user demand, so public-private spectrum sharing is emerging as an affordable, near-term method of increasing radio access network (RAN) capacities for content delivery. This paper presents a fresh look at QoE; spectrum scarcity; public uses that underutilize candidate 5G radio frequency (RF) spectrum; and emerging public-private radio interference management frameworks that enable near-term spectrum sharing, with positive consequences for 5G price, performance, and total user QoE.",

   "abstract": "Readers of this publication are undoubtedly familiar with the trade-offs involved in distributed vs. centralized forms of communication. The more centralized the communications, the easier it is to establish order and control, and also to make a profit. More distributed communication requires more resources, both for the communications itself, and especially to achieve consensus or any form of distributed decision making. More distributed communication has the advantage that decision making does not require approval from a central authority, and is therefore useful in cases where parties in a single network might conflict, and at least some people may disagree with (or not trust) the authority's decisions.",

This paper starts with a description of an architecture that 3GPP has defined to achieve this. It describes how a mobile device can set up an IP connection over WLAN routed via EPC without imposing new requirements on the mobile device. It also describes how more advanced features that do impose new requirements on the mobile device can be supported in an incremental fashion.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a dynamic migration planning methodology for communication networks. Aimed at providing optimal technical performance, the approach takes into account dimensioning of network infrastructure and services, as well as evaluation of revenues and costs. As a result, the migration planning method provides a cost-effective network deployment plan based on an optimal stepwise upgrade strategy. Market information, existing infrastructure, costs, and demand forecasting are then considered in order to determine this strategy by solving a combinatorial optimization problem. It is described theoretically, and a techno-economic evaluation framework is introduced to assess its financial feasibility. The model is a suitable guideline to tackle migration problems commonly solved by using anticipated, single- ,and multi-period planning techniques. Considering a particular example, a study on migration toward fiber to the home is analyzed. Fiber to the cabinet/building architectures are then proposed as possible intermediate steps in the migration path to fiber to the home. Finally, a case study for an existing access network is analyzed.",

   "abstract": "As 4G cellular systems densify their cell deployment, co-channel interference becomes a major source of obstacles to cell throughput improvement. In addition, cell edge users suffer more from co-channel interference, which may govern end users, experiences. Although some network-side solutions for co-channel interference management have been introduced in current 4G standards, it turns out that most of those solutions yield only meager gains in realistic cellular environments. In this article, we pay attention to recent advances in the network information theory and discuss the benefits of UE-side approaches. Based on this understanding, we provide our vision on advanced interference management for 5G cellular systems: network-side interference management needs to be complemented by UE-side interference management to realize true factor-one resource reuse. We also discuss practical challenges to deploy advanced interference management and their implications on 5G system design. Prospective gains of advanced interference management are demonstrated, and it is shown that the benefits of advanced receivers can be well exploited if 5G cellular networks employ elaborated joint scheduling.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, Long Term Evolution systems have been developed to replace 3G mobile networks. During LTE network deployment, it is essential that mobile operators and manufacturers conduct tests on user equipment and the base station (eNB). Besides conformance testing at the radio layer, it is also important to conduct network-layer performance tests between UE and eNB. This article develops an LTE test environment that can be used to test the IP-based packet performance for TD-LTE and LTE FDD. Specifically, we consider the latency and the throughput performance of IP, TCP, and VoIP (i.e., G.711) packet delivery. This multi-purpose test environment can be utilized to investigate the performance of the UE and/or eNBs of various manufacturers. Furthermore, we use this environment to compare TD-LTE and LTE FDD. The measurement results provide guidelines for UE and eNB vendors to improve their products, and operators to deploy their LTE networks and subsidized UE devices.",

Converging the cellular network with Wi-Fi is a reasonable way to support the increasing mobile traffic because most mobile user terminals already have Wi-Fi interfaces. More opportunities for Wi-Fi use require further enhancement of system capacity and manageability, especially in the high-density Wi-Fi network. This is because the chronic depletion of system resources is becoming a significant problem in the Wi-Fi network given the increases in Wi-Fi density and traffic. This article introduces a Wi- Fi data service platform coupled with cellular networks, which strengthens the synergy of two networks. Enhanced monitoring and performance prediction are essential to provide a highgrade user experience in high-density Wi-Fi environments.",

We first survey the state-of-the-art on spectrum efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), and quality of service (QoS) based mobile association, multi-layer interference management and power control, network wide cooperation and dynamic resource allocation for heterogeneous wireless networks. We also present the system framework of cooperative green heterogeneous networks, which aims at balancing and optimizing SE, EE, and QoS in heterogeneous wireless networks. We discuss the design principles and show some preliminary performance results on the tradeoffs among SE, EE, and QoS. Finally, we identify the technical challenges that remain in the cooperative green heterogeneous network design. The presented wireless system framework is expected to advance the understandings of the critical technical issues toward energy and spectrum efficient 5G wireless communication systems.",

In principle, exploiting direct communication between nearby mobile devices will improve spectrum utilization, overall throughput, and energy consumption, while enabling new peer-to-peer and location-based applications and services. D2D-enabled LTE devices can also become competitive for fallback public safety networks, which must function when cellular networks are not available or fail. Introducing D2D poses many challenges and risks to the long-standing cellular architecture, which is centered around the base station. We provide an overview of D2D standardization activities in 3GPP, identify outstanding technical challenges, draw lessons from initial evaluation studies, and summarize \"best practices\" in the design of a D2D-enabled air interface for LTE-based cellular networks.",

   "abstract": "Recently serious natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, and hurricanes have occurred at many places around the world. The East Japan Great Earthquake on March 11, 2011 had more than 19,000 victims and destroyed a huge number of houses, buildings, loads, and seaports over the wide area of Northern Japan. Information networks and systems and electric power lines were also severely damaged by the great tsunami. Functions such as the highly developed information society, and residents' safety and trust were completely lost. Thus, through the lessons from this great earthquake, a more robust and resilient information network has become one of the significant subjects. In this article, our information network recovery activity in the aftermath of the East Japan Great Earthquake is described. Then the problems of current information network systems are analyzed to improve our disaster information network and system through our network recovery activity. Finally we suggest the systems and functions required for future large-scale disasters.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we present a new scheme to improve the performance of multiservice WDM/OCDM-based core networks. The idea is based on utilizing optical multilevel transmission technique (MLTT) to mitigate the multiple access interference (MAI) effect of OCDM. In this multilevel-multiclass network, users of each class are divided into multiple groups and users of each group are allowed to transmit at a specific power level. We demonstrate that, the proposed multilevel-multiservice scheme outperforms previously introduced multiservice WDM/OCDM based networks. This is due to the interference reduction property of MLTT, and this superiority can be further enhanced by using advanced optical logic gates. The proposed scheme is a modification implemented at the data plane by upgrading the intermediate optical routers to support MLTT. In the proposed network model, data and control planes are separated and can be designed independently. However, our results reveal that a data-planeaware controlling approach, which considers the information of the data plane, outperforms a data-plane-unaware algorithm in terms of average error probability.",

To this end, we extract key functionalities expected in an MAV network. We map these functionalities into building blocks to characterize the expected communication needs. Based on insights from our own and related real-world experiments, we discuss the capabilities of existing communications technologies and their limitations to implement the proposed building blocks. Our findings indicate that while certain requirements of MAV applications are met with available technologies, further research and development is needed to address the scalability, heterogeneity, safety, quality of service, and security aspects of multi- MAV systems.",

   "abstract": "Self-interference cancellation invalidates a long-held fundamental assumption in wireless network design that radios can only operate in half duplex mode on the same channel. Beyond enabling true in-band full duplex, which effectively doubles spectral efficiency, self-interference cancellation tremendously simplifies spectrum management. Not only does it render entire ecosystems like TD-LTE obsolete, it enables future networks to leverage fragmented spectrum, a pressing global issue that will continue to worsen in 5G networks. Self-interference cancellation offers the potential to complement and sustain the evolution of 5G technologies toward denser heterogeneous networks and can be utilized in wireless communication systems in multiple ways, including increased link capacity, spectrum virtualization, any-division duplexing (ADD), novel relay solutions, and enhanced interference coordination. By virtue of its fundamental nature, self-interference cancellation will have a tremendous impact on 5G networks and beyond.",

   "abstract": "With more and more activities taking place online, concern over the environmental impact of digital services has drawn attention to the energy intensity of the network. Estimating the network energy intensity has been the subject of research for some time but results have differed widely, thus weakening the robustness of any conclusions drawn from assessments. A review of past studies shows two separate communities at work, applying different methods and assumptions. In this article we consider the approaches of top-down and bottom-up modeling. Top-down models have in the past usually given higher estimates of energy intensity than bottom-up models. We find that among the main reasons for the difference are varying system boundaries, and assumptions on the number and energy efficiency of routers and optical transmission equipment. Through application of consistent system boundaries around the metro and core networks and excluding access networks and customer equipment, we reduce the difference between the energy intensity estimates of the alternative approaches. Additionally, we review the varying assumptions in existing bottom-up models and combine them in a meta-model. Through Monte Carlo simulation over the distributions behind the varying assumptions we provide a more robust estimate of approximate energy efficiency for networks of 0.02 kWh/Gbyte that can be used in the environmental impact assessment of digital services.",

   "abstract": "This article introduces new methods for evaluating and improving resilience of network connectivity to attacks on nodes of the network. Network connectivity is evaluated using a centrality measure that quantifies sensitivity of the size of the largest connected component to node removals. Based on this centrality measure, a new method for improving resilience is introduced, called edge rewiring. The topology of the power grid of western U.S. states is used to illustrate the proposed method. Using the proposed centrality measure, we show that the power grid topology is especially vulnerable to nodal attacks. In particular, using the proposed centrality measure, an attacker could reduce the largest component size by nearly a factor of two by only targeting 0.2 percent of the nodes. More importantly, we show that network resilience can be greatly improved via a few edge rewires without introducing additional edges in the network.",

In this article we formally define and frame such areas as Internet Bad Neighborhoods. By extending the reputation of malicious IP addresses to their neighbors, the bad neighborhood approach ultimately enables attack prediction from unforeseen addresses. We investigate spam and phishing bad neighborhoods, and show how their underlying business models, counter-intuitively, influences the location of the neighborhoods (both geographically and in the IP addressing space). We also show how bad neighborhoods are highly concentrated at a few Internet Service Providers and discuss how our findings can be employed to improve current network and spam filters and incentivize botnet mitigation initiatives.",

   "abstract": "In recent years the Internet has evolved into a critical communication infrastructure that is omnipresent in almost all aspects of our daily life. This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.",

   "abstract": "Near-surface wave propagation at microwave frequencies, especially 2 GHz and above, shows significant dependence on atmospheric ducts that are the layer in which rapid decrease in the refractive index occurs. The propagating signals in the atmospheric ducts are trapped between the ducting layer and the sea surface, so that the power of the propagating signals do not spread isotropically through the atmosphere. As a result, these signals have low path loss and can travel over the horizon. Since atmospheric ducts are nearly permanent in maritime and coastal environments, ducting layer communication is a promising method for b-LoS communications especially in naval communications. To this end, we overview the characteristics and the channel modeling approaches for ducting layer communications by outlining possible open research areas. In addition, we review the possible utilization of the ducting layer in network-centric operations to empower decision making for the b-LoS operations.",

   "abstract": "Cooperative communication can increase the throughput and/or extend the coverage of wireless networks. However, in conventional cooperative networks, half-duplex relays transmit and receive under a prefixed schedule, which does not allow them to exploit the best receiving and transmitting channels, thus limiting performance. Recently, new protocols have been proposed that circumvent this problem by making use of the additional flexibility offered by relays with buffers. Compared to conventional relaying protocols, these buffer-aided protocols provide significant gains in terms of throughput, diversity, and signal-to-noise ratio. This article outlines several buffer-aided relaying protocols for different network topologies, including one-way single- and multi-relay networks as well as two-way single-relay networks. Moreover, some practical challenges inherent to buffer-aided relaying, such as increased delay and complexity, and topics for future research are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Testing networking devices before releasing them onto the market is a way of ensuring quality and robustness. Replaying artificial or realworld traffic is a method to test networking devices. Using real-world traffic is desirable as it uncovers more realistic properties. The challenges of testing with real-world traffic are mainly the high volume of the captured traces and the prolonged time required for replay testing. In order to efficiently reproduce the failures of networking devices and reduce the replay time, it is necessary to reduce the size of the traces that have triggered the failures. In this work, two algorithms used to downsize the traces but still retain the failures they triggered, Binary Downsizing (BD) and Linear Downsizing (LD), are proposed. Meanwhile, a metric called downsizing ratio (DR), the ratio between the size of the downsized traces and that of the original traces, is defined in order to evaluate the efficiency of the trace downsizing. Three kinds of probes following the basic RFC benchmarking requirements, ARP, ICMP, and HTTP requests, are regularly sent to diagnose the devices during the testing. ARP and ICMP probes test the reachability of a networking device hosted on the local network, and HTTP probes check if the device still responds to users' requests. The evaluation of failure distribution shows that 70 percent of failures happened because they failed to respond to one of the three probes, 23 percent failed to respond to two probes, and 7 percent failed to respond to all probes. From the downsizing experiments, LD was inferred to have a slightly higher DR than that of BD, but BD generally would require fewer iterations than LD.",

   "abstract": "Network management is achieved through a large number of disparate solutions for different technologies and parts of the end-to-end network. Gaining an overall view, and especially predicting the impact on a service user, is difficult. Recently, a number of proprietary platforms have emerged to conduct end-to-end testing from user premises; however, these are limited in scale, interoperability, and the ability to compare like-for-like results. In this article we show that these platforms share similar architectures and can benefit from the standardization of key interfaces, test definitions, information model, and protocols. We take the SamKnows platform as a use case and propose an evolution from its current proprietary protocols to standardized protocols and tests. In particular, we propose to use extensions of the IETF's IPFIX and NETCONF/YANG in the platform. Standardization will allow measurement capabilities to be included on many more network elements and user devices, providing a much more comprehensive view of user experience and enabling problems and performance bottlenecks to be identified and addressed.",

   "abstract": "Next generation cognitive radio networks require an RF and mixed signal hardware architecture that can achieve low-energy, very wideband spectrum sensing. We survey state-of-the-art low-power CMOS building blocks as potential candidates for realizing such an architecture. For the critical analog-to-digital converter, we compare time-interleaved and frequency- interleaved architectures, including system- level simulations, and frequency-interleaving is shown to provide significant advantages. Measurement results from a 3.8 mW 5 GHz bandwidth analog domain frequency interleaver are presented to confirm the possibility of a very low-energy frequency domain digitizer. Coupled with DSP for calibration and signal feature extraction, this architecture has significant promise for cognitive spectrum sensing.",

   "abstract": "Many new wireless applications such as public safety and social networking have been emerging in recent years. Those applications introduce the necessity of direct communications among devices or peers without core network or wireless routers, which is not well supported in current network infrastructures. While some existing technologies can support certain levels of direct peer-to-peer communications, they are contextoblivious and inefficient. This article proposes a context-aware proximity-based P2P (CA-P2P) wireless communication system architecture to enable context awareness for direct P2P communications. The main idea is to systematically incorporate appropriate context information in direct communication protocols to improve overall performance. One of the major features is application-based communication, which connects peers according to their common applications. Accordingly, radio resources can be managed more efficiently among and within different application groups. Specifically, the scheme proposed in this article includes several new mechanisms such as context-aware peer discovery and context-aware peer association. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed context awareness system achieves fast and efficient peer discovery and peer association in terms of latency and overhead.",

   "abstract": "One of the major challenging issues of smartphone networks is congestion control due to the limitation of node resources. In this article, we focus on exploring context knowledge between nodes to control congestion. For this purpose, we first measure the effect of context information on congestion, and specify several major congestion factors. We then model the congestion control problem as multiple criteria decision making, in which the weight of each congestion factor is measured by the CRITIC method. Subsequently, we develop a context-aware congestion control approach (CACC) to determine the forwarding set, including those messages that incur the least congestion on the network. Extensive real-trace driven simulation is conducted, and the experimental results finally validate the efficiency of our proposed CACC.",

This opens up an unprecedented opportunity to study, test, and evaluate the performance of techniques operating at different layers of the protocol stack and adopting the cognitive networking paradigm. In this article, we describe our novel IEEE 802.11 mesh network testbed that integrates Android-based devices. The aim is to build a flexible testbed to observe in-stack and out-of-stack parameters of interest that, with some modifications, can be used to test networking techniques in both civilian and emergency scenarios. We provide the implementation details to create an ad hoc network among these inexpensive commercial devices, and specify how to observe and modify the networking parameters at different layers of the protocol stack. We also run some standard protocols on the network, and we obtain some repeatable results, which are similar to other results from the literature and confirm our testbed as a valid tool for ad hoc network performance evaluation.",

   "abstract": "The demand for rich multimedia services over mobile networks has been soaring at a tremendous pace over recent years. However, due to the centralized architecture of current cellular networks, the wireless link capacity as well as the bandwidth of the radio access networks and the backhaul network cannot practically cope with the explosive growth in mobile traffic. Recently, we have observed the emergence of promising mobile content caching and delivery techniques, by which popular contents are cached in the intermediate servers (or middleboxes, gateways, or routers) so that demands from users for the same content can be accommodated easily without duplicate transmissions from remote servers; hence, redundant traffic can be significantly eliminated. In this article, we first study techniques related to caching in current mobile networks, and discuss potential techniques for caching in 5G mobile networks, including evolved packet core network caching and radio access network caching. A novel edge caching scheme based on the concept of content-centric networking or information-centric networking is proposed. Using trace-driven simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme and validate the various advantages of the utilization of caching content in 5G mobile networks. Furthermore, we conclude the article by exploring new relevant opportunities and challenges.",

   "abstract": "The fourth generation wireless communication systems have been deployed or are soon to be deployed in many countries. However, with an explosion of wireless mobile devices and services, there are still some challenges that cannot be accommodated even by 4G, such as the spectrum crisis and high energy consumption. Wireless system designers have been facing the continuously increasing demand for high data rates and mobility required by new wireless applications and therefore have started research on fifth generation wireless systems that are expected to be deployed beyond 2020. In this article, we propose a potential cellular architecture that separates indoor and outdoor scenarios, and discuss various promising technologies for 5G wireless communication systems, such as massive MIMO, energy-efficient communications, cognitive radio networks, and visible light communications. Future challenges facing these potential technologies are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "While operators have finally started to deploy fourth generation broadband technology, many believe it will still be insufficient to meet the anticipated demand in mobile traffic over the coming years. Generally, the natural way to cope with traffic acceleration is to reduce cell size, and this can be done in many ways. The most obvious method is via picocells, but this requires additional CAPEX and OPEX investment to install and manage these new base stations. Another approach, which avoids this additional CAPEX/OPEX, involves offloading cellular traffic onto direct D2D connections whenever the users involved are in proximity. Given that most client devices are capable of establishing concurrent cellular and WiFi connections today, we expect the majority of immediate gains from this approach to come from the use of the unlicensed bands.",

   "abstract": "A new era in telecommunications is emerging. Virtualized networking functions and resources will offer network operators a way to shift the balance of expenditure from capital to operational, opening up networks to new and innovative services. This article introduces the concept of edge as a service (EaaS), a means of harnessing the flexibility of virtualized network functions and resources to enable network operators to break the tightly coupled relationship they have with their infrastructure and enable more effective ways of generating revenue. To achieve this vision, we envisage a virtualized service access interface that can be used to programmatically alter access network functions and resources available to service providers in an elastic fashion. EaaS has many technically and economically difficult challenges that must be addressed before it can become a reality; the main challenges are summarized in this article.",

Understanding the trade-off between energy efficiency, EE, and spectral efficiency, SE, in cognitive cellular networks is of fundamental importance for system design and optimization. This article presents recent research progress on the EE-SE trade-off of cognitive cellular networks. We show how EE-SE trade-off studies can be performed systematically with respect to different architectures, levels of analysis, and capacity metrics. Three representative examples are given to illustrate how EE-SE trade-off analysis can lead to important insights and useful design guidelines for future cognitive cellular networks.",

   "abstract": "Emerging nanoscale applications, e.g., nanoscale cooperative intelligent drug delivery or multiple intra-body nanosensors for health monitoring, mandate enabling nanomachines to communicate with each other, and hence, form nanonetworks to overcome the limitations of a single nanomachine. Indeed, the human body is a massive nanoscale molecular communications network composed of billions of interacting nanomachines, i.e., cells, whose functionalities depend on nanoscale molecular communications. In this paper, we first introduce the elementary models for nanoscale neuro-spike communication channels, and discuss its extensions to multi-terminal nervous system nanonetworks. Our objective is to learn from the elegant molecular communication mechanisms inside the human body to engineer practical communication techniques for emerging nanonetworks. Besides, we aim to pave the way for the advancement of revolutionary diagnosis and treatment techniques for neural diseases inspired from information and communication technologies (ICT), which is promising for future neuro-treatment and bioinspired molecular communication applications.",

   "abstract": "Light emitting diodes are low-cost and energy- efficient. They are replacing incandescent bulbs as the primary source of illumination in residential and public environments. The brightness of LEDs can be modulated at a high rate, which enables the combination of illumination and wireless communication, imperceptible to humans. Such systems using LEDs as transceivers are called visible light communication systems. LEDs have also been extensively used in consumer electronics such as toys and smartphones, but primarily for reasons other than communication. We show various use cases of devices connected with VLC. Since LEDs can also be used as light receivers in VLC systems, adding microcontrollers to devices (if not already embedded) enables low-cost implementation of a wireless communication interface with VLC. This article reports on experience with several prototypes of practical VLC systems.",

   "abstract": "There are emerging opportunities for distributed, composite services, based on the combination of smart homes, networked consumer devices, third-party services, and social, geographical or commercial collaborations. However, current home automation technology tends to focus on the single-home solution, rather than enabling home users to securely share and easily manage the resources and services of their home area network. This article describes a new federated home architecture that addresses these needs, reports on prototyping to date, and provides an overview of several important technologies for the next generation of federated homes. Our vision is to support a future of user-centric device and service sharing from home to home across the Internet, in a way that does not rely on centralized authority but supports a web of secure, peer-wise trusted relationships between consumers.",

   "abstract": "Social networking applications have gained huge popularity. With the widespread use of smart devices (e.g., on-board units, smartphones), these social networks are increasingly going mobile. As a result, a new trend of networking has emerged, referred to as vehicular social networking (VSN), which combines the wireless communications between vehicles with their social relationships. In a broader view, VSNs are social networks formed on roadways by users who have social relationships, interactions, and common interests. The exploitation of vehicular users' social properties provides better networking and social support to innovative applications and services. This article overviews recent achievements in VSN by providing an organized view of existing approaches. Its contribution lies in a taxonomy for content dissemination approaches in the context of VSN. Also, a framework is outlined to tackle a major new challenge: supporting user satisfaction. Finally, this article emphasizes open research and future trends.",

Furthermore, the communicated data, depending on their priority, require differentiated QoS, such as end-to-end delay and jitter. In this work, we use context awareness as a means of sharing information required to control the network, and providing differentiated QoS to the nodes and their transmitted data by exploiting spatial and temporal correlation. Simulation results show that context awareness helps nodes to manage the network in an energy-efficient manner.",

Recent advances in network control and management technologies, such as SDN, NFV, and service-oriented networking paradigms, are expected to make the network effectively able to cope with application service requirements in a more flexible, timely, and agile manner. In this article we discuss how NGSON, which already incorporates several aspects of virtualization, could take advantage of network virtualization mechanisms and programmable traffic steering capabilities to enhance and effectively support context-aware service composition along with adaptive service delivery. We propose an architectural model for NGSON that leverages these novel network service control capabilities and illustrate through a use case how this model could effectively be put into operation.",

This leads to an increasing evolutionary tendency to change from vehicular networks toward cloud-assisted context-aware vehicular cyberphysical systems.

Then we propose an application scenario regarding the context-aware dynamic parking services by illuminating the cloud-assisted architecture and logic flow. Finally, we investigate the challenges and possible solutions, including context-aware safety hazard prediction, context-aware dynamic vehicle routing, and context-aware vehicular clouds.",

   "abstract": "The fifth generation mobile networks will be developed to improve area spectral and energy efficiency, and provide uniform user experience. Hyper-dense small cell deployment can move devices closer to the wireless network and satisfy 5G system requirements. The main challenge of this network deployment results from the random deployment, dynamic on-off, flexible connection to cellular core networks, and flat system architecture of 5G systems. Therefore, conventional network planning and radio resource management, which depend on a central control node, cannot be applied to small cell networks. In this article some cooperative distributed radio resource management algorithms for time synchronization, carrier selection, and power control are discussed for hyper-dense small cell deployment.",

Since the interference experienced by close-by users in a cellular network is usually correlated, it can be cooperatively suppressed to improve user experience. In this article, we introduce the idea of cooperative interference cancellation (CIC) between close-by users using device-to-device (D2D) communications for the example of the upcoming 3rd Generation Partnership Program (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) Rel-12 D2D technology. We understand CIC as a new network interference management tool, capable of exploiting interference correlation to improve downlink throughput. We discuss possible deployment scenarios as well as theoretical and practical challenges. To each challenge we provide some possible solutions. Finally, a first feasibility analysis using numerical simulations is presented that demonstrates the potential gains of CIC.",

Nevertheless, wireless technologies face performance limitations due to unstable propagation conditions and mobility of devices. In face of multi-path propagation and low-data-rate stations, cooperative relaying promises gains in performance and reliability. However, cooperation procedures are unstable, due to their dependence on current channel conditions, and introduce overhead that can endanger performance, especially when nodes are mobile. This article presents an introduction to cooperative relaying, and describes a novel link layer protocol, called RelaySpot, able to implement cooperative relaying in dynamic networks, based on opportunistic relay selection, cooperative relay scheduling, and switching.",

   "abstract": "This article examines the cost implications of a network-sharing scheme for different fiber to the home/passive optical network architectures. Varied metrics are employed to understand the effect of a network-sharing arrangement on costs. The results show that for the majority of cases studied, the cost per home connected and the payback period increase when employing a network-sharing scheme, but the initial investment is strongly reduced. The reuse of existing passive infrastructure does not bring any cost advantage in comparison to the standalone scenario, but it helps to reduce the total cost per home connected.",

   "abstract": "In the soon-to-be realized IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) system, vehicles are supposed to broadcast their movement information periodically. Although this beaconing mechanism has been designed mainly to reduce the risk of vehicle crashes in various driving contexts, it can easily be exploited for implementing many other applications. In particular, applications such as traffic situation monitoring and safety message overload control can be enabled by just counting the beacons. Counter to our intuition, however, simple counting is inadequate to enumerate the real vehicle population and generally leads to underestimation. This article first sheds light on this aspect, and then discusses how it can be overcome by drawing from experiences in wild animal counting in ecological studies.",

It is not clear, however, whether both high data rates and coverage in terms of signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio can be achieved in interference-limited mmWave cellular networks due to the differences in propagation conditions and antenna topologies. This article shows that dense mmWave networks can achieve both higher data rates and comparable coverage relative to conventional microwave networks. Sum rate gains can be achieved using more advanced beamforming techniques that allow multiuser transmission. The insights are derived using a new theoretical network model that incorporates key characteristics of mmWave networks.",

Different communities have distinct features and strengths. With humans playing the bridge role, these communities are implicitly interlinked. In contrast with the existing studies that mostly consider a single community, this article addresses the interaction among distinct communities. In particular, we present an emerging research area - cross-community sensing and mining (CSM), which aims to connect heterogeneous, cross-space communities by revealing the complex linkage and interplay among their properties and identifying human behavior patterns by analyzing the data sensed/collected from multi-community environments. The article describes and discusses the research background, characters, general framework, research challenges, as well as our practice of CSM.",

The approach comprises a device to be worn by individuals, an infrastructure to collect the information from the devices, a set of algorithms for recognizing crowd dynamics, and a set of feedback strategies to intervene in the crowd. A fundamental element of our approach is to consider crowds in terms of their texture. The crowd texture is represented through the proximity graph, a data structure that captures the spatial closeness relationship between individuals over time. We address its properties and limitations, a system architecture to measure and process it, and a few examples of insights that can be obtained from analyzing it.",

In the context of MCS, end users with sensing and computing devices can share and extract information of common interest. In this article, we examine Crowd++, an MCS application that accurately estimates the number of people talking in a certain place through unsupervised machine learning analysis on audio segments captured by mobile devices. Such a technique can find application in many domains, such as crowd estimation, social sensing, and personal well being assessment. In this article, we demonstrate the utility of this technique in the context of conference room usage estimation, social diaries, and social engagement in a power-efficient manner followed by a discussion on privacy and possible optimizations to Crowd++ software.",

   "abstract": "Fiber to the premises has promised to increase the capacity in telecommunications access networks for well over 30 years. While it is widely recognized that optical-fiber-based access networks will be a necessity in the shortto medium-term future, its large upfront cost and regulatory issues are pushing many operators to further postpone its deployment, while installing intermediate unambitious solutions such as fiber to the cabinet. Such high investment cost of both network access and core capacity upgrade often derives from poor planning strategies that do not consider the necessity to adequately modify the network architecture to fully exploit the cost benefit that a fiber-centric solution can bring. DISCUS is a European Framework 7 Integrated Project that, building on optical-centric solutions such as long-reach passive optical access and flat optical core, aims to deliver a cost-effective architecture for ubiquitous broadband services. DISCUS analyzes, designs, and demonstrates end-to-end architectures and technologies capable of saving cost and energy by reducing the number of electronic terminations in the network and sharing the deployment costs among a larger number of users compared to current fiber access systems. This article describes the network architecture and the supporting technologies behind DISCUS, giving an overview of the concepts and methodologies that will be used to deliver our end-to-end network solution.",

   "abstract": "The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a critical service on the Internet: translating host names into IP addresses. Traditional DNS does not provide guarantees about authenticity and origin integrity. DNSSEC, an extension to DNS, improves this by using cryptographic signatures, at the expense of larger response messages. Some of these larger response messages experience fragmentation, and may, as a result of that, be blocked by firewalls. As a consequence, resolvers behind such firewalls will no longer receive complete responses from name servers, leading to certain Internet zones becoming unreachable because no translation into IP addresses can be performed. Our research shows that despite ongoing efforts to educate firewall and resolver administrators, as much as 10 percent of all resolvers suffer from fragmentation-related connectivity issues. Given that some major Internet companies were reluctant to adopt even a technology like IPv6 if it meant that a small percentage of their users would have connectivity issues, it is clear that we cannot rely on resolver/firewall operators alone to tackle this issue. The contribution of this article is that it a) quantifies the severity of these DNSSEC deployment problems, based on extensive measurements at a major National Research and Education Network (NREN) and backed up by validation of these findings at an independent second location, b) proposes two potential solutions at the DNS authoritative name server side, and c) validates both solutions, again based on extensive measurements on the operational network of this major NREN. The article concludes with a recommendation favoring our first solution. The first solution is relatively simple to implement and gives DNS zone operators control over this problem without having to rely on all resolver operators solving the issue",

   "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) communications allow direct communications between nodes without transmitting data via the base stations in cellular systems, which could bring significant performance improvement. Since most applications are delay-sensitive, it is very important to consider delay performance in addition to physical layer throughput for D2D communications. To improve delay performance it is necessary to dynamically control the radio resource in a cross-layer way according to both the channel fading information and the queue length information. The former allows an observation of good transmission opportunity and the latter provides the urgency of data flows. However, the resource control with delay constraints involves stochastic optimization, which is very challenging. In this article we first summarize various approaches to solve the delay-aware resource allocation problems for D2D communications. We propose a low complexity practical solution by exploiting the interference filtering property of CSMA-like MAC protocols in the D2D system. Based on the solution structure, we further discuss the implementation issues based on LTE-Advanced systems and evaluate the associated performance and complexity. Finally we discuss the choice of MAC parameters for the overall D2D system performance.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communications is taught in most electronics degree curricula worldwide, where the main focus is the theory of communications. While it is essential that students learn the theory of communications, this is not enough to prepare them for their careers in industry. This is due to the fact that there are several practical challenges in designing and implementing wireless communications systems that are overlooked when focusing only on theory. Hence, in this article we describe the main challenges in designing practical communications systems, and demonstrate how the National Instruments Universal Software Radio Peripheral can be used for introducing and educating students about these challenges.",

   "abstract": "Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPASs) are gaining more are more relevance during the last decade since more applications are being enabled by lighter planes with increasing autonomy, higher ceilings, and more powerful transmission technologies. The integration of the RPAS as part of network-centric warfare would be a very important milestone to achieve because of the huge amount of information and capabilities that all these aircrafts can incorporate into the global scheme. This integration is easier for handheld (short-range) RPASs since their communications are typically based on digital transmission like WiFi or WiMAX, but it may not be as obvious for bigger RPASs (long-range, e.g., tactical or medium/high altitude systems) because their line of sight communications are frequently based on analog transmissions. This implies indirect integration into network-centric warfare by means of the ground control station (satellite communications, when available, may suffer notorious delay for certain applications). This article presents a recent practical experience, including flight test campaigns, deploying an all- IP communication architecture into one of the most relevant Spanish tactical RPASs, the SIVA, used by both the Spanish Army and the Spanish Air Force for the last 10 years. This deployment enables cost-effective integration of this RPAS (and its natural successor, the MILANO, a medium- altitude RPAS) into the network-centric warfare by means of direct TCP/IP transmissions over a long-range digital line of sight channel combined with satellite communications for beyond line of sight operations. The proposed design includes network-level security over the radio interfaces, automatic data link selection, support of remote video terminals, and access connectivity toward external IPv6 networks.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an architecture vision to address the challenges placed on 5G mobile networks. A two-layer architecture is proposed, consisting of a radio network and a network cloud, integrating various enablers such as small cells, massive MIMO, control/user plane split, NFV, and SDN. Three main concepts are integrated: ultra-dense small cell deployments on licensed and unlicensed spectrum, under control/user plane split architecture, to address capacity and data rate challenges; NFV and SDN to provide flexible network deployment and operation; and intelligent use of network data to facilitate optimal use of network resources for QoE provisioning and planning. An initial proof of concept evaluation is presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposal. Finally, other issues that must be addressed to realize a complete 5G architecture vision are discussed.",

   "abstract": "SDN has the potential to simplify network configuration and reduce management complexity. In today\u00bfs networks control and forwarding functions are tightly coupled and embedded within each switch/router. SDN, in contrast, accumulates the control functionality in one or more dedicated network entities called controllers, which provide a unified interface to configure and control the network. Packet forwarding, on the other hand, remains the responsibility of the switches/routers. Many datacenter networks have benefited from the abstraction provided by SDN. However, in a Wide Area Network (WAN) a single controller becomes a performance bottleneck. Multiple controller solutions are proposed as a natural consequence. In this article we present the requirements, design alternatives, and a possible management architecture for a single administrative domain WA-SDN. We also discuss the functional components that should be present in a multi-controller architecture for managing WA-SDN deployments.",

To support emerging and future warfighter needs, the next generation of systems will require significant improvements to provide higher capacity, longer range, greater flexibility, and increased interoperability. Governed by domain characteristics such as long transmission ranges, low-to-medium data rates, latency constraints, and link protection needs, the air tactical domain poses several unique requirements on link and network design. Developing next-generation ATNs requires an understanding of the airborne tactical domain, including the design constraints and challenges at various layers of the network stack. In this article, we provide an overview of the unique domain characteristics of ATNs and highlight the key design challenges and research areas associated with the physical, link, and network layers.",

   "abstract": "From being a scientific curiosity only a few years ago, energy harvesting (EH) is well on its way to becoming a game-changing technology in the field of autonomous wireless networked systems. The promise of long-term, uninterrupted and self-sustainable operation in a diverse array of applications has captured the interest of academia and industry alike. Yet the road to the ultimate network of perpetual communicating devices is plagued with potholes: ambient energy is intermittent and scarce, energy storage capacity is limited, and devices are constrained in size and complexity. In dealing with these challenges, this article will cover recent developments in the design of intelligent energy management policies for EH wireless devices and discuss pressing research questions in this rapidly growing field.",

   "abstract": "The broad proliferation of mobile devices in recent years has drastically changed the means of accessing the World Wide Web. Describing a shift away from the desktop computer era for content consumption, predictions indicate that the main access of web-based content will come from mobile devices. Concurrently, the manner of content presentation has changed as well; web artifacts are allowing for richer media and higher levels of user interaction which is enabled by the increasing speeds of access networks. This article provides an overview of more than two years of high level web page characteristics by comparing the desktop and mobile client versions. Our study is the first long-term evaluation of differences as seen by desktop and mobile web browser clients. We showcase the main differentiating factors with respect to the number of web page object requests, their sizes, relationships, and web page object caching. We find that over time, initial page view sizes and number of objects increase faster for desktop versions. However, web page objects have similar sizes in both versions, though they exhibit a different composition by type of object in greater detail.",

   "abstract": "In a conventional cellular system, devices are not allowed to directly communicate with each other in the licensed cellular bandwidth and all communications take place through the base stations. In this article, we envision a two-tier cellular network that involves a macrocell tier (i.e., BS-to-device communications) and a device tier (i.e., device-to-device communications). Device terminal relaying makes it possible for devices in a network to function as transmission relays for each other and realize a massive ad hoc mesh network. This is obviously a dramatic departure from the conventional cellular architecture and brings unique technical challenges. In such a two-tier cellular system, since the user data is routed through other users' devices, security must be maintained for privacy. To ensure minimal impact on the performance of existing macrocell BSs, the two-tier network needs to be designed with smart interference management strategies and appropriate resource allocation schemes. Furthermore, novel pricing models should be designed to tempt devices to participate in this type of communication. Our article provides an overview of these major challenges in two-tier networks and proposes some pricing schemes for different types of device relaying.",

To ensure disaster victims and first responders have access to reliable local and global communication, we propose EmergeNet, a portable, rapidly deployable, small-scale cellular network. In this article, we describe EmergeNet, which addresses the challenges of emergency and disaster areas. EmergeNet provides free voice calling and text messaging within a disaster area, and enables users of unmodified GSM handsets to communicate with the outside world using the Skype VoIP network. We evaluate EmergeNet's ability to provide robust service despite high load, limited bandwidth, and software or hardware failures. EmergeNet is uniquely well suited to providing reliable, fairly allocated voice and text communication in emergency and disaster scenarios.",

While D2D communication has great potential to improve wireless system spectral and energy efficiency due to the proximity of communication parties and higher spectrum reuse gain, tremendous work is still ongoing to turn the promising technology into a reality. This article discusses D2D technical challenges as well as standards progress and important research aspects that enable D2D communications underlaying cellular networks. The key research areas addressed include interference management, multihop D2D communications, and D2D communications in heterogeneous networks. When enabling D2D communications underlaying cellular networks, D2D communications can use either cellular downlink or cellular uplink resources. The two resource sharing modes will create different interference scenarios. The performance evaluation on D2D communications underlaying cellular networks under these two different scenarios is provided.",

   "abstract": "4G Long Term Evolution is the cellular technology expected to outperform previous generations and to some extent revolutionize the experience of users by taking advantage of the most advanced radio access techniques. However, the strong dependencies between user equipment, base stations, and the Evolved Packet Core limit the flexibility, manageability, and resilience of such networks. If the communication links between UE-eNB or eNB-EPC are disrupted, mobile terminals are unable to communicate. In this article, we reshape the 4G mobile network to move toward more virtual and distributed architectures to improve disaster resilience and drastically reduce the dependency between UE, eNBs, and EPC. First, we present the flexible management entity, a distributed entity that leverages on virtualized EPC functionalities in 4G cellular systems. Second, we introduce a novel device-to-device communication scheme allowing the UE in physical proximity to communicate directly without resorting to coordination with an eNB or EPC entity.",

   "abstract": "Unexpected disasters, both naturally occurring and those caused through human actions, result in severe damage to communication infrastructure. Additionally, such events are accompanied by sharp spikes in the usage of commercially licensed spectrum, when affected victims of the tragedy attempt to transmit information about themselves and capture high bandwidth data in the form of pictures and videos. We envisage cognitive radio as a candidate solution in such situations, where the devices can identify alternate frequency bands, and opportunistically use them. In this article, we describe a network architecture called EC-CRVN composed of CR enabled vehicles that provide critical wireless connectivity to both the general public and emergency responders. We discuss the application scenarios and salient features of the EC-CRVN. We describe the existing state of the art, the research challenges involved in realizing them, and a new approach of spectrum sensing using moving vehicles that reduces errors without adding to communication overhead.",

   "abstract": "It is essential for distributed, data-intensive applications to monitor the performance of the underlying network, storage, and computational resources. Increasingly, distributed applications need performance information from multiple aggregates, and tools need to make real-time steering decisions based on the performance feedback. With increasing scale and complexity, the volume and velocity of monitoring data is increasing, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we have developed a persistent query agent (PQA) that provides real-time application and network performance feedback to clients/ applications, thereby enabling dynamic adaptations. The PQA enables federated performance monitoring by interacting with multiple aggregates and performance monitoring sources. Using a publish-subscribe framework, it sends triggers asynchronously to applications/clients when relevant performance events occur. The applications/clients register their events of interest using declarative queries and get notified by the PQA. The PQA leverages a complex event processing (CEP) framework for managing and executing the queries expressed in a standard SQL-like query language. Instead of saving all monitoring data for future analysis, PQA observes performance event streams in real time, and runs continuous queries over streams of monitoring events. In this work, we present the design and architecture of the PQA, and describe some relevant use cases.",

   "abstract": "The expansion of wireless broadband access network deployments is resulting in increased scarcity of available radio spectrum. It is very likely that in the near future, cellular technologies and wireless local area networks will need to coexist in the same unlicensed bands. However, the two most prominent technologies, LTE and Wi-Fi, were designed to work in different bands and not to coexist in a shared band. In this article, we discuss the issues that arise from the concurrent operation of LTE and Wi-Fi in the same unlicensed bands from the point of view of radio resource management. We show that Wi-Fi is severely impacted by LTE transmissions; hence, the coexistence of LTE and Wi-Fi needs to be carefully investigated. We discuss some possible coexistence mechanisms and future research directions that may lead to successful joint deployment of LTE and Wi-Fi in the same unlicensed band.",

These trade-offs are identified as QoS, fairness, PU interference, network architecture, and security, which are also essential network design dimensions.

   "abstract": "With the explosive growth of wireless multimedia applications and the demand for high data rate, improving the spectrum and energy efficiencies have been two most critical challenges for wireless communication networks under the background of limited spectrum and energy resources. Cognitive radio and OFDM/OQAM have emerged as two exciting technologies to solve the spectrum scarcity in future cellular networks; thus, energy-efficient communications have attracted increasing attention in cognitive radio networks. In this article, we consider how to make an energy-efficient physical layer design for non-contiguous (NC) OFDM/OQAM-based cognitive radio networks. Specifically, we propose a criterion on how to reduce the high PAPR of NC-OFDM/OQAM signals to achieve high power efficiency. The key idea of the proposed criterion is to jointly reduce the PAPR and suppress the sidelobe in NCOFDM/ OQAM-based CR systems. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed criterion can provide both significant PAPR reduction and sidelobe suppression, resulting in prominent improvement of energy efficiency in NC-OFDM/OQAM-based cognitive radio networks.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radio technology can significantly improve spectrum utilization efficiency via enabling secondary users to access licensed spectrum dynamically without harmful interference to primary users. Most existing works on cognitive radio networks were focused on enhancing spectrum efficiency using spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, and network deployment schemes. However, the energy efficiency issue was largely ignored. Thus, the dilemma between high energy consumption by fast-growing wireless communications and fewer global energy resources has motivated research on energy-efficient cognitive radio networks for enhancing spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency simultaneously. In this article, we overview energy-efficient non-cooperative cognitive radio networks from the micro, meso, and macro perspectives, where the micro view means how to design energy-efficient spectrum sensing algorithms for each individual secondary user, the meso view means how to coordinate non-cooperative secondary users to share spectrum efficiently, and the macro view means how to deploy cognitive radio networks in an energy-efficient approach.",

   "abstract": "Due to the ever increasing data traffic demands, which are directly connected to increased energy consumption, it becomes challenging for operators to achieve capacity enhancement while limiting their electric bill. To that end, exploiting the context awareness of future cognitive networks is expected to play a key role. Next generation cellular networks are about to include a plethora of small cells, with users being able to communicate via multiple bands. Given that small cells are expected to be eventually as close as 50 m apart, not all of them will have a direct connection to the core network; thus, multihop communication through neighboring small cells may be required. In such architectures, the user association problem becomes challenging, with backhaul energy consumption being a definitive parameter. Thus, in this article, we study the user association problem in cognitive heterogeneous networks. We evaluate the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency and show the potential of exploiting the available context-aware information (i.e., users' measurements and requirements, knowledge of the network architecture, and the available spectrum resources of each base station) to associate the users in an energy-efficient way, while maintaining high spectrum efficiency. Our study considers both the access network and backhaul energy consumption, while the performance of the association algorithms is evaluated under two different case study scenarios.",

In this context, we present competitive network configurations, namely, femto-on-edge, DA-one-dge, relay-on-edge, and D2D-communication on- edge, where femto base stations, DA elements, relay base stations, and D2D communication, respectively, are deployed around the edge of the macrocell. The proposed deployments ensure performance gains in the network in terms of spectral efficiency and power consumption by facilitating the cell-edge mobile users with small-cells and D2D communication. In order to calibrate the impact of power consumption on system performance and network topology, this article discusses the detailed breakdown of the end-to-end power consumption, which includes backhaul, access, and aggregation network power consumptions. Several comparative simulation results quantify the improvements in spectral efficiency and power consumption of the D2D-communication-on-edge configuration to establish a greener network over the other competitive configurations.",

   "abstract": "The Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, which was the fourth strongest earthquake ever recorded in the world's history, severely damaged telecommunication facilities in unprecedented ways. The large-scale earthquake and tsunami affected many exchange office buildings and facilities. Further damage to services was caused due to the depletion of batteries associated with the prolonged disruption of the commercial power supply. The tremendous disaster caused service disruption to the communications infrastructure; in the case of NTT's facilities, approximately 1.5 million circuits for fixed lines and 4900 mobile base stations stopped working due to direct damage by the earthquake and/or tsunami or subsequent blackouts. However, more than 90 percent of the affected exchange offices and mobile base station equipment was restored by the end of March through an all-out effort by over 11,000 people. Even by the end of April, in areas where customers currently reside, service restoration has mostly been completed except for some areas experiencing construction difficulties, including damaged roads which made it difficult for workers to approach the site. In parallel with the restoration effort, a disaster emergency message service for voice, mobile, and the Internet was quickly provided in order to permit safety confirmation. The NTT Group installed temporary public telephones and Internet access environments, and also lent mobile phones, satellite mobile phones, and tablets free of charge to the affected people and government agencies. Since communication services are vital in modern society, we are making every effort to implement better countermeasures with future disasters in mind.",

   "abstract": "The growing ubiquity and pervasiveness of sensors and smart devices, with the consequent availability of a large amount of \"local\" and contextualized information, are giving rise to a wealth of \"context-aware\" applications and services. In this work we consider an opportunistic communication scheme called Floating Content (FC), which was specifically designed for serverless distributed context-aware applications. So far, the performance analysis of FC, and in particular of content lifetime and availability, was based on simplified system models and fluid system analysis. The resulting performance estimates did not account for the effects of propagation characteristics, mobility patterns, and communication protocols, all factors known to significantly affect the performance of opportunistic communication schemes. This article studies the main issues related to the performance of FC service in a realistic office setting through a first experimental evaluation of a mobile app for Android devices. Our experimental results confirm the feasibility of FC service for supporting practical context-aware mobile applications in office settings.",

   "abstract": "Molecular communication is a relatively new communication paradigm for nanomachines where the communication is realized by utilizing existing biological components found in nature. In recent years researchers have proposed using bacteria to realize molecular communication because the bacteria have the ability to swim and migrate between locations, carry DNA contents (i.e. plasmids) that could be utilized for information storage, and interact and transfer plasmids to other bacteria (one of these processes is known as bacterial conjugation). However, current proposals for bacterial nanonetworks have not considered the internal structures of the nanomachines that can facilitate the use of bacteria as an information carrier. This article presents the types and functionalities of nanomachines that can be utilized in bacterial nanonetworks. A particular focus is placed on the bacterial conjugation and its support for multihop communication between nanomachines. Simulations of the communication process have also been evaluated, to analyze the quantity of bits received as well as the delay performances. Wet lab experiments have also been conducted to validate the bacterial conjugation process. The article also discusses potential applications of bacterial nanonetworks for cancer monitoring and therapy.",

However, the flourishing of multimedia services is still hindered by inherent security and privacy concerns. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy issues of multimedia services by studying a newly emerging multimedia-oriented mobile social network (MMSN), which helps users receive multimedia services not only from their online social communities but also from their social friends in the vicinity. Specifically, we first define the MMSN architecture, and identify the unique security and privacy challenges. Then we study three MMSN applications: content query, service evaluation, and content filtering. For each application, we present the specific security and privacy problems with the corresponding countermeasures. Finally, we propose some future research directions in the MMSN.",

   "abstract": "A wireless sensor network is liable to suffer faults for several reasons, which include faulty nodes or even the fact that nodes have been destroyed by a natural disaster, such as a flood. These faults can give rise to serious problems if WSNs do not have a reconfiguration mechanism at execution. It should be noted that many WSNs designed to detect natural disasters are deployed in inhospitable places and depend on multihop communication to allow the data to reach a sink node. As a result, a fault in a single node can leave a part of the system inoperable until the node recovers from this failure. In light of this, this article outlines a solution that entails employing unmanned aerial vehicles to reduce the problems arising from faults in a sensor network when monitoring natural disasters like floods and landslides. In the solution put forward, UAVs can be transported to the site of the disaster to mitigate problems caused by faults (e.g., by serving as routers or even acting as a data mule). Experiments conducted with real UAVs and with our WSN-based prototype for flood detection (already deployed in S\u00e3o Carlos, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, have proven that this is a viable approach.",

   "abstract": "The telecommunication community has reached a broad consensus on the vision that future transport architecture will be dominated by optical in combination with IP. This implies a complete reassignment of the functions traditionally handled by legacy intermediate layers to packet and optical layers only. Here, current advances in photonic technologies and architectures enable the optical layer to become the ideal companion of the packet world and to unlock an effective packet offload toward flexible and dynamic optical pipes. A global crosslayer optimization is needed to minimize the misalignment between cost and revenues, and manage the rising tide of IP traffic. In this article, we describe this evolving path and explore the impact on network planning and traffic provisioning, also considering implications on the cloud scenario and sighting the software defined networks horizon.",

   "abstract": "In 4G cellular networks, both the adaptation of data rates to current interference conditions due to adaptive modulation and coding as well as a frequency reuse of one mandate precise techniques to estimate cell capacities and cell loads in order to accurately predict the quality of service delivered to end users. Such estimation happens ideally already during the network planning phase and is further required for self-optimization at runtime. Classic flow-level techniques to estimate cell loads, capacities, and related quality of service metrics assume static and worst case interference, which is analytically simple, but may produce considerable errors and lead to disadvantageous planning and optimization results. Appropriate models where individual cells are coupled through interference are rendered analytically intractable. This article first introduces basic flow-level modeling techniques and then reviews recent results in the field of flow-level network models, which allow the actual loads and capacities in interference- coupled wireless networks to be bound and closely approximated. We discuss trade-offs between accuracy and numerical complexity of different techniques and identify a model based on the notion of average interference as the most practically relevant. Simulation results for a large scenario based on a real network illustrate its applicability to practical network planning.",

   "abstract": "Social networking concepts have been applied to several communication network settings, which span from delay-tolerant to peer-to-peer networks. More recently, one can observe a flourish of proposals aimed at giving social-like capabilities to the objects in the Internet of Things. Such proposals address the design of conceptual (and software) platforms, which can be exploited to easily develop and implement complex applications that require direct interactions among objects. The major goal is to build techniques that allow the network to enhance the level of trust between objects that are \"friends\" with each other. Furthermore, a social paradigm could definitely guarantee network navigability even if the number of nodes becomes orders of magnitude higher than in the traditional Internet. Objectives of this article are to analyze the major opportunities arising from the integration of social networking concepts into the Internet of Things, present the major ongoing research activities, and point out the most critical technical challenges.",

   "abstract": "As CMOS single-chip radios enter the era of big data, techniques to acquire, communicate, and store sensor data will evolve to address new demands placed by a rapidly changing application space. Research and development on wireless sensor radio communication over the past decade has been largely focused on energy efficiency for short-range communication. However, going forward, sensor radios will require new modes of communication, which include leveraging existing network infrastructure and increasing the communication range of a single device. This article overviews several existing approaches for wirelessly communicating sensor data, followed by potential future strategies to enhance range and connectivity using single-chip wireless sensor transceivers. As an example of devices for longrange sensor communication, a regulator-less CMOS power amplifier specifically tailored for the demands of longer-range sensor data communication is described. This PA was designed to provide a fixed high-output power using a dynamic voltage supply as commonly found in sensor applications where an energy storage element (super capacitor) supplies the transceiver. The PA system is integrated in a 90 nm CMOS process, has a peak output power of 24 dBm, with an efficiency of 12 percent at 1.8 GHz, making this device suitable for data communication over distances of several hundred meters. As the PA supply varies from 2.5 to 1.5 V, the power control loop maintains a constant output power with an accuracy of \u00b10.8 dB.",

   "abstract": "The widespread proliferation of mobile devices has motivated Device-to-Device (D2D) communications as a means of cell offloading toward better Quality of Service (QoS) and higher energy efficiency. Although Wi-Fi networks have the lion's share regarding the D2D communications in the unlicensed spectrum, it is uncertain whether they constitute the best option as technology evolves. In particular, the increasing transmission data rates, the novel interference cancelation techniques, as well as the potential of centralized network support, stress the need for new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, especially in content dissemination scenarios where all nodes share the same goal. In this article we study the suitability of Wi-Fi technology in content dissemination scenarios with multiple available source nodes, and we propose two energy-aware game theoretic MAC strategies (a distributed and a network-assisted) as possible alternatives. Our simulation results show the effectiveness and the flexibility of our proposed solutions, highlighting the necessity for new MAC designs.",

   "abstract": "As 4G wireless networks are vastly and rapidly deployed worldwide, 5G with its advanced vision of all connected world and zero distance communications is already at the corner. Along with the super quality of user experience brought by these new networks, the shockingly increasing energy consumption of wireless networks has become a worrying economic issue for operators and a big challenge for sustainable development. Green Transmission Technologies (GTT) is a project focusing on the energy-efficient design of physical-layer transmission technologies and MAC-layer radio resource management in wireless networks. In particular, fundamental tradeoffs between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency have been identified and explored for energy-efficiency-oriented design and optimization. In this article, four selected GTT solutions are introduced, focusing on how they utilize the degrees of freedom in different resource domains, as well as how they balance the tradeoff between energy and spectrum efficiency. On top of the elaboration of separated solutions, the GTT toolbox is introduced as a systematic tool and unified simulation platform to integrate the proposed GTT solutions together.",

   "abstract": "Global research collaborations today require reliable and secure dedicated network connections to facilitate data communications between collaborating partners. To deal with the deluge of data, dedicated connections are needed to transport data in a highly efficient manner. Managing such links, which often cross multiple administrative domains with heterogeneous infrastructure, poses many compelling research challenges, one of which is interdomain network monitoring. In this article, a multidomain circuit monitoring system, CMon, is introduced. Using some services of G\u00c9ANT perfSONAR MDM, CMon is able to provide end-to-end circuit monitoring services with great flexibility, extensibility, and vendor independence, regardless of the underlying circuit provisioning systems. The architecture of CMon, by using measurement federations, can adapt to either changes in the circuit provisioning system or expansion of network size.",

Utilizing wide bandwidth in high frequency is the most efficient way of guaranteeing the explosive data demands. In spite of the notable advancements of RF technologies at millimeter wave, the relatively high propagation loss remains problematic. The authors present efficient beamforming technology to mitigate this challenge. In this article, we first discuss the principles and major applications of beamforming technology. Afterward, we present the challenges for optimizing the efficiency of beamforming as well as the solutions to tackle them by proposing enhanced algorithms and advanced design architectures based on our hands-on experience and knowledge. Lastly, experimental results are discussed to deduce insight and vision of future Wi-Fi.",

   "abstract": "With the ratification of the IEEE 802.11ad amendment to the 802.11 standard in December 2012, a major step has been taken to bring consumer wireless communication to the millimeter wave band. However, multi-gigabit-per-second throughput and small interference footprint come at the price of adverse signal propagation characteristics, and require a fundamental rethinking of Wi-Fi communication principles. This article describes the design assumptions taken into consideration for the IEEE 802.11ad standard and the novel techniques defined to overcome the challenges of mm-Wave communication. In particular, we study the transition from omnidirectional to highly directional communication and its impact on the design of IEEE 802.11ad.",

   "abstract": "The present article introduces VLC for automotive applications using an image sensor. In particular, V2I-VLC and V2V-VLC are presented. While previous studies have documented the effectiveness of V2I and V2V communication using radio technology in terms of improving automotive safety, in the present article, we identify characteristics unique to image-sensor-based VLC as compared to radio wave technology. The two primary advantages of a VLC system are its line-of-sight feature and an image sensor that not only provides VLC functions, but also the potential vehicle safety applications made possible by image and video processing. Herein, we present two ongoing image-sensor-based V2I-VLC and V2VVLC projects. In the first, a transmitter using an LED array (which is assumed to be an LED traffic light) and a receiver using a high-framerate CMOS image sensor camera is introduced as a potential V2I-VLC system. For this system, real-time transmission of the audio signal has been confirmed through a field trial. In the second project, we introduce a newly developed CMOS image sensor capable of receiving highspeed optical signals and demonstrate its effectiveness through a V2V communication field trial. In experiments, due to the high-speed signal reception capability of the camera receiver using the developed image sensor, a data transmission rate of 10 Mb/s has been achieved, and image (320 \u00d7 240, color) reception has been confirmed together with simultaneous reception of various internal vehicle data, such as vehicle ID and speed.",

   "abstract": "Virtual traffic lights (VTL) is a new technology that holds the promise of revolutionizing traffic control in urban areas. The original VTL idea was based on 100 percent penetration of VTL technology. In this article, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is shown that 100 percent penetration is not a necessary condition for deploying VTL technology as it can be implemented with partial or low levels of penetration. Furthermore, based on game-theoretic arguments, it is shown that the adoption of VTL technology can be accelerated by providing incentives to vehicles equipped with VTL technology.",

   "abstract": "The allocation of a large amount of bandwidth by regulating bodies in the 70/80 GHz band, that is, the E-band, has opened up new potentials and challenges for providing affordable and reliable gigabit-per-second wireless point-to-point links. This article first reviews the available bandwidth and licensing regulations in the E-band. Subsequently, different propagation models (e.g., the ITU-R and Cane models) are compared against measurement results, and it is concluded that to meet specific availability requirements, E-band wireless systems may need to be designed with larger fade margins compared to microwave systems. A similar comparison is carried out between measurements and models for oscillator phase noise. It is confirmed that phase noise characteristics, which are neglected by the models used for narrowband systems, need to be taken into account for the wideband systems deployed in the E-band. Next, a new MIMO transceiver design, termed continuous aperture phased (CAP)-MIMO, is presented. Simulations show that CAP-MIMO enables E-band systems to achieve fiber-optic-like throughputs. Finally, it is argued that full-duplex relaying can be used to greatly enhance the coverage of E-band systems without sacrificing throughput, thus facilitating their application in establishing the backhaul of heterogeneous networks.",

As a result, long planning cycles are used to upgrade the network and prepare it for the next planning period. Aimed at guaranteeing that the network can support the forecast traffic and deal with failure scenarios, spare capacity is usually installed, thus increasing network expenditures. Moreover, results from network capacity planning are manually deployed in the network, which limits the network agility. In this article, we propose a control and management architecture to allow the network to be dynamically operated. Employing those dynamicity capabilities, the network can be reconfigured and reoptimized in response to traffic changes in an automatic fashion; hence, the resource overprovisioning can be minimized and overall network costs reduced.",

   "abstract": "The increasing mobile data demand and the proliferation of advanced handheld devices place user-provided networks in a conspicuous position for next-generation network architectures. There has been growing consensus that user-provided networks can play a crucial role in both self-organizing and operator-controlled wireless networks, as they enable the exploitation of the diverse communication needs and resources of different users. However, in user-provided networks both the availability of and demand for Internet access depend on mobile devices; therefore, the success of such networks relies on active user participation. In this article, we analyze the design challenges of incentive mechanisms for encouraging user engagement in user-provided networks. Motivated by recently launched business models, we focus on mobile user-provided networks where the energy consumption and data usage costs are critical and have a large impact on users' decisions on both requesting and offering user-provided network services. We outline two novel incentive schemes that have been proposed for such user-provided networks, and discuss the open issues that must be further addressed.",

   "abstract": "Portable wireless devices used in close proximity to the human body have transmitter power constraints that are dictated in part by regulatory limits on a form of electromagnetic exposure called specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR, measured in Watts per kilogram, is a measure of electromagnetic energy absorption by the body, which can cause the heating of tissue. Some portable wireless devices sold today operate near the accepted human SAR limit. This article examines how SAR constraints can be incorporated into wireless signal design for multiple transmitters. A SAR constraint, although related to a power constraint, differs sufficiently that signals designed specifically for the constraint are needed. Although it is well known that multiple transmitters subject only to a power constraint can improve the link performance of a wireless system compared to a single transmitter, it is not clear when the device is also subject to a SAR constraint: how to model the constraint; whether performance advantages still exist; and how to realize any advantages. In this article, we introduce SAR constraints and discuss the SAR measurement, simulation, and modeling process. We then show how to incorporate the SAR constraint into system performance analysis and code design. We show how SAR codes use multiple transmit antennas to get good combined farfield error performance and near-field SAR performance, improving handset transmitter performance in the critical uplink of a communication system.",

   "abstract": "In September 2013, leading experts in intervehicle communication from all over the world met at the renowned Dagstuhl Castle for a seminar discussing the question \"Inter-Vehicular Communication - Quo Vadis?\" The objective was to identify the current state of the art and, more important, the open challenges in R&amp;D from both a scientific and an industrial point of view. After more than a decade of research on vehicular networks, the experts very seriously asked whether additional research in this field is necessary and, if so, which will be the most intriguing and innovative research directions. It turned out that the overall perspective has changed in the last few years, mainly as a result of the ongoing field operational tests in the United States and Europe. In this article, we report the key outcomes and results from the discussions, pointing to new research directions and new challenges that need to be met for a second generation of vehicular networking applications and protocols. In particular, we present the reports and findings from the four working groups on scientific foundations of vehicular networking, field operational tests, IVC applications, and heterogeneous vehicular networks.",

   "abstract": "The term Software Defined Networking (SDN) is prevalent in today's discussion about future communication networks. As with any new term or paradigm, however, no consistent definition regarding this technology has formed. The fragmented view on SDN results in legacy products being passed off by equipment vendors as SDN, academics mixing up the attributes of SDN with those of network virtualization, and users not fully understanding the benefits. Therefore, establishing SDN as a widely adopted technology beyond laboratories and insular deployments requires a compass to navigate the multitude of ideas and concepts that make up SDN today. The contribution of this article represents an important step toward such an instrument. It gives a thorough definition of SDN and its interfaces as well as a list of its key attributes. Furthermore, a mapping of interfaces and attributes to SDN use cases is provided, highlighting the relevance of the interfaces and attributes for each scenario. This compass gives guidance to a potential adopter of SDN on whether SDN is in fact the right technology for a specific use case.",

   "abstract": "ITU is the oldest intergovernmental and world telecommunication organization and UN specialized agency for telecommunications. Its federal structure is a historic property from those days when the political environment imposed it over any other, possibly more rational model. Together with the Union's membership segmentation into five (5) politico/geographical zones (in 1947), the \u201cfederalism\u201e was fixed for several decades. It was a perfect reflection of the emerging new world order as well as defense of strategic national interests. In the 90s, the political environment changed together with the telecommunication environment and the client' needs - the Member States recognized it but it was too early to replace the archaic federalism with a healthy pragmatism! The organizational reforms were put on \u201cstandby.\u201d With technology convergence and the need for streamlining the creative potential, the federal mechanism has become less appropriate and less responsive. The tension between the political and technical part of the ITU has led to regression of its credibility and loss of preeminence. Some Governments of Member States have noted that they are no more the leading architect of the ICT future. The political wisdom and courage are necessary to review the ITU corporate activities and to open a debate on constitutional changes at the first next Plenipotentiary Conference in 2014 (Busan, Korea). It will be important in the future to preserve a balance of interests contrary to the balance of power. Governments and non-governmental entities \u2014 sector members - should find in ITU \"a Forum\" where the national telecommunication policies get their international recognition.",

   "abstract": "Modern vehicles incorporate dozens of sensors to provide vital sensor data to electronic control units, typically through physical wires, which increase the weight, maintenance, and cost of cars. Wireless sensor networks have been contemplated for replacing the current physical wires with wireless links, although existing networks are all single-hop, presumably because cars are small enough to be covered by lowpower communication, and multihop networking requires organizational overhead. In contradiction with previous works, we experimentally investigate the use of multihop wireless communication to support intra-car sensor networking. Extensive tests, run under various vehicular environments, indicate the potential for significant reliability, robustness, and energy usage improvements over existing single-hop approaches. Our implementation is based on the Collection Tree Protocol, a state-of-the-art multihop data collection protocol.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, there have been increasing demands for the security of wireless multimedia applications. Essentially, wireless networks, compared to traditional wired networks, are more likely to suffer from malicious attacks. Most current security methods consider physical layer and application layer security technologies independently and separately. Usually, physical layer information is dynamic in wireless networks, and application layer information is related to wireless multimedia delivery. Importantly, both of them have significant impact on security performance. In this work, we propose a joint framework involving both the physical and application layer security technologies. Specifically, by exploiting the security capacity and signal processing technologies at the physical layer and the authentication and watermarking strategies at the application layer, the available network resources can be utilized efficiently. In addition, scalable multimedia security services can be maximized within the given multimedia delivery deadlines. In particular, this joint scheme can be implemented easily with low communication overhead, which facilitates its deployment in large-scale wireless multimedia systems.",

   "abstract": "A major modernization process in air traffic management for civil aviation is currently taking place under the framework of SESAR and NextGen in Europe and the United States, respectively. Air traffic management modernization is required to meet the needs sustainable air traffic growth in Europe, the United States, and worldwide are posing. A key enabler for this modernization process is the introduction of improved communications, navigation, and surveillance technologies. In this article, new developments in aeronautical communications for air traffic management are presented, with special focus on the air/ground communications technology L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS). The most promising LDACS technology candidate, LDACS1, is described in detail, and possible extensions toward navigation and surveillance are discussed. With these extensions, LDACS1 is well placed to become the first integrated communications, navigation, and surveillance technology for civil aviation. Utilizing a common ground infrastructure, such an integrated approach simplifies deployment and reduces costs for both deployment and maintenance.",

   "abstract": "Current video conferencing applications do not scale to support a large number of participants. This article describes an IVC system that combines the best attributes of video conferencing and multi-user virtual environments. It is shown that each participant of IVC has a virtual context that is defined by his/her perspective and perception about the quality and relevance of video and audio of others. The virtual context determines both the visibility status and the required quality of videos of participants. This information can be used to dynamically alter the multicast trees that are formed among clients for the purpose of multimedia dissemination so that only the relevant videos are transmitted to end users. In addition, it is possible to reduce the video quality of a given user in response to the virtual context without the degradation having any perceptual impact. The combination of these factors reduces the required upload and download bandwidth of clients by more than 90 percent on average, making IVC highly scalable to support very large gatherings.",

   "abstract": "This article explores one of the key enablers of beyond 4G wireless networks leveraging small cell network deployments, proactive caching. Endowed with predictive capabilities and harnessing recent developments in storage, context awareness, and social networks, peak traffic demands can be substantially reduced by proactively serving predictable user demands via caching at base stations and users' devices. In order to show the effectiveness of proactive caching, we examine two case studies that exploit the spatial and social structure of the network, where proactive caching plays a crucial role. First, in order to alleviate backhaul congestion, we propose a mechanism whereby files are proactively cached during off-peak periods based on file popularity and correlations among user and file patterns. Second, leveraging social networks and D2D communications, we propose a procedure that exploits the social structure of the network by predicting the set of influential users to (proactively) cache strategic contents and disseminate them to their social ties via D2D communications. Exploiting this proactive caching paradigm, numerical results show that important gains can be obtained for each case study, with backhaul savings and a higher ratio of satisfied users of up to 22 and 26 percent, respectively. Higher gains can be further obtained by increasing the storage capability at the network edge.",

   "abstract": "Measurement of network performance in complex WiFi networks, such as in corporations and universities, is an important but challenging task, as wireless performance in networks with many access points is hard to measure and model. We demonstrate that crowdsourcing the task of measuring WiFi performance is an effective solution to this problem. By measuring performance directly with unmodified consumer mobile devices such as smartphones, it is possible to cheaply and easily detect problems that matter to users. Aggregated performance data across clients can then provide a global view of performance trends in an enterprise network. We demonstrate that periodic sampling allows the collection of representative data while keeping battery consumption low, and we leverage mobile sensor information to intelligently schedule these measurements. This system was deployed in two different large WLANs, where we discovered numerous previously undetected performance problems.",

MmWave makes use of MIMO through large antenna arrays at both the base station and the mobile station to provide sufficient received signal power. This article explains how beamforming and precoding are different in MIMO mmWave systems than in their lower-frequency counterparts, due to different hardware constraints and channel characteristics. Two potential architectures are reviewed: hybrid analog/digital precoding/combining and combining with low-resolution analog- to-digital converters. The potential gains and design challenges for these strategies are discussed, and future research directions are highlighted.",

   "abstract": "The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a framework for the construction and operation of reliable packet-switched transport networks based on the architectures for MPLS and Pseudowires. Its development has been shared between the IETF, where the MPLS expertise resides, and the ITU-T, with its historic understanding of transport networks. MPLS-TP adds two significant features to the MPLS toolkit: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), and linear protection switching. Unlike OAM, which resulted in two application specific and incompatible standards being approved at the World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA) in November 2012, the MPLS-TP linear protection specification has resulted in a single unified solution that has been published in IETF RFCs and in ITU-T Recommendation G.8131. This article outlines the novel concepts and operation principles of the unified MPLS-TP linear protection switching mechanism and discusses how it differs from pre-existing solutions. In addition, the issues of compatibility with pre-existing solutions and the applicability to other network topologies are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The need for better adaptation of networks to transported flows has led to research on new approaches such as content aware networks and network aware applications. In parallel, recent developments of multimedia and content oriented services and applications such as IPTV, video streaming, video on demand, and Internet TV reinforced interest in multicast technologies. IP multicast has not been widely deployed due to interdomain and QoS support problems; therefore, alternative solutions have been investigated. This article proposes a management driven hybrid multicast solution that is multi-domain and media oriented, and combines overlay multicast, IP multicast, and P2P. The architecture is developed in a content aware network and network aware application environment, based on light network virtualization. The multicast trees can be seen as parallel virtual content aware networks, spanning a single or multiple IP domains, customized to the type of content to be transported while fulfilling the quality of service requirements of the service provider.",

   "abstract": "Multi-user MIMO offers big advantages over conventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap single-antenna terminals, a rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation is simplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency bins. However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned, with roughly equal numbers of service antennas and terminals and frequency-division duplex operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as large-scale antenna systems, very large MIMO, hyper MIMO, full-dimension MIMO, and ARGOS) makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a large excess of service antennas over active terminals and time-division duplex operation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever smaller regions of space to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency. Other benefits of massive MIMO include extensive use of inexpensive low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the MAC layer, and robustness against intentional jamming. The anticipated throughput depends on the propagation environment providing asymptotically orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed any limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional research problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for newly joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided by the excess of service antennas, reducing internal power consumption to achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment scenarios. This article presents an overview of the massive MIMO concept and contemporary research on the topic.",

   "abstract": "The videoconferencing industry is undergoing the most substantial change in a decade. Demand for advanced collaboration functionality and the highest quality of media presentation is meeting the requirement for Internet-based \"over the top\" communication, allowing unlimited communication between the organizations and individuals. We claim that these two contradictory requirements are best conciliated through deployment of a cloud service with elements of Network and Infrastructure as a Service required to support global videoconferencing. The operational architecture we present enjoys the full benefits of the cloud networking model, including elastic scaling, on-demand resource availability, and a no-capex service model. The videoconferencing infrastructure requirements on the application level, and the quality requirements on the network level, are addressed in the single platform, opening new optimization possibilities. We describe the network-level wide-area routing and service discovery mechanisms we have deployed to improve the videoconferencing user experience through reduction of communication delay and packet loss. We further describe the service economy model, discussing the key trade-offs relevant for network cloud operations.",

   "abstract": "The need for aerial networks is growing with the recent advance of micro aerial vehicles, which enable a wide range of civilian applications. Our experimental analysis shows that wireless connectivity among MAVs is challenged by the mobility and heterogeneity of the nodes, lightweight antenna design, body blockage, constrained embedded resources, and limited battery power. However, the movement and location of MAVs are known and may be controlled to establish wireless links with the best transmission opportunities in time and space. This special ecosystem undoubtedly requires a rethinking of wireless communications and calls for novel networking approaches. Supported by empirical results, we identify important research questions, and introduce potential solutions and directions for investigation.",

Historically, mmWave bands were ruled out for cellular usage mainly due to concerns regarding short-range and non-line-of-sight coverage issues. In this article, we present recent results from channel measurement campaigns and the development of advanced algorithms and a prototype, which clearly demonstrate that the mmWave band may indeed be a worthy candidate for next generation (5G) cellular systems. The results of channel measurements carried out in both the United States and Korea are summarized along with the actual free space propagation measurements in an anechoic chamber. Then a novel hybrid beamforming scheme and its link- and system-level simulation results are presented. Finally, recent results from our mmWave prototyping efforts along with indoor and outdoor test results are described to assert the feasibility of mmWave bands for cellular usage.",

   "abstract": "The use of mmWave frequencies for wireless communications offers channel bandwidths far greater than previously available, while enabling dozens or even hundreds of antenna elements to be used at the user equipment, base stations, and access points. To date, MIMO techniques, such as spatial multiplexing, beamforming, and diversity, have been widely deployed in lower-frequency systems such as IEEE 802.11n/ac (wireless local area networks) and 3GPP LTE 4G cellphone standards. Given the tiny wavelengths associated with mmWave, coupled with differences in the propagation and antennas used, it is unclear how well spatial multiplexing with multiple streams will be suited to future mmWave mobile communications. This tutorial explores the fundamental issues involved in selecting the best communications approaches for mmWave frequencies, and provides insights, challenges, and appropriate uses of each MIMO technique based on early knowledge of the mmWave propagation environment.",

This paradigm has often been identified with the solutions developed inside the IETF MANET working group, and for this reason it is called the MANET paradigm. However, they do not coincide, and in the last decade they clearly diverged. In this article, we start from the reasons why the MANET paradigm did not have a major impact on computer communications, and we discuss the evolution of the multihop ad hoc networking paradigm by building on the lessons learned from the MANET research. Specifically, we analyze four successful networking paradigms, mesh, sensor, opportunistic, and vehicular networks, that emerged from the MANET world as a more pragmatic application of the multihop ad hoc networking paradigm. We also present the new research directions in the multihop ad hoc networking field: peoplecentric networking, triggered by the increasing penetration of the smartphones in everyday life, which is generating a people-centric revolution in computing and communications.",

   "abstract": "Space weather refers to the conditions and evolution of Earth's near space environment including electron density variations in the ionosphere. This environment is influenced by both the Sun and terrestrial processes, and has an impact on communications, navigation, and terrestrial power systems. The recent discovery of clear signatures in the ionosphere related to tsunamis and earthquakes suggests that the ionosphere itself may serve as a valuable and versatile sensor, registering many types of Earth- and space-based phenomena. To realize this potential, ionospheric electron density must be monitored through a dense wide-area sensor mesh that is expensive to realize with traditional deployments and observation techniques. Crowdsourcing can help pursue this novel direction by providing new capabilities, including an increase in the number of sensors as well as expanding data transport capabilities through participating devices that act as relays. This article describes the Mahali project, which is currently at the beginning of exploring these promising techniques. Mahali uses GPS signals that penetrate the ionosphere for science rather than positioning. A large number of ground-based sensors will be able to feed data through mobile devices into a cloud-based processing environment, enabling a tomographic analysis of the global ionosphere at unprecedented resolution and coverage. This novel approach brings the exploitation of the ionosphere as a global earth system sensor technologically and economically within reach.",

   "abstract": "Multicasting in WDM core networks is an efficient way to economize network resources for several multimedia applications. Due to their complexity and cost, multicast capable switches are rare in the proposed architectures. The paper investigates the multicast routing without splitters in directed (asymmetric) graphs. The objective is to minimize the number of used wavelengths and if there are several solutions, choose the lowest cost one. We show that the optimal solution is a set of light-trails. An efficient heuristic is proposed to minimize conflicts between the light-trails, and so to minimize the number of used wavelengths. The performance is compared to existing light-trail based heuristics. Our algorithm provides a good solution with a few wavelengths required and a low cost.",

This mobile ecosystem is constructed to provide context awareness capabilities for different roles (i.e., users or developers) in the system and facilitate interactions between them. This system can ease the development of context-aware mobile applications, and enable context-aware mobile crowdsensing considering environmental, personal, and social information. We present a flow of context-aware solutions designed on this system, and highlight the orchestrations and advantages of different context-aware schemes in the system for different types of users (requesters and participants) in mobile crowdsensing. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed mobile ecosystem by presenting a novel context-aware mobile crowdsensing application called Smart City, and evaluate the system performance based on this application.",

   "abstract": "Disasters can cause severe service disruptions due to large-scale correlated cascading failures in telecom networks. Major network disruptions due to disasters - both natural (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, 2011 Japan Tsunami) and human-made (e.g., 9/11 terrorist attack) - deprive the affected population of essential network services for weeks and severely hamper rescue operations. Many techniques exist to provide fast network protection, but they are optimized for limited faults without addressing the extent of disaster failures. Thus, there is a pressing need for novel robust survivability methods to mitigate the effects of disasters on telecom networks. While researchers in climatology, geology, and environmental science have been studying how to predict disasters and assess disaster risks for certain regions, networking research can exploit this information to develop novel methods to prepare networks to handle disasters with the knowledge of risky regions and to better prepare them for a predicted disaster. The events during the aftermath of a disaster should also be considered. For instance, methods to re-arrange network resources and services on a partially damaged network, which is the property of a self-organizing network, should be developed, and new algorithms to manage the post-disaster traffic deluge and to relieve the rescue operations after a disaster, with the knowledge of the post-disaster failures, should be investigated. Since cloud services today are an integral part of our society and massive amounts of content/services have been created and shared over the cloud, loss/disruption of critical content/ services caused by disasters can significantly affect the security and economic well being of our society. As the network is becoming increasingly an end-to-content (vs. end-to-end) connection provider, we have to ensure reachability of content from any point of a network, which we call content connectivity (in contrast to network connectivity) after disaster failures. This article presents the nature of possible disruptions in telecom networks caused by disaster events, and sheds light on how to prepare the network and cloud services against disasters, and adapt them for disaster disruptions and cascading failures.",

   "abstract": "The rapid increase in network traffic with new bandwidth-hungry applications such as cloud computing and telemedicine makes disaster survivability a crucial concern as the data (and revenue) loss caused by large-scale correlated cascading failures can be very high. To alleviate their impact, new measures should be taken since the nature of the network changes dramatically as available resources decrease during disasters. We develop a metric, called degraded-service tolerance, which can reduce protection cost and network disruption, and support maximal carried traffic in case of disasters. Degraded-service-tolerant connections can be admitted and recovered with reduced bandwidth under resource crunch. Our scheme re-assigns resources among connections by leveraging their degraded-service tolerance. A case study shows how our proposal can be applied to boost network performance during the resource crunch following a disaster.",

   "abstract": "This article explores network densification as the key mechanism for wireless evolution over the next decade. Network densification includes densification over space (e.g, dense deployment of small cells) and frequency (utilizing larger portions of radio spectrum in diverse bands). Large-scale cost-effective spatial densification is facilitated by self-organizing networks and intercell interference management. Full benefits of network densification can be realized only if it is complemented by backhaul densification, and advanced receivers capable of interference cancellation.",

As corporations migrate their infrastructure to the cloud using the infrastructure as a service model, cloud providers need to offer disaster-resilient services. This article provides guidelines to design a data center network infrastructure to support a disaster- resilient infrastructure as a service cloud.

In this article, we show by example how the emerging area of robust optimization can advance the network planning by a more accurate mathematical description of the demand uncertainty. After a general introduction of the concept and its application to a basic network design problem, we present two applications: multi-layer and mixed-line-rate network design. We conclude with a discussion of extensions of the robustness concept to increase the accuracy of handling uncertainties.",

   "abstract": "Troubleshooting of problems, such as attacks and misconfigurations, and ensuring the resilience of networks is a significant issue for network operators. It increasingly requires the management of a distributed, potentially multidomain, monitoring and detection infrastructure that can be used to direct mitigation strategies that make run-time adjustments to network mechanisms and services. This can be a complex task. In this article we describe an integrated framework for the design, evaluation, and deployment of network resilience strategies. These strategies describe the management behavior of a number of federated, policy-controlled resilience mechanisms, such as monitoring and detection systems. The framework allows the generalization of the most effective policy configurations into reusable management patterns, which can then be rapidly deployed in the network infrastructure.",

Are we really prepared for such failure scenarios? Given that failures can occur on both the network and data center sides, is it possible to have efficient end-to-end recovery? The answer is mostly negative due to the separate operation of these domains. This article offers a solution to this problem based on network virtualization, and discusses the necessary architecture and algorithm details. It also answers the question of whether it is better to provide resilience in the virtual or physical layer from a cost effectiveness and failure coverage perspective.",

   "abstract": "Mobile services based on 4G LTE services are steadily expanding across global markets, providing subscribers with the type of responsive Internet browsing experience that previously was only possible on wired broadband connections. With more than 200 commercial LTE networks in operation as of August 2013 [1], LTE subscriptions are expected to exceed 1.3 billion by the end of 2018 [2]. LTE's rapid uptake, based on exponential growth in network data traffic, has opened the industry's eyes to an important reality: the mobile industry must deliver an economically sustainable capacity and performance growth strategy; one that offers increasingly better coverage and a superior user experience at lower cost than existing wireless systems, including LTE. This strategy will be based on a combination of network topology innovations and new terminal capabilities. Simple network economics also require that the industry's strategy enable new services, new applications, and ultimately new opportunities to monetize the user experience. To address these pressing requirements, many expert prognosticators are turning their attention to future mobile broadband technologies and standards (i.e., 5G) as well as evolutions of the 3GPP's existing LTE standard and IEEE 802.11 standards.",

   "abstract": "Device-to-device communication is currently a hot research topic within 3GPP. Even though D2D communication has been part of previous ad hoc, meshed and sensor networks proposals, the main contribution by 3GPP is that the direct communication among two devices is carried out over a dynamically assigned, licensed spectrum; thus, it is under full control of the cellular network. D2D communication creates a market potential for new services, new approaches to efficient spectrum use, and security concepts. This is especially true if D2D communication is extended to larger communication groups organized in meshed clusters. In this article, we discuss the potential and shortcomings of D2D communication as proposed today, advocating for the use of network coding as an enabling technology for enhanced security and communication efficiency using the PlayNCool and CORE protocols as key examples to deliver smarter D2D systems.",

   "abstract": "Context awareness is one of the building blocks of smart applications that constitutes smart spaces. With the emergence of cyber physical systems, it is now possible to create spaces that are truly adaptable and smart. In these spaces, contextual parameters are captured by many wireless sensor nodes. This collected data is processed to understand the context in real time. Since a large number of sensors are deployed, processing all the data is a big task. Moreover, since the sensors are powered by batteries, they have a limited lifetime. Sensing only when there is a context event can save energy as well as reduce data processing. To make sensor nodes operate perpetually, ambient energy harvesters can be used. Typically, the energy harvesting source of a sensor is related to the physical parameters the sensor is measuring. We propose exploiting this property to develop a context-event triggering mechanism in this article. We also adapt the context-aware application framework for incorporating context-event triggers by harvesters. A Smart-M3-based architecture is also proposed. Through a real-world use case, we illustrate significant energy savings and reduced data processing in our proposed approach.",

   "abstract": "The IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment, or WAVE, system uses 5.9 GHz band. Recently, however, the FCC announced its intention to share the band for WLANs based on new standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. In this article, we discuss the problems in the possible coexistence scenario of WAVE and WLAN, such as direct competition between WLAN and WAVE devices for bandwidth and the hidden terminal problem. The problems are exacerbated by the different bandwidth used by the two technologies, so the only usable sensing method between them is energy detection. In this article, we consider one way to address the problems within the current standards framework, which is the combined control of interframe space and the receiver sensitivity on the WLAN devices cued by the energy detection.",

In recent years, however, new satellite technologies have been pushed to the market, reopening the debate on the possibilities of having high-performance satellite access networks. Therefore, the performance monitoring and analysis of such networks is of great interest and importance for both industry and academia. In this article we present experiments we conducted for and results we obtained from the performance monitoring and measurement of two satellite broadband Internet access services. Moreover, we describe the simulator we built for the black-box analysis of the traffic shaping mechanism employed by the satellite operator. We quantify the real performance achievable with these technologies. Our unique results show when and how new-generation Internet satellite services can be a promising way to provide broadband Internet connections to users, and shed light on the traffic shaping mechanism employed by the operator and the possibilities left for the users.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a novel approach to onthe- fly establishment of multihop wireless access networks (OEMAN) for disaster response. OEMAN extends Internet connectivity from surviving access points to disaster victims using their own mobile devices. OEMAN is set up on demand using wireless virtualization to create virtual access points on mobile devices. Virtual access points greedily form a tree-based topology, configured automatically for naming and addressing, which is then used to provide multihop wireless Internet access to users. Ordinary users can easily connect to the Internet through OEMAN as if they are connected through conventional access points. After connecting, users naturally contribute to the network extension, realizing the self-supporting capability of a disaster's local communities. The proposed scheme establishes a wireless access network quickly, which is essential in emergency relief situations. Furthermore, OEMAN is transparent to users and cost effective as it does not require additional hardware. Experimental evaluations on top of our preliminary prototype over Windows-based laptops confirm OEMAN's feasibility and its effectiveness for multihop paths of up to seven hops, and standard Internet services such as audio and video streaming.",

   "abstract": "Service creation by ordinary users without technical know-how has become increasingly popular in the Web 2.0 era. There is a growing need for ordinary Web 2.0 users to embed telecom services into their existing web applications such as blog, wiki, or online shops' homepages without conventional programming. However, the current open APIs, SDK, and graphical service creation environment technologies are mainly aimed at experienced developers with professional technical knowledge, rather than ordinary Web 2.0 users. To facilitate the latter's use of telecom network services in their web applications, this article proposes a novel web-element-based exposure approach for such services. It encapsulates lowlevel APIs in a series of customised independent web elements, which can be directly embedded in the web page by the Customization-Copy-Paste feature. The flexible invocation of telecom services by ordinary Web 2.0 users will greatly promote web-based telecommunication applications.",

   "abstract": "Advances in statistical physics relating to our understanding of large-scale complex systems have recently been successfully applied in the context of communication networks. Statistical mechanics methods can be used to decompose global system behavior into simple local interactions. Thus, large-scale problems can be solved or approximated in a distributed manner with iterative lightweight local messaging. This survey discusses how statistical physics methodology can provide efficient solutions to hard network problems that are intractable by classical methods. We highlight three typical examples in the realm of networking and communications. In each case we show how a fundamental idea of statistical physics helps solve the problem in an efficient manner. In particular, we discuss how to perform multicast scheduling with message passing methods, how to improve coding using the crystallization process, and how to compute optimal routing by representing routes as interacting polymers.",

   "abstract": "Flexgrid technology has recently been presented as the most promising option for upgrading the currently operating fixed grid optical networks and extending their capacity to be able to deal with the massive traffic volumes forecast for the next decade. Although the current traffic is successfully supported on fixed grid networks, flexgrid technology brings features that are not offered by the fixed grid networks, such as transporting optical connections with a capacity beyond 100 Gb/s and elasticity against time-varying traffic. In light of this, a gradual fixed grid to flexgrid migration is generally accepted in order to add these useful features to the network. In this article, we study the migration process where flexgrid is deployed in the network progressively, and review the main drivers and open issues induced by its deployment.",

This concept has been developed in the context of the European project GEYSERS. GEYSERS has proposed a novel multi-layer architecture, described in detail, that employs optical networking capable of provisioning optical network and IT resources for end-to-end cloud service delivery. The procedures required to perform virtual infrastructure planning and replanning at the different architecture layers are also detailed. An optimization scheme suitable to dynamically plan and replan virtual infrastructures is presented and compared to conventional approaches, and the benefits of dynamic replanning are discussed and quantified. The final project demonstration, focusing on planning, replanning, and dynamically establishing virtual infrastructures over the physical resources, is presented, while some emulation results are provided to further evaluate the performance of the GEYSERS solution.",

   "abstract": "Polar codes represent an emerging class of error-correcting codes with power to approach the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel. This overview article aims to illustrate its principle, generation and decoding techniques. Unlike the traditional capacity-approaching coding strategy that tries to make codes as random as possible, the polar codes follow a different philosophy, also originated by Shannon, by creating a jointly typical set. Channel polarization, a concept central to polar codes, is intuitively elaborated by a Matthew effect in the digital world, followed by a detailed overview of construction methods for polar encoding. The butterfly structure of polar codes introduces correlation among source bits, justifying the use of the SC algorithm for efficient decoding. The SC decoding technique is investigated from the conceptual and practical viewpoints. State-of-the-art decoding algorithms, such as the BP and some generalized SC decoding, are also explained in a broad framework. Simulation results show that the performance of polar codes concatenated with CRC codes can outperform that of turbo or LDPC codes. Some promising research directions in practical scenarios are also discussed in the end.",

   "abstract": "Wi-Fi systems have been continuously evolving to provide a 10-fold increase in data rates every five years, exploiting higher frequencies and larger bandwidths. With each evolution, there has been an improvement in power efficiency along with data rates. This power efficiency improvement is becoming harder to sustain with increasing data rates, and power efficiency is suggested in this article as the next big challenge for multi-gigabit-per-second Wi-Fi systems. The impact of increased bandwidth on the baseband, mixed-signal, and RF design of Wi-Fi systems is studied. A low-power architecture suitable for large-bandwidth Wi-Fi systems is proposed to address the power efficiency challenge. This architecture scales with bandwidth and adapts bandwidth to the data rate requirements.",

   "abstract": "Context-aware systems based on location open up new possibilities to users in terms of acquiring custom services by gathering context information, especially in systems where the high mobility of users increases their usability. In this context, this article presents a privacy-preserving solution offering context-aware services based on location in MCC. We propose a middleware, called PRECISE, which provides users with custom context-aware recommendations. These recommendations are given by considering the context information, and the users' locations, privacy policies, and previously visited places. MCC plays a key role in this solution, moving the data processing and storage needs to the cloud, as well as further advantages such as elasticity and load balancing. A thorough discussion when comparing PRECISE with other related works confirms that our solution improves the most relevant proposals so far.",

   "abstract": "Cooperative satellite cells and terrestrial wireless communication networks (comprising macrocells, picocells, and the Internet) are much anticipated access technologies to enable users to seamlessly access rich multimedia content (e.g., TV broadcasting, VoD streaming, and other services) on their devices. Furthermore, context awareness has become popular to accompany these services not only to enhance the users' perceived service quality but also to improve the overall utilization of such cooperative networks. However, delivering context-aware multimedia content through these cooperative networks is associated with a significant research challenge due to the inherently different satellites and terrestrial networks technologies. For example, to provide context-specific TV programs to a user, a satellite needs to adopt unicast-style delivery. This may be an expensive operation since satellites are intrinsically useful for broadcasting or multicasting services to a wide audience. In contrast, terrestrial communication networks can be better suited to perform unicast-based context-aware content delivery. In this article, we address these challenges, and propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation method to effectively utilize the satellite and terrestrial networks for providing context-aware contents to many users. Computer-based simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

   "abstract": "This article first reviews the proximity discovery techniques used in most device-to-device communication systems. The associated issues when applied to a cellular network and the potential solutions are then addressed. We propose a unified discovery design for full, partial, and off-network coverage scenarios. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of packet and signature-based discovery schemes. We present a signature-based discovery design as a conceptual example for cellular applications. Through this example, we demonstrate that a cellular network can benefit from the information provided by the device discovery that a traditional cellular system lacks so that resources, interference, and connection selection can be more efficiently managed under a unified cellular network centric architecture.",

   "abstract": "This article presents empirically-based large-scale propagation path loss models for fifth-generation cellular network planning in the millimeter-wave spectrum, based on real-world measurements at 28 GHz and 38 GHz in New York City and Austin, Texas, respectively. We consider industry-standard path loss models used for today's microwave bands, and modify them to fit the propagation data measured in these millimeter-wave bands for cellular planning. Network simulations with the proposed models using a commercial planning tool show that roughly three times more base stations are required to accommodate 5G networks (cell radii up to 200 m) compared to existing 3G and 4G systems (cell radii of 500 m to 1 km) when performing path loss simulations based on arbitrary pointing angles of directional antennas. However, when directional antennas are pointed in the single best directions at the base station and mobile, coverage range is substantially improved with little increase in interference, thereby reducing the required number of 5G base stations. Capacity gains for random pointing angles are shown to be 20 times greater than today's fourth-generation Long Term Evolution networks, and can be further improved when using directional antennas pointed in the strongest transmit and receive directions with the help of beam combining techniques.",

The aim of this article is to show that this standard provides a framework that could promote the introduction of applications into the market. Thus, these specifications could be further developed, reducing the gap between the industry and research communities. The implemented prototype makes use of software defined radio platforms to interface between the analog devices and the computer where the signal processing is performed. The use of this concept provides the system with enough flexibility and modularity to include new features in the prototype without requiring long development time.",

   "abstract": "Air traffic is continuously increasing worldwide, with both manned and unmanned aircraft looking to coexist in the same airspace in the future. Next generation air traffic management systems are crucial in successfully handling this growth and improving the safety of billions of future passengers. The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system is a core part of this future. Unlike traditional radar systems, this technology empowers aircraft to automatically broadcast their locations and intents, providing enhanced situational awareness. This article discusses important issues with the current state of ADS-B as it is being rolled out. We report from our OpenSky sensor network in Central Europe, which is able to capture about 30 percent of the European commercial air traffic. We analyze the 1090 MHz communication channel to understand the current state and its behavior under the increasing traffic load. Furthermore, the article considers important security challenges faced by ADS-B. Our insights are intended to help identify open research issues, furthering new interest and developments in this field.",

   "abstract": "The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami drastically changed Japanese society, and the requirements for ICT was completely redefined. After the disaster, it was impossible for disaster victims to utilize their communication devices, such as cellular phones, tablet computers, or laptop computers, to notify their families and friends of their safety and confirm the safety of their loved ones since the communication infrastructures were physically damaged or lacked the energy necessary to operate. Due to this drastic event, we have come to realize the importance of device-to-device communications. With the recent increase in popularity of D2D communications, many research works are focusing their attention on a centralized network operated by network operators and neglect the importance of decentralized infrastructureless multihop communication, which is essential for disaster relief applications. In this article, we propose the concept of multihop D2D communication network systems that are applicable to many different wireless technologies, and clarify requirements along with introducing open issues in such systems. The first generation prototype of relay by smartphone can deliver messages using only users' mobile devices, allowing us to send out emergency messages from disconnected areas as well as information sharing among people gathered in evacuation centers. The success of field experiments demonstrates steady advancement toward realizing user-driven networking powered by communication devices independent of operator networks.",

This article briefly introduces some Japanese research and development activities for disaster-related technologies, including those carried out by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). First, we discuss lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011. We show that the preferred communication tool in a disaster situation depends on the time that has elapsed after the disaster. We then summarize several research projects for developing robust and dependable communication networks, including an information distribution platform, and outline the research projects of NICT's Resilient ICT Research Center as well.",

In this article, we first review and classify the state-of-the-art research based on different considered network scenarios. We then introduce our preliminary studies on delay-aware resource control with bursty traffic, in which we propose an optimization framework and formulate a general queuing model for performance evaluation and optimization.

Guaranteeing required levels of QoS to cognitive users and ensuring necessary protection to incumbent users are the two main challenges in opportunistic spectrum access. This article identifies the main requirements and challenges for QoS support in cognitive radio networks. A framework for a twofold cognitive manager is presented; one part managing spectrum availability on longer timescales and the other handling resource management on shorter timescales. This article gives particular focus to the functionalities of the latter cognitive manager related to resource management.

   "abstract": "This article re-examines the fundamental notion of interference in wireless networks by contrasting traditional approaches to new concepts that handle interference in a creative way. Specifically, we discuss the fundamental limits of the interference channel and present the interference alignment technique and its extension of signal alignment techniques. Contrary to this traditional view, which treats interference as a detrimental phenomenon, we introduce three concepts that handle interference as a useful resource. The first concept exploits interference at the modulation level and leads to simple multiuser downlink precoding that provides significant energy savings. The second concept uses radio frequency radiation for energy harvesting and handles interference as a source of green energy. The last concept refers to a secrecy environment and uses interference as an efficient means to jam potential eavesdroppers. These three techniques bring a new vision about interference in wireless networks and motivate a plethora of potential new applications and services.",

   "abstract": "In a series of papers by Pawlikowski and his team, they warned about a deep crisis of credibility in simulation studies for the performance evaluation of telecommunication networks. The goal of this article is to revisit the investigation on simulation credibility and to extend the previous research in this area by presenting the results of a comprehensive survey of over 8370 IEEE publications (2007-2009) on telecommunication networks which appeared in the proceedings of IEEE Transactions on Communications (TC), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TN), IEEE Infocom, IEEE ICC, and IEEE Globecom. These proceedings were selected based on their popularity and relevance to our study. Besides simulation credibility, we also report on the commonly used simulation tools and performance analysis methodology adopted by the authors of the surveyed papers. Our findings show that a significant number of authors did not provide information of the simulation tools used or, even when they did, there was not enough information about the CI or SE of simulation results presented in the surveyed papers. Thus, there is no significant change with respect to quality and credibility of the simulation studies revised and the deep crisis of credibility still remains. The research design most authors prefer is a hybrid one where both simulation and analytic methods are being used for network performance analysis. Finally, we provide guidelines for the best practice of using simulation tools for the performance evaluation of telecommunication networks.",

   "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks, mWSNs, have attracted a lot of attention recently. This is because sink mobility can greatly alleviate the hotspot issue in WSNs and further prolong the network lifetime. However, sink mobility also causes unexpected changes in network topology and data routing paths, which can largely affect the routing performance in such networks. Design of efficient routing protocols for mWSNs has been a critical issue, and much work has been carried out in this aspect. In this article, we first classify existing protocols based on different design criteria and then present a survey of the state-of-the-art routing protocols in this area. We illustrate how each of the protocols works, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we point out some future directions for efficient routing in mWSNs.",

   "abstract": "METIS is the EU flagship 5G project with the objective of laying the foundation for 5G systems and building consensus prior to standardization. The METIS overall approach toward 5G builds on the evolution of existing technologies complemented by new radio concepts that are designed to meet the new and challenging requirements of use cases today's radio access networks cannot support. The integration of these new radio concepts, such as massive MIMO, ultra dense networks, moving networks, and device-to-device, ultra reliable, and massive machine communications, will allow 5G to support the expected increase in mobile data volume while broadening the range of application domains that mobile communications can support beyond 2020. In this article, we describe the scenarios identified for the purpose of driving the 5G research direction. Furthermore, we give initial directions for the technology components (e.g., link level components, multinode/multiantenna, multi-RAT, and multi-layer networks and spectrum handling) that will allow the fulfillment of the requirements of the identified 5G scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Timely communication in wireless multihop sensor networks requires high throughput and low delay, which can be achieved by exploiting multiple channels and time slots. Efficient scheduling becomes indispensable if multiple channels and time slots are utilized. Optimum scheduling of multiple channels and time slots in multihop networks is an NP-complete problem. We apply metaheuristic approaches to solve the scheduling problem because of the fact that not only the global solution but near-optimal solutions can satisfy a given end-to-end delay bound. We adopt simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to schedule the resources. Different measures and stopping conditions are explored to validate the feasibility of scheduling via SA and PSO, and to compare the performance of the two metaheuristics in satisfying the desired end-to-end delay. Although the purpose of this article is to compare SA and PSO, the simulation results demonstrate that PSO-based scheduling outperforms SA-based scheduling in terms of end-to-end delay.",

   "abstract": "The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami drastically changed Japanese society, and the requirements for ICT was completely redefined. After the disaster, it was impossible for disaster victims to utilize their communication devices, such as cellular phones, tablet computers, or laptop computers, to notify their families and friends of their safety and confirm the safety of their loved ones since the communication infrastructures were physically damaged or lacked the energy necessary to operate. Due to this drastic event, we have come to realize the importance of device-to-device communications. With the recent increase in popularity of D2D communications, many research works are focusing their attention on a centralized network operated by network operators and neglect the importance of decentralized infrastructureless multihop communication, which is essential for disaster relief applications. In this article, we propose the concept of multihop D2D communication network systems that are applicable to many different wireless technologies, and clarify requirements along with introducing open issues in such systems. The first generation prototype of relay by smartphone can deliver messages using only users' mobile devices, allowing us to send out emergency messages from disconnected areas as well as information sharing among people gathered in evacuation centers. The success of field experiments demonstrates steady advancement toward realizing user-driven networking powered by communication devices independent of operator networks.",

In this article, we lay out its basic principles, study the key factors that have given rise to its adoption, and focus on the new set of challenges it brings about in various aspects of wireless networking. We study user-centric solutions on a case-by-case basis, along the dimensions of wireless access, provision of communication services, and wireless network management. We tackle specific security and performance challenges by designing and implementing architectures for secure VoIP communication tailored to user-centric wireless networks, and for robust user-driven wireless topology monitoring, a critical network management task. In both cases, we quantify the tradeoff between security and performance, showcasing the potential of relying on users to carry out traditionally provider-centric tasks.",

   "abstract": "Mobile devices such as smartphones are widely deployed in the world, and many people use them to download/upload media such as video and pictures to remote servers. On the other hand, a mobile device has limited resources, and some media processing tasks must be migrated to the media cloud for further processing. However, a significant question is, can mobile users trust the media services provided by the media cloud service providers? Many traditional security approaches are proposed to secure the data exchange between mobile users and the media cloud. However, first, because multimedia such as video is large-sized data, and mobile devices have limited capability to process media data, it is important to design a lightweight security method; second, uploading and downloading multi-resolution images/videos make it difficult for the traditional security methods to ensure security for users of the media cloud. Third, the error-prone wireless environment can cause failure of security protection such as authentication. To address the above challenges, in this article, we propose to use both secure sharing and watermarking schemes to protect user's data in the media cloud. The secure sharing scheme allows users to upload multiple data pieces to different clouds, making it impossible to derive the whole information from any one cloud. In addition, the proposed scalable watermarking algorithm can be used for authentications between personal mobile users and the media cloud. Furthermore, we introduce a new solution to resist multimedia transmission errors through a joint design of watermarking and Reed- Solomon codes. Our studies show that the proposed approach not only achieves good security performance, but also can enhance media quality and reduce transmission overhead.",

Mobile phone security has become an important aspect of security issues in wireless multimedia communications. As the most popular mobile operating system, Android security has been extensively studied by researchers. However, few works have studied mobile phone multimedia security.

   "abstract": "Technologies that will lead to adaptive, intelligent, and aware wireless communications systems are expected to offer solutions to the capacity, interference, and reliability problems of wireless networks. The spectrum sensing feature of CR systems is a step forward to better recognize the problems and to achieve efficient spectrum allocation. On the other hand, even though spectrum sensing can constitute a solid base to accomplish the reconfigurability and awareness goals of next generation networks, a new perspective is required to benefit from all of the dimensions of the available electro (or spectrum) hyperspace, beyond frequency and time. Therefore, spectrum sensing should evolve to a more general and comprehensive awareness-providing mechanism, not only as part of CR systems but also as a communication environment-awareness component of an ASHA paradigm that can adapt sensing parameters autonomously to ensure robust signal identification, parameter estimation, and interference avoidance. Such an approach will lead to recognition of communication opportunities in different dimensions of the spectrum hyperspace, and provide necessary information about the air interfaces, access techniques, and waveforms that are deployed over the monitored spectrum to accomplish ASHA resource and interference management.",

   "abstract": "Energy harvesting for wireless communication networks is a new paradigm that allows terminals to recharge their batteries from external energy sources in the surrounding environment. A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This article provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space. The article also discusses the benefits of a potential integration of SWIPT technologies in modern communication networks in the context of resource allocation and cooperative cognitive radio networks.",

   "abstract": "This article explores smart grid technologies that can be applied to a telecommunication network to achieve energy-efficient networking, autonomous operation, and adaptation to realtime electricity pricing schemes. With the fast penetration of renewable energy sources within base stations and data centers, the telecommunication operator can establish an active role in the energy market by adjusting power consumption in real time. In the telecommunications sector, energy management technologies have recently emerged with BS management schemes and virtual machine migration/allocation strategies. In the energy sector, smart grid technologies and new standards enable real-time management and pricing. The only brick missing is the orchestration of the technologies in the two sectors to enable smart telecommunications network operation in terms of energy consumption. In this article, concepts such as demand response, supply load control, and the model of the \"prosumer\" in the smart grid are correlated to the operation of modern radio and data center networks. The main outcome of the research is to provide new ideas for net zero service delivery and explore the role of the telecommunication provider in the energy market where dynamic electricity pricing is expected to hold a critical role in decision making processes.",

Simultaneously, the worldwide urbanization process represents a formidable challenge and attracts attention toward cities that are expected to gather higher populations and provide citizens with services in an efficient and human manner. These two trends have led to the appearance of mobile health and smart cities. In this article we introduce the new concept of smart health, which is the context-aware complement of mobile health within smart cities. We provide an overview of the main fields of knowledge that are involved in the process of building this new concept. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities that s-Health would imply and provide a common ground for further research.",

   "abstract": "This article considers the concept of device-to- device communications for the resolution of persistent issues in mobile networks. Specifically, two scenarios are described, the opportunistic coverage expansion of the infrastructure, where an access point transits to offline mode (and hence its terminals shall exploit the presence of neighboring devices in order to reroute their traffic to alternative APs), as well as the opportunistic capacity expansion scenario where an AP faces congestion issues due to the excessive traffic of its terminals or the use of an obsolete RAT with low capacity. In the same manner, part of the traffic shall be offloaded to alternative APs through the creation of D2D links with neighboring devices. In order to realize the proposed solutions, the network elements exchange information regarding their capabilities and their status so as to identify the best path from all the potential ones. Therefore, control channels for cognitive radio systems will be utilized since the information that is conveyed through them comprises information from all the layers of the protocol stack. Furthermore, the article focuses on the coverage expansion scenario, which is implemented at the w.iLab-t testbed. In order to realize the D2D constructs, the devices of the testbed will be configured to communicate through WiFi technology, and specifically the 802.11s standard for wireless mesh networks, in order to enable multihop communications. In this respect, the D2D constructs that will be created are mesh networks that comprise the problematic terminals, their neighboring terminals that offload their traffic, and the APs that receive the traffic. In order to evaluate the proposed solution, the signaling loads of the conveyed messages are measured, as well as the performance of the mesh network that is created after the solution enforcement through the use of a ping, a file transfer, and a video streaming application.",

   "abstract": "With emerging demands for local area services, device-to-device communication is conceived as a vital component for the next-generation cellular networks to improve spectral reuse, bring hop gains, and enhance system capacity. Ripening these benefits depends on efficiently solving several main technical problems, including mode selection, resource allocation, and interference management. Aiming to establish a new paradigm for solving these challenging problems in D2D communication, in this article we propose a social-aware enhanced D2D communication architecture that exploits social networking characteristics for system design. By developing a profound understanding of the interplay between social networks' properties and mobile communication problems, we qualitatively analyze how D2D communications can benefit from social features, and quantitatively assess the achievable gains in a social-aware D2D communication system.",

   "abstract": "Traditional radio receivers were narrowband and dedicated to a single frequency band exploiting LC tanks, whereas software defined radios target a flexibly programmable frequency. The broadband noise cancelling circuit technique has proven useful to achieve this target, as it breaks the traditional trade-off between low noise and broadband impedance matching. Different variants exist, with noise cancellation in the voltage or current domain, either at RF or after frequency translation to baseband. This article reviews the development of the noise cancelling technique and its role in inductorless interference robust software defined radio receivers.",

   "abstract": "Software-defined radio is a rapidly developing field that is driving the development of and innovation in communications technology, and promises to significantly impact all communications sectors. Entities developing these SDR systems require a trained workforce that has been prepared with the mindset, knowledge, skills, and tools required to address both the system (breadth) and technical (depth) aspects of SDR systems. Developing SDRs necessarily involves a collection of disciplines including, but not limited to, electromagnetics, radio-frequency engineering, communications, digital signal processing, embedded systems, computer programming, and systems engineering. Whereas electrical engineering and computer science and engineering curricula at the university level may include courses in all of these areas, a student,s typical curriculum does not; nor does it usually involve the integration of all these topics. However, SDR can be employed as an integrative construct that facilitates systems thinking and cross-domain learning via peers. In this article, we present several significant educational efforts across six U.S. universities that have developed integrated curricula in SDR, most including a significant laboratory component.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we discuss user-centric networks as a way of, if not completely solving, considerably mitigating the problem of sharing limited network capacity and resources efficiently and fairly. UCNs are self-organizing networks where the end user plays an active role in delivering networking functions such as providing Internet access to other users. We propose to leverage the recently proposed SDN paradigm to enable cooperation between wireless nodes and provide capacity sharing services in UCNs. Our SDNbased approach allows coverage of existing network infrastructure (e.g., WiFi or 3GPP) to be extended to other end users or ad hoc networks that would otherwise not be able to have access to network connectivity and services. Moreover, the proposed SDN-based architecture also takes into account current network load and conditions, and QoS requirements. Another important feature of our framework is that security is an integral part of the architecture and protocols. We discuss the requirements for enabling capacity sharing services in the context of UCNs (e.g., resource discovery, node admission control, cooperation incentives, QoS, security) and how SDN can aid in enabling such services. The article also describes the proposed SDN-enabled capacity sharing framework for UCNs.",

   "abstract": "Since the discovery of turbo codes 20 years ago and the subsequent rediscovery of low-density parity check codes a few years later, the field of channel coding has experienced a number of major advances. Until that time, code designers were usually happy with performance that came within a few decibels of the Shannon Limit, primarily due to implementation complexity constraints, whereas the new coding techniques now allow performance within a small fraction of a decibel of capacity with modest encoding and decoding complexity. Due to these significant improvements, coding standards in applications as varied as wireless mobile transmission, satellite TV, and deep space communication are being updated to incorporate the new techniques. In this article, we review a particularly exciting new class of low-density parity check codes called spatially coupled codes, which promise excellent performance over a broad range of channel conditions and decoded error rate requirements.",

   "abstract": "The article describes the potential gain by spectrum sharing between cellular operators in terms of network efficiency. The focus of the study is on a specific resource sharing scenario: spectrum sharing between two operators in cellular downlink transmission. If frequency bands are allocated dynamically and exclusively to one operator - a case called orthogonal spectrum sharing - significant gains in terms of achievable throughput (spectrum sharing gains between 50 percent and 100 percent) and user satisfaction are reported for asymmetric scenarios at link and system level as well as from two hardware demonstrators. Additionally, if frequency bands are allocated simultaneously to two operators - a case called non-orthogonal spectrum sharing - further gains are reported. In order to achieve these, different enablers from hardware technologies and base station capabilities are required. However, we argue that all requirements are fulfilled in 3GPP and newer mobile standards. Therefore, the results and conclusions of this overview article encourage to seriously consider the inter-operator spectrum sharing technologies.",

   "abstract": "IEEE 802.22 is the first world-wide standard for wireless regional area networks using cognitive radio technologies. Major drawbacks of these networks are limited network capacity and low energy efficiency. One potential solution for these drawbacks is device-to-device communication, which can be incorporated as D2DWRAN. D2DWRAN features direct intracell communication, reuse of channels, and use of multiple operating channels. In this article, we mainly discuss energy-efficient spectrum sharing in D2DWRAN. We explicate a mechanism to increase energy efficiency for long distance links using relays. Along with energy, channel utilization and fairness are also considered while choosing relays. Thus, significant improvement in both network capacity and energy efficiency can be achieved. The schemes discussed here can also be used in other D2D communication settings.",

   "abstract": "The concept of SDN has emerged as a way to address numerous challenges with traditional network architectures by decoupling network control and forwarding. So far, the use cases for SDN mainly targeted data-center applications. This article considers SDN for network carriers, facing operation of large-scale networks with millions of customers, multiple technologies, and high availability demands. With specific carrier-grade features such as scalability, reliability, flexibility, modularity, and virtualization in mind, the SPARC EU project has developed the SPARC SplitArchitecture concept. The SplitArchitecture control plane allows hierarchical layering of several control plane layers which can be flexibly mapped to data plane layers. Between control layers open interfaces are used. Furthermore, SplitArchitecture proposes an additional split of forwarding and processing functions in data path elements, enabling switch based OAM functionality and handling of tunneling techniques. The SplitArchitecture concept is evaluated in a prototype demonstrating an SDN version of BRAS: the floating BRAS. The floating BRAS allows creation of residential Internet access services with dynamically managed BRAS instances. The demo is based on a controller enabling protected MPLS transport connections spanning SDN-controlled aggregation and IP/MPLS-based core domains. The prototype showcases how SplitArchitecture enables virtualization of service nodes in an SDN-controlled network, leading to increased flexibility in configuration and placement of service creation functions. Overall, the results show that it is technically and economically beneficial to apply SDN, and specifically the SplitArchitecture concept, to the carrier domain.",

Key design considerations are investigated to deduce a novel and practical phased array antenna solution operating at 28 GHz with near spherical coverage. The approach is further evolved into a first-of- a-kind cellular phone prototype equipped with mmWave 5G antenna arrays consisting of a total of 32 low-profile antenna elements. Indoor measurements are carried out using the presented prototype to characterize the proposed mmWave antenna system using 16-QAM modulated signals with 27.925 GHz carrier frequency. The biological implications due to the absorbed electromagnetic waves when using mmWave cellular devices are studied and compared in detail with those of 3/4G cellular devices.",

   "abstract": "The increase of counterfeit mobile phones in wireless networks on emerging markets is one of the reasons for the degradation in spectral efficiency. In some countries the sales of counterfeit/ substandard phones could represent as much as 15-20 percent of the market [1]. The motivation of this article is to have a better understanding of the impact of counterfeit phones on network performance and present a solution to identify these mobile devices. Several laboratory tests and implementations emulating a real cellular coverage were performed. Results showed that counterfeit phones have degraded quality service for the user and also impact other subscribers (14 dB sensitivity difference from the original). Additionally, higher dropped calls and access failures rates (up to three times more) were observed. A new method that can identify, notify the user of, and block counterfeit devices was implemented and tested in the laboratory. This article presents several aspects that impact network reliability, as well as an innovative method to manage the access of substandard devices to cellular networks that can bring more efficient usage of spectrum resources.",

   "abstract": "The proliferation of smart phones with sensing capabilities motivates exploring the applicability limits of (phone-based) mobile sensing. While a phone can directly measure variables such as location, acceleration, and orientation, other interesting quantities one may want to measure have higher-level semantics that a phone does not directly recognize. For example, one might want to map parking lots that are free after hours, or restaurants that are popular after midnight. How can we measure such higher-level logical quantities using sensors on phones? Techniques that address this question fall in the broad area of surrogate sensing, defined as inferring high-level logical quantities by measuring weaker surrogates. The surrogates in question are variables that can be sensed using a phone, but are only weakly related to the original high-level logical quantities one is really after. The key challenge is to exploit appropriate aggregation techniques that leverage the availability of large numbers of phones to overcome the poor quality of individual surrogates. Recently, significant advances have been made in understanding the quality limits of surrogate sensing. This article overviews the main ideas and insights underlying these advances.",

   "abstract": "Important lessons for responding to a largescale disaster can be gleaned from the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami. The failure of the electrical power system and the resultant loss of information communication and processing capability severely constrained the recovery work of many municipalities. It was difficult for supporting organizations to collect and share information. A frugal information system designed around the four u-constructs is suggested as a solution for handling the very early stages of disaster relief, typically within the first 72 hours and even upon the realization of an impending disaster. This article focuses on basing communications on the most frequently available device, the cellular phone, as the foundation for a frugal IS for disaster relief. Familiar and available tools place minimal stress on an already strained communication system, and enable effective connection between those impacted by a disaster and those involved in disaster relief.",

   "abstract": "Communications capabilities are becoming an integral part of common infrastructure, and are embedded in an increasing number of consumer products to enable the Internet of Things and networked applications. The proliferation of (wireless) communications has, not surprisingly, generated new demands for higher education. First, if we consider communications engineering students, we observe that they need to be readily equipped with sophisticated skills beyond the theoretical domain in order to successfully fulfill implementation tasks and tackle practical design problems. This requirement is particularly emphasized by their future industrial employers. Second, as the integration of communications capabilities becomes widespread, there is a need to also provide core competencies to non-communications engineering students and industry professionals. These students come from a variety of fields such as mechanical engineering and computer science. They want, and indeed need, the practical tools and knowledge to develop and test communications systems, but often lack the traditional electrical engineering and signal processing background. The curriculum and the way we teach these professionals have to adapt to new challenges. In this article we outline how close integration of software defined radios into the university curriculum can help the community meet some of these challenges. In particular, we describe our early efforts to re-engineer a part of our curriculum, and present our novel approach to merge laboratories and lectures to provide a more \"hands-on\" experience to a heterogeneous student body.",

Next, an event journal standard is proposed for the collection of data needed to manage the safe and secure operation of telebiometric devices.

The upcoming 5G era, with a new 5G radio technology and increased utilization of heterogeneous networking, will further accelerate mobile data usage. One of the pillars of mobile network architecture is IP mobility management, which is currently based on centralized data path management. In this article, we first describe the efficiency issues of the centralized approach. We then discuss multiple dimensions of distributing the mobility functions, and suggest how the mobile terminal can utilize them in orchestration for efficient communication over a 5G flat mobile network.",

   "abstract": "The concept of flow-aware networking (FAN) has been introduced, discussed, and analyzed only with the use of mathematical models or computer simulations. This article presents the results of FAN\u201as first practical implementation. For the environment, the Click Modular Router was chosen. In the article, vital implementation-related issues are shown and analyzed. The results of post-implementation tests are also presented. They confirm the advantages of the XP router over the IP router. We prove that traffic in FAN is served fairly, and the packets of streaming flows are transmitted with high priority. Moreover, the test results confirm that streaming flows are served with acceptable quality even in highly loaded links, which is not observed in the classic IP network. The tests also show several problems not caught by the simulative studies available in the literature. First of all, to increase efficiency, a flow list had to be implemented in a different way than originally proposed. Also, a queuing algorithm had to be altered to eliminate too frequent changes of flow states, which resulted in a lack of stability. The presented tests ultimately prove that FAN works as a concept and that, by reaching maturity, it is ready for largescale deployment.",

   "abstract": "The Internet was originally designed as a best effort packet forwarding substrate. However, since its inception, its purpose has shifted toward a rich service-centric delivery platform. Its underlying infrastructure as well as the number of connected devices have taken on immense proportions, and sharing of capabilities has come into widespread use. Moreover, the Internet's services are becoming increasingly interactive, context-aware, and content-oriented. This has led to stringent delivery requirements being imposed on the underlying infrastructure. Despite these evolutions, management of the Internet has not evolved significantly. It remains largely static and is unable to provide dynamic end-to-end service delivery guarantees in a costeffective manner. In this article, we propose the Fluid Internet, a novel paradigm aimed at tackling these management challenges. The Fluid Internet seamlessly provisions virtualized infrastructure capabilities, adapting the delivery substrate to the dynamic requirements of services and users, much like a fluid adapting to fit its surroundings. As such, the Fluid Internet gives a service provider the ability to manage its services end to end and elastically. Our vision is achieved through a unification of concepts from network virtualization, cloud computing, and service-centric networking. The relevant stakeholders, as well as their functions and interactions, are described. Additionally, we identify the major technical challenges that remain to be tackled for the Fluid Internet vision to become a reality.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radio technology allows the reuse of the underutilized frequency spectrum on an opportunistic and non-interfering basis by means of introducing, besides the legitimate primary users of the spectrum, a new kind of users called cognitive or secondary users. Thus, reliable spectrum sensing is critical to dynamically detect available licensed frequency bands and mitigate the primary signals, but it remains realistically difficult to carry out. In fact, although distributed collaborative sensing has turned out to be fruitful for the cognitive radio environment, its accuracy is often affected by the selfish and autonomous behavior of users. In this article, we model distributed spectrum sensing and channel allocation as a non-cooperative game, and apply the minority game to bring forth and study the cooperative behavior of users. The novelty brought by our study consists of alleviating the number of users contending for primary channels by giving them the opportunity to choose between the two, either sensing the channel or being inactive during the time slot. To address the trade-off faced by the SUs, we evaluate the performance of two secondary systems in a green communications context: energy consumption and transmission delay.",

   "abstract": "As mobile Internet applications supporting real-time communications services are pervasively used, traffic patterns in mobile networks have changed significantly. New mobile Internet applications differ from traditional applications such as web browser and FTP in that they need always-on connectivity and generate a large amount of signaling traffic. The traffic patterns of these new mobile applications lead to frequent change of radio resource control states between connected and idle in the user equipment, consuming device battery power and causing excessive signaling overhead. The growth in signaling has resulted in a traffic surge that has attracted the attention of mobile network operators. In this article, we first explore traffic composition in a 3G network and show that chatty applications such as instant messenger and social network services contribute to the frequent change of radio states. We then describe the mechanism behind the surge in signaling traffic and describe the disastrous outcome when an application server failure and recovery occurs. Lastly, we discuss some remedies to reduce the application signaling traffic and network load in 3G and LTE networks. These remedies include development of network-aware smart applications that consider the mobile network characteristics and introduction of push notification services. We also present related future work and our research directions.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, the widespread availability of smartphones provided with sensors has enabled the possibility of harvesting large quantities of data in urban areas exploiting user devices, thus enabling so-called mobile crowd sensing (MCS). While many efforts have been made to improve specific techniques for MCS - spanning from signal processing to the assignment of data collection campaigns to users, and to the entire data processing spectrum - to the best of our knowledge, thus far there have been no active experiments of MCS that involve all these techniques in a large-scale real-world experiment. Based on these considerations, we started the ParticipAct Living Lab testbed, an ongoing experiment at the University of Bologna involving 300 students for one year in crowd sensing campaigns that can passively access smartphone sensors and also require active user collaboration. In this article we describe the guidelines behind the design of ParticipAct, as well as its features and architecture. Moreover, we report some of the seminal results gathered during the first three months of its deployment, including accuracy of the classifier provided by ParticipAct client and user inclination to successfully complete tasks depending on the level of active collaboration required to executing them.",

   "abstract": "Although the research on traffic prediction is an established field, most existing works have been carried out on traditional wired broadband networks and rarely shed light on cellular radio access networks (CRANs). However, with the explosively growing demand for radio access, there is an urgent need to design a traffic-aware energy-efficient network architecture. In order to realize such a design, it becomes increasingly important to model the traffic predictability theoretically and discuss the traffic-aware networking practice technically. In light of that perspective, we first exploit entropy theory to analyze the traffic predictability in CRANs and demonstrate the practical prediction performance with the state-of-the-art methods. We then propose a blueprint for a traffic-based software-defined cellular radio access network (SDCRAN) architecture and address the potential applications of predicted traffic knowledge into this envisioned architecture.",

First, essential requirements for 5G are pointed out, including higher traffic volume, indoor or hotspot traffic, and spectrum, energy, and cost efficiency. Along with these changes of requirements, we present a potential step change for the evolution toward 5G, which shows that macro-local coexisting and coordinating paths will replace one macro-dominated path as in 4G and before. We hereafter discuss emerging technologies for 5G within international mobile telecommunications. Challenges and directions in hardware, including integrated circuits and passive components, are also discussed. Finally, a whole picture for the evolution to 5G is predicted and presented.",

   "abstract": "5G will have to support a multitude of new applications with a wide variety of requirements, including higher peak and user data rates, reduced latency, enhanced indoor coverage, increased number of devices, and so on. The expected traffic growth in 10 or more years from now can be satisfied by the combined use of more spectrum, higher spectral efficiency, and densification of cells. The focus of the present article is on advanced techniques for higher spectral efficiency and improved coverage for cell edge users. We propose a smart combination of small cells, joint transmission coordinated multipoint (JT CoMP), and massive MIMO to enhance the spectral efficiency with affordable complexity. We review recent achievements in the transition from theoretical to practical concepts and note future research directions. We show in measurements with macro-plus-smallcell scenarios that spectral efficiency can be improved by flexible clustering and efficient user selection, and that adaptive feedback compression is beneficial to reduce the overhead significantly. Moreover, we show in measurements that fast feedback reporting combined with advanced channel prediction are able to mitigate the impairment effects of JT CoMP.",

   "abstract": "The explosive increase of mobile traffic demands higher spectrum efficiency for future wireless communications. By properly configuring a 2-dimensional (2D) antenna array at the basestation, the system capacity can be improved with 3 dimensional (3D) multiuser Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) techniques without modifying the terminal antennas. Therefore, the signal will propagate in a 3D space with angle dispersion in both horizontal and vertical planes. Due to its role in facilitating research and development of 3D MIMO technology, the 3D fading channel model is receiving increasing attention. However, existing fading channel models mostly focus on the azimuth angle characteristics, while neglecting the elevation angle impact. This article provides a state of the art review on 3D fading channel models, emphasizing research related to the elevation angle. We also report some recent field measurements for 3D MIMO and investigate the comprehensive propagation characteristics of the elevation angle.",

First, we argue the need to functionally integrate D2D and infrastructure-to-device (I2D) modes. Next, we address practical issues such as integrated resource scheduling of D2D communication within heterogeneous networks, proposing an extension of the proportional fairness algorithm that we call multi-modal proportional fairness (MMPF). We evaluate the impact of D2D in a two-tier scenario combining macroand micro-coverage, finding that although I2D retains a clear edge for general-purpose downloading, D2D is an appealing solution for localized transfers as well as for viral content.",

This article presents our perspective of the 5G technologies with two major themes: green and soft. By rethinking the Shannon theorem and traditional cell-centric design, network capacity can be significantly increased while network power consumption is decreased. The feasibility of the combination of green and soft is investigated through five interconnected areas of research: energy efficiency and spectral efficiency co-design, no more cells, rethinking signaling/control, invisible base stations, and full duplex radio.",

   "abstract": "Individual users and enterprises are increasingly relying on the access to internet services and cannot accept long interruption time as easily as before. Moreover, the main characteristics of next generation optical access (NGOA) networks, such as long reach and a large number of users per feeder line, turn the network reliability to an important design parameter to offer uninterrupted service delivery. In this regard, protection mechanisms become one of the crucial aspects that need to be considered in the design process of access networks. On the other hand, it should be noted that not all users can afford to pay a high extra cost for protection; hence, it is important to provide resilience in a costefficient way. A PON combining WDM and TDM technologies, referred to as hybrid WDM/TDM PON or HPON, is one of the most promising candidates for NGOA networks due to its ability to serve a large number of subscribers and offer high capacity per user. For these reasons, in this article, we propose HPON architecture offering different degrees of resilience depending on the user profiles (i.e., partial and full protection for residential and business access, respectively). Also, the investment cost of providing resilience for the proposed schemes is investigated considering various protection upgrade road maps. Our results confirm that protecting the shared part of network with a large number of users is required in order to keep the failure impact at an acceptable level, with less than 5 percent increase of investment cost compared to the unprotected case. Meanwhile, the proposed end-to-end protection for business users considerably reduces the risk of service interruption for this type of demanding user without a need to duplicate the deployment cost of an unprotected connection. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact of changes in business user percentage and protection upgrade time on the deployment cost. The results may be used as advice on cost-efficient deployment of reliable fiber access networks.",

   "abstract": "This article overviews the motivations and challenges for non-invasive wireless measurements of internal human body temperature. Microwave radiometry is an attractive method for internal thermometry, with the possibility of a wearable device that can continuously monitor temperature inside body tissues in different parts of the body, store the data, and transmit it to a digital medical record. Currently, there are a limited number of available device solutions, and they are usually not wearable or wireless. Here we discuss a possible path to implementing such a thermometer, with some initial results demonstrating about 0.2 K measurement sensitivity, and a difference between the maximal and minimal error w.r.t. a thermocouple measurement of 0.5 K. Several probes for multi-band radiometers are also presented at frequencies of 410 MHz, and 1.4, 2.7, and 4.9 GHz. The main challenges of RF interference, sensitivity, calibration, spatial resolution, miniaturization, and probe design are discussed.",

   "abstract": "In network planning one designs the network and its routing policies based on a \"guesstimate\" of the amount of traffic that might be routed through the network in the future. Clearly, not being able to foretell the future means that one of the biggest challenges in network planning is how to deal with traffic uncertainty. If not solved appropriately, the network operator has to resort to overprovisioning, which is costly. On a smaller timescale, traffic that is being routed through the network is generally stochastic in nature, which is also reflected in dynamically varying network parameters like available bandwidth and delay of links. In this article, we provide an overview of several traffic uncertainty models useful for network planning. Our focus is on offline approaches to network planning and online routing in stochastic networks. We conclude with some possible directions for future work.",

   "abstract": "Mobile consumer devices are increasingly used as personal sensing instruments, where users record their daily habits, track their physical activity, or monitor their health. Research is underway to extend today's diversity of vendor-designed \"walled garden\" repositories, ultimately repositioning individuals as producers, consumers, and remixers of a vast openly shared public data set. By empowering people to easily measure, report, and compare their own personal environments, such tools transform everyday citizens into reporting agents who uncover and visualize unseen elements of their own everyday experiences. With this important new shift in mobile device usage - from a communication tool to a ubiquitous \"experience sharing instrument\" - comes a new dimension in trust and privacy challenges. Today's privacy and trust tools that address web surfing and simple location-based services already struggle to be adopted in practice. We argue that in order to prepare for tomorrow's sensor sharing, privacy and trust must be addressed holistically, incorporating both technical approaches and actual sharing behavior. This article summarizes the results of a five-day Dagstuhl Seminar on mobile experience sharing and outlines future research necessary in this domain.",

   "abstract": "The demand for wireless access data rates is growing exponentially at a pace where supply cannot keep up with. Wireless resources (spectrum, time, space) are limited and shared, and transmission rates cannot be improved anymore solely with physical layer innovations. On the consumer side, flat rate type tariffs have established unnecessarily high expectations and often wasteful consumption. Dealing with congestion is unavoidable as a consequence of operating in a regime where demand is close to, equal to, or exceeding the supply. We can no longer assume that the current over-provisioning approach continues to be feasible. Complementary to the engineering for the growth of the supply side, this article focuses on the engineering for the control of the demand side. An approach referred to as the \u201cuser-in-the-loop\u201d (UIL) is therefore motivated here. This article proposes spatial control, in which the user is encouraged to move to a less congested location, and temporal control, in which incentives (e.g., dynamic pricing) ensure that the user reduces (or postpones) his current data demand in case the network is congested. Results from a survey, which measures how willing a user is to respond to such control, are also presented. As users are modeled by a system-theoretic box in a closed-loop (control) system, they feature an input handle for incentives and an output handle for the reaction. Incentives can be progressive tariffs, reward programs, higher access rates, or even environmental (green) indicators. Incentives are tailored to the major Quality-of-Service (QoS) classes and help to shape the demand at the application layer-7 as well as at the user (\u201clayer-8\u201d). UIL can safely be applied in addition to other technologies, which are mainly for increasing the supplied capacity.",

   "abstract": "Due to the large growth of mobile communications over the past two decades, cellular systems have resorted to fuller and denser reuse of bandwidth to cope with the growing demand. On one hand, this approach raises the achievable system capacity. On the other hand, however, the increased interference caused by the dense spatial reuse inherently limits the achievable network throughput. Therefore, the spectral efficiency gap between users' demand and network capabilities is ever growing. Most recently, visible light communication has been identified as well equipped to provide additional bandwidth and system capacity without aggregating the interference in the mobile network. Furthermore, energy-efficient indoor lighting and the large amount of indoor traffic can be combined inherently. In this article, VLC is examined as a viable and ready complement to RF indoor communications, and advancement toward future communications. Various application scenarios are discussed, presented with supporting simulation results, and the current technologies and challenges pertaining to VLC implementation are investigated. Finally, an overview of recent VLC commercialization is presented.",

Emerging applications and services, however, require major changes to its underlying computing and networking models, which demand new network planning for VANET. This article especially examines how VANET evolves with two emerging paradigms: vehicular cloud computing and information-centric networking. VCC brings the mobile cloud model to vehicular networks and thus changes the way of network service provisioning, whereas ICN changes the notion of data routing and dissemination. We envision a new vehicular networking system, vehicular cloud networking, on top of them. This article scrutinizes its architecture and operations, and discusses its design principles.",

   "abstract": "WWVB is a broadcast station, operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has been broadcasting time information to radio-controlled clocks (RCC) throughout the continental US since 1965. The transmitted information includes the year (excluding the century), day, hour, minute, and notifications for leap seconds and for daylight saving time (DST) transitions. By receiving this information from WWVB, RCCs can acquire and maintain accurate timing and automatically adjust for DST transitions and leap seconds. The legacy amplitude modulation (AM)-based broadcast format, introduced in the 1960s, while allowing for a simple implementation of a receiver with the technology of that era, exhibits low efficiency. Consequently, RCCs based on it often fail to receive reliably, particularly in locations that are distant from the station, such as on the East Coast. To improve the station's coverage, an enhanced broadcast format, based on the addition of phase modulation (PM), was deployed in 2012. This article presents an overview of this new broadcast format and its enhanced features, including its modulation scheme, information encoding, channel coding, and transmission modes. These features enable more reliable receiver performance and greater time-keeping accuracy at reduced power consumption. Additionally, various challenges and considerations associated with the design of receivers for the new broadcast format are presented.",

   "abstract": "A university provides diverse knowledge and expertise that can be mobilized readily in response to community needs in the event of a disaster. Due to its comprehensive capability, a university can contribute significantly in all phases of disaster cycles: pre-disaster preparedness, disaster response, and disaster recovery. It is this comprehensive strength that makes universities such an important part of our society, even in a disaster situation. This article summarizes Tohoku University's strength displayed in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. As a case study of response-phase contributions, this article also focuses on the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) project, in which authors have been involved for nearly three years.",

   "abstract": "The Internet's universality is based on its decentralization and diversity. However, its distributed nature leads to operational brittleness and difficulty in identifying the root causes of performance and availability issues, especially when the involved systems span multiple administrative domains. The first step to address this fragmentation is coordinated measurement: we propose to complement the current Internet,s data and control planes with a measurement plane, or mPlane for short. mPlane,s distributed measurement infrastructure collects and analyzes traffic measurements at a wide variety of scales to monitor the network status. Its architecture is centered on a flexible control interface, allowing the incorporation of existing measurement tools through lightweight mPlane proxy components, and offering dynamic support for new capabilities. A focus on automated, iterative measurement makes the platform well-suited to troubleshooting support. This is supported by a reasoning system, which applies machine learning algorithms to learn from success and failure in drilling down to the root cause of a problem. This article describes the mPlane architecture and shows its applicability to several distributed measurement problems involving content delivery networks and Internet service roviders. A first case study presents the tracking and iterative analysis of cache selection policies in Akamai, while a second example focuses on the cooperation between Internet service providers and content delivery networks to better orchestrate their traffic engineering decisions and jointly improve their performance.",
