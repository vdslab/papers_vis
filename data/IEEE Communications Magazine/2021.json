      "abstract": "The deployment of large-scale antenna arrays for cellular base stations (BSs), called massive MIMO, has been a key enabler for meeting the ever increasing capacity requirement for 5G communication systems and beyond. Despite their promising performance, fully digital massive MIMO systems require a large number of hardware components including radio frequency chains, power amplifiers, digital-to-analog converters (DACs), and so on, resulting in a huge increase in terms of the total power consumption and hardware costs for cellular BSs. Toward both spectrally-efficient and energy-efficient massive MIMO deployment, a number of hardware limited architectures have been proposed, including hybrid analog-digital structures, constant-envelope transmission, and the use of low-resolution DACs. In this article, we overview the recent advances in improving the error rate performance of massive MIMO systems with 1-bit DACs through precoding at the symbol level. This line of research goes beyond traditional interference suppression or cancellation techniques by managing interference on a symbol-by-symbol basis. This provides unique opportunities for interference-aware precoding tailored for practical massive MIMO systems. In this article, we first explain the concept of constructive interference (CI) and elaborate on how CI can benefit the 1-bit signal design by exploiting the traditionally undesired multi-user interference as well as the interference from imperfect hardware components. We then overview several solutions for 1-bit signal design to illustrate the gains achievable by exploiting CI. Finally, we identify some challenges and future research directions for 1-bit massive MIMO systems that have yet to be explored.",

      "abstract": "The retail industry is facing an inevitable transformation worldwide, which is accelerating with the current pandemic situation. Indeed, consumer habits are shifting from brick-and-mortar stores to online shopping. The bottleneck in the online shopping experience remains efficient and fast delivery to consumers. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is seen as a potential solution to address cargo delivery issues. Hence, the number of cargo UAVs is expected to increase in the next few decades and the airspace to become crowded. To successfully deploy UAVs for mass cargo delivery, seamless and reliable cellular connectivity for cargo UAVs is required. Thus, organized and \u201cconnected\u201d routes in the sky are needed. Like highways for vehicles, 3D routes in the airspace should be designed to fulfill cargo UAV operations safely and efficiently. We refer to these routes as \u201c3D aerial highways.\u201d In this article, we investigate the feasibility of the aerial highways paradigm. First, we discuss the related motivations and concerns. Then we present our aerial highways paradigm design. Finally, we present linked connectivity issues and potential solutions.",

      "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communications are envisioned as a critical technology for 6G and enable ultra-fast dense networks with tiny cells. Implementing THz-enabled ultra-fast cells requires new techniques due to its 3D nature. Stochastic geometry is a tool that is widely used for network deployment, which provides tractability and feasibility. In this article, we provide a summary of 3D network modeling for the THz system. We discuss the new 6G ultra-cell scenario along with a potential 3D network architecture. Several recent developments in network modeling applying a stochastic geometry-based clustered process are also presented. We also discuss several potential network modeling techniques such as Poisson Voronoi (PV) tessellation, Thomas cluster process (TCP), and Mat\u00e9rn cluster process (MCP). Subsequently, a 3D network model for THz-band ultra-cell is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss major KPIs for 3D stochastic geometry and conclude with research challenges and open issues for 3D THz architectures.",

      "abstract": "3GPP has finalized the publication of 5G specifications in Release 16, also called 5G phase 2 in 3GPP, which focuses on the enhancements of 5G basis to address more use cases in the 5G ecosystem. In Release 16, 3GPP took into account a variety of vertical markets in 5G, where security requirements and corresponding mechanisms are increasingly in focus. One of the important security features introduced in 3GPP Release 16 is the Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA), which is similar to the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) specified in earlier generations, leveraging an operator authentication infrastructure in order to secure the communication between the UE and an Application Function (AF). To help understand the origin and principles of AKMA better, this article first introduces mechanisms specified before 5G, including GBA and Battery Efficient Security for very low Throughput Machine (BEST), then presents the AKMA specification in more detail, and finally summarizes the enhancements of AKMA compared to preceding mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a key technology for enabling various services in 5G applications. Existing works mainly focus on the key technologies of MEC. In this article, we, as a mobile operator, share our experience with a self-developed MEC system, called 5G Intelligent A+, for 5G private networks. This system is inline and transparent, and is located between the base station (BS) and the mobile core network. Therefore, it is not affected by changes in the BS and core network, and does not require pre-configuration. We demonstrate the key functions of the system, including versatile conditions for local breakout, flexible network access management, on-demand bandwidth allocation based on mobile subscriber ISDN number, time, and location. We also show how to support inter-region access via an innovative tunneling mechanism called tunnel MEC (T-MEC). We then demonstrate that the system can efficiently provide enterprises with diverse services, which can be performed online and in real time. This MEC system works well with many types of access networks and is applicable to non-standalone and standalone (SA) 5G networks. The proof of concept has been tested in Taiwan to prove the flexibility and usability of the MEC system. In addition, some functions and applications were also demonstrated at the Mobile World Congress 2018 and 2019.",

Despite numerous research efforts in recent years, a systematic overview on the role of 5G NR in future connected autonomous communication networks is missing. To fill this gap and to spark more future research, this article introduces the technology components of 5G NR and discusses the evolution from existing cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology toward NR-V2X. We primarily focus on the key features and functionalities of the physical layer, sidelink communication and its resource allocation, architecture flexibility, security and privacy mechanisms, and precise positioning techniques. Moreover, we envisage and highlight the potential of machine learning for further performance enhancement in NR-V2X services. Lastly, we show how 5G NR can be configured to support advanced V2X use cases.",

Currently, several radio access network features are being further enhanced or newly introduced in NR to improve 5G's capability to provide fast, reliable, and non-limiting connectivity for transport applications. In this article, we review the most important characteristics and requirements of a wide range of services that are driven by the desire to help the transport sector to become more sustainable, economically viable, safe, and secure. These requirements will be supported by the evolving and entirely new features of 5G NR systems, including accurate positioning, reference signal design to enable multi-transmission and reception points, and service quality prediction.",

      "abstract": "Emerging 5G systems will need to seamlessly guarantee novel types of services in a multi-do-main ecosystem. New methodologies of network and infrastructure sharing facilitate the cooperation among the operators, exploiting the core and access sections of the system architecture. Network slicing (NS) is the operators' best technique for building and managing a network. Without NS, the 5G requirements in terms of flexibility, optimal resource utilization, and investment returns cannot materialize. Before slicing is commercially available, different sections of the 5G architecture should be modified to include NS. In this work, we present a novel dynamic radio access network slicing resource sharing method aimed to guarantee optimal service level agreements through the monitoring of each slice tenant's key performance indicators. The experiments are conducted following the 3GPP specifications, and the solution is validated using a testbed based on the main 5G functionalities.",

      "abstract": "At the core of digital transformation of the manufacturing industry is the objective to unlock data at multiple points of the production system and produce insights to improve and optimize all aspects of the business operations. Tremendous advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning make it possible to analyze a vast volume of the field and production data and translate them into optimization decisions. Real-time access to the data complements efficient machine learning inference for timely and actionable insights. Flexible and re-configurable manufacturing also demands high-performance, pervasive, and low-la-tency communication links supporting mobility of workers, devices, and robots. Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) introduced basic support for Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communication (urLLC) in Release-15 through intrinsic design features. Release-16 extends real-time capabilities of 5G NR to different verticals, addressing use cases in factory automation, the transport industry, and electrical power distribution. Wireless technologies such as 5G urLLC should co-exist with incumbent and emerging industrial Ethernet systems such as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) in a heterogenous networking architecture. Hence, specification of interworking with TSN is also part of 3GPP Release-16. In this article, we discuss low-latency and high-reliability features supporting industrial automation, focusing on Release-16 design specifications. The interworking aspects with TSN and time synchronization accuracy limits are also highlighted, followed by performance evaluation of control and data traffic channels of 5G NR with respect to urLLC requirements.",

However, interoperability among involved stakeholders, seamless connectivity, and the uninterrupted delivery of real-time services across borders are issues that should be carefully analyzed for the realization of cross-border CCAM services. This article provides an overview of key standardization bodies by analyzing recent work on key technologies to provide cross-border connectivity services for CCAM. Standardization gaps and regulatory barriers that may affect fast and efficient adoption of 5G-enabled CCAM services are also discussed.",

Several countries have adopted proximity-based (short-range) technologies, such as Bluetooth, which, however, appear to be hindered by deployment issues, security leakage, lack of reliability, and data governance concerns. This article posits that 5G and beyond can play a primary role in contact tracing and group movement monitoring. Contact tracing based on 5G location-based analytics benefits from the pervasive deployment of cellular networks, the several years of effort to design cellular standards for localization and analytics, and the best practices of cellular operators to handle location data.",

      "abstract": "Discovering important knowledge that may be available from databases while preserving the privacy of sensitive information is a hot research subject in data mining recently. With the establishment of 5G, several data-intensive applications will be developed. Privacy of information over the network is increasingly relevant, and as edge computing has grown more critical, applications running over drone networks require protection. The privacy of information while utilizing data is a trade-off that needs to be addressed. In this article, a deep-reinforcement-learning-based technique is applied to hide the sensitive information from a given database while keeping the balance between privacy protection and knowledge discovery during the sanitization process. Furthermore, minimizing known side effects that can be caused in the sanitization process is also considered. A particular set of recommendations, along with potential applications, are discussed with use cases.",

Specifically, we present multiple vertical pilots (Industry 4.0, transportation, and energy), identify the key 5G requirements to enable them, and analyze existing technical and functional gaps as compared to current solutions. Based on the identified gaps, we propose a set of innovations to address them with: (i) support of 3GPP-based RAN slices by introducing a RAN slicing model and providing automated RAN orchestration and control; (ii) an AI-driven closed-loop for automated service management with service level agreement assurance; and (iii) multi-domain solutions to expand service offerings by aggregating services and resources from different provider domains and also enable the integration of private 5G networks with public networks.",

These applications are required to adapt human-centric approach to make the most of human intuition and intelligence in Industry 4.0 automation.It calls for a transdisciplinarity research domain to investigate innovative systems with overlapping realms of Psychology, Sociology, Communication networks, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Collaborative Computing. The author at the Cognitive Systems Research Centre, London South Bank University has coined the expression \u201c3C Systems\u201d to refer to such artifacts which stands for \u201cCollabora-tive Cognitive Communication Systems.\u201d In this article, an innovative framework for 3C Systems is proposed that is able to analyze and predict both the human as well as machine behaviors. It proactively diagnoses issues and recommends solutions without requiring any human intervention. The proposed concept of 3C Systems would potentially contribute towards 6G standardization. The automation and orchestration aspects of this research have variety of applications stretched across city infrastructures, retail, business, tourism, health, law, education and travel. A thorough insight to a broad view of 6G vision has been presented towards envisioned 3C Systems, while covering its enabling technologies. The experimental results for the proof of concept implementation has been presented. Results affirm the technical capabilities of the concept, to contribute to several industry 5.0 applications including, but not limited to holographic communication, self-driving vehicles, context-aware infrastructure and personalized interfaces.",

Future 6G networks will need to deliver quality of experience through seamless integration of communication, computation, and AI. Therefore, networks must become intelligent, distributed, scalable, and programmable platforms across the continuum of data delivery to address the ever increasing service requirements and deployment complexity. We present novel results across three research directions that are expected to be integral to 6G systems, and also discuss newer 6G metrics.",

To meet such contrasting requirements, 5G networks rely on its new radio interface (5G-NR) to address eMBB and URLLC services and on LTE-M and NB-IoT for mMTC services. As of Release 16, 5G networks effectively support the extreme ends of key performance indicators, namely bandwidth, reliability, latency, coverage, and autonomy. This article analyzes the gap between those capabilities and the requirements of use cases as discussed in the NR-REDCAP 3GPP Study Item of Release 17: video surveillance, industrial IoT, and wearables, to name a few. This article further discusses the challenges driving the design of this new air interface for reduced-capability 5G devices in the sub-6 GHz band and key enablers to fulfill those use case requirements.",

Gradually, such devices are enriched with additional capabilities (e.g., sense, learn, reason, move, act on the environment) beyond classic connectivity services. However, there are no unified and coherent software architectures to seamlessly integrate and manage high-end devices. This work envisages a novel architectural framework, ITHACA: IoT High-end Autonomous Cooper-Ative framework, for 5G and beyond communications toward seamless integration of autonomous and intelligent devices. The framework offers necessary functional enrichments on top of existing architecture involving functions, mechanisms, algorithms, and protocols. The usefulness of the proposed ITHACA framework is corroborated considering a recent Industry 4.0 use case of aerial robotics pertaining to design of an intelligent industrial infrastructure inspection system.",

Each vertical has its own requirements in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs) for their applications. Mapping the verticals KPIs into network quality of service (QoS) parameters and enforcing it at the network level is a complex procedure. Network slicing allows the deployment of multiple virtual networks (one per vertical) to work in parallel with their specific QoS based on the KPIs. This article presents and experimentally validates a KPI-enabled network function virtualization (NFV) management and orchestration (MANO) architecture able to manage network slices, to monitor the vertical KPI requirements and react in case they are not met. We address this objective from a holistic perspective, defining the network QoS parameters that enable meeting vertical KPIs along all levels of the NFV MANO architecture: the NSs using the 5G QoS Identifier parameter, the NFV network services using service level agreements, and the networking and computing services with QoS parameters. Finally, the described architecture is validated through an experimental use case based on a vertical realtime communications application.",

      "abstract": "Although molecular communication systems have been shown to bear great potential for many useful in-body applications, they require the intervention, action, or input of an out-of-body actor. From an Internet of Bio-Nano Things perspective, a successful overall network aims to bring together the two links belonging to the in-body and out-of-body networks for end-to-end communications. For most applications, the uplink from the in-body sensor is more significant since it provides the multi-scalar connection required to relay the information sensed and carried by the molecular communication system to a macro-scale smart terminal. This article proposes two different mechanisms to sense the output of the molecular communication system and transmit the information to an on-body reader. Each mechanism involves different genetically engineered bacteria and specific antenna designs. An experimental setup is provided to demonstrate each proposed concept. The results constitute a proof of concept to detect the in-body bacterial activity from the on-body reader.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is used in various fields, including many types of critical infrastructure, such as smart grids. Recently, studies have dealt with privacy preservation in smart grids. One such study presented a privacy-preserving aggregation system that provides integrity and anonymity using blockchain technology in a smart grid. In earlier work, a Bloom filter was used for rapid authentication on the blockchain, and a key management center was used for user key management. However, due to its high dependence on the key management center, it was not able to provide a completely distributed environment, and there was a linkability problem. In addition, there was a limitation in that key revocation and update functions through the Bloom filter could not be provided. In this article, we propose a decentralized privacy-preserving ID scheme that provides a fully distributed environment to address the limitations of existing research. The proposed scheme provides unlinkability to protect the anonymity of users using a blind signature. It also provides update or revocation functionalities of the pseudonym by the counting Bloom filter or the revoked-pseudonym Bloom filter. In addition, fully distributed operation is guaranteed through the certification authority responsible for user key management. Our scheme is applicable not only to blockchain-based decentralized privacy-preserving systems such as billing systems in a smart grid or smart cities, but also to any critical infrastructure, such as banks, hospitals, and systems including e-bulletins, e-surveys, e-voting, and so on.",

      "abstract": "In beyond 5G communications, besides energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE), latency and reliability are among the main metrics that extreme ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) applications must fulfill. Although new techniques are sought after to meet the crunching requirements of URLLC, combining existing phys-ical-layer techniques have become a compelling, attractive, and cost saving approach to achieving the same goal. In this article, we describe a novel mechanism combining physical layer network coding (PNC) and index modulation (IM) to achieve a balance between SE and EE for URLLC applications beyond 5G. PNC has the potential to increase SE because it leverages on interference from many transmissions occurring at the same time. Although fewer resources are required for IM the capacity gain is the same as if all transmission resources are used, and as a result, both EE and SE can increase simultaneously. Our simulation results show the feasibility of combining these two key physical-lay-er techniques, affirming the complementary role this approach will play in meeting the performance KPIs of URLLC beyond 5G.",

      "abstract": "The internet of Drones (IoD) can encompass many essential services, including surveillance and emergency/rescue operations. While IoD is becomin popular and experiencing a rapid usage increase, privacy and security are the main concerns to avoid leakage of critical information and/or denial of services by a single drone or a whole IoD network. In addition to traditional privacy cum security issues, the physical capture of a single drone can severely impact the entire IoD network. This article provides an overview of the security challenges and requirements for IoD environments in addition to a discussion related to IoD communication/security standards. More-over, this article proposes a novel scheme for securing IoD specifically, from physical drone capturing and related attacks.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth in distributed energy sources on power grids leads to increasingly decentralized energy management systems for the prediction of power supply and demand and the dynamic setting of an energy price signal. Within this emerging smart grid paradigm, electric vehicles can serve as consumers, transporters, and providers of energy through two-way charging stations, which highlights a critical feedback loop between the movement patterns of these vehicles and the state of the energy grid. This article proposes a vision for an Internet of Mobile Energy (IoME), where energy and information flow seamlessly across the power and transport sectors to enhance the grid stability and end-user welfare. We identify the key challenges of trust, scalability, and privacy, particularly location and energy linking privacy for EV owners, for realizing the IoME vision. We propose an information architecture for IoME that uses scalable blockchain to provide energy data integrity and authenticity, and introduces one-time keys for public EV transactions and a verifiable anonymous trip extraction method for EV users to share their trip data while protecting their location privacy. We present an example scenario that details the seamless and closed loop information flow across the energy and transport sectors, along with a blockchain design and transaction vocabulary for trusted decentralised transactions. We finally discuss the open challenges presented by IoME that can unlock significant benefits to grid stability, innovation, and end-user welfare.",

      "abstract": "Extended reality (XR)-aided teleoperation has shown its potential in improving operating efficiency in mission-critical, information-rich, and complex scenarios. The multi-sensory XR devices introduce several new types of traffic with unique quality of service (QoS) requirements, which are usually defined by three measures: human perception, corresponding sensors, and present devices. To fulfill these requirements, cellular-supported wireless connectivity can be a promising solution that can largely benefit robot-to-XR and XR-to-robot links. In this article, we present industrial and piloting use cases and identify the service bottleneck of each case. We then cover the QoS of robot-XR and XR-robot links by summarizing the sensors' parameters and processing procedures. To realize these use cases, we introduce potential solutions for each case with cellular connections. Finally, we build testbeds to investigate the effectiveness of supporting our proposed links using current wireless topologies.",

      "abstract": "Recently, significant research attention has been devoted to the study of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are capable of reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment by exploiting the unique properties of metamaterials-based integrated large arrays of inexpensive antennas. Existing research demonstrates that RISs significantly improve physical layer performance, including wireless coverage, achievable data rate, and energy efficiency. However, the medium access control (MAC) of multiple users accessing an RIS-enabled channel is still in its infancy, while many open issues remain to be addressed. In this article, we present four typical RIS-aided multi-user scenarios with special emphasis on the MAC schemes. We then propose and elaborate on centralized, distributed, and hybrid artificial-in-telligence-assisted MAC architectures in RIS-aid-ed multi-user communications systems. Finally, we discuss some challenges, perspectives, and potential applications of RISs as they are related to MAC design.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of wireless and mobile networks is growing at an unprecedented pace. This trend is proving current network control and management techniques based on analytical models and simulations to be impractical, especially if combined with the data deluge expected from future applications such as augmented reality. This is particularly true for software-defined wireless local area networks (SO-WLANs). It is our belief that to battle this growing complexity, future SO-WLANs must follow an artificial intelligence (AI) -native approach. In this article, we introduce aiOS, which is an AI-based platform that builds toward the autonomous management of SD-WLANs. Our proposal is aligned with the most recent trends in in-network AI promoted by the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and with the architecture for disaggregated radio access networks promoted by the Open Radio Access Network Alliance. We validate aiOS in a practical use case, namely frame size optimization in SD-WLANs, and we consider the long-term evolution, challenges, and scenarios for AI-assisted network automation in the wireless and mobile networking domain.",

      "abstract": "5G is expected to bring forth disruptive indus-trial-societal transformation by enabling a broad catalog of (radically new, highly heterogeneous) applications and services. This scenario has called for zero-touch network and service management (ZSM). With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, key ZSM capabilities such as the runtime prediction of user demands can be facilitated by data-driven and machine learning methods. In this respect, the article proposes a runtime prediction approach that transforms time series forecasting into a simpler multivariate regression problem with artificial neural networks (ANNs), structurally optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA) metaheuristic. Leveraging on a novel set of input features that capture seasonality and calendar effects, the proposed approach removes the prediction accuracy's dependence on the temporal succession of input data and the forecast horizon. Evaluation results based on real telecommunications data show that the GA-optimized ANN regressor has better prediction performance. It achieved average improvements of ~59 percent and ~86 percent compared to 1-day and 1-hour ahead forecasts obtained with state-of-the-art multi-seasonal time series and long short-term memory forecasting models, respectively. Furthermore, despite its longer training times compared to the baseline models, the proposed ANN regressor relaxes the monitoring requirements in 5G dynamic management systems by allowing less frequent retraining offline.",

      "abstract": "Software-defined networking creates new opportunities for automated network security management by providing a global network view and a standard interface for configuring network policies. Previously, we proposed a general framework, called ATMoS, for autonomous threat mitigation using reinforcement learning (RL) in software-defined networks. Using a suitable set of host simulations and based on observations from an arbitrary network monitoring infrastructure, ATMoS can autonomously mitigate threats by moving hosts between a set of virtual networks that embody different network policies. In this article, we propose ATMoS+, which extends the RL agent in ATMoS with a novel Deep Q-Network architecture. The deep RL agent in ATMoS+ leverages permutation-invariant and permutation-equivariant set functions to relax previous assumptions on the number of network hosts and their ordering. We showcase that the proposed deep RL agent is scalable and generalizes to an arbitrary-sized network without additional retraining, scales with the number of hosts, and accommodates several different types of threat alerts.",

      "abstract": "The digital revolution is expected to surpass all previous economic transformations in scale, scope, and complexity. Digital technologies are making electrical grids more connected, more reliable, and sustainable. Several efforts have been made to revamp the electric grid and modernize century-old systems. In the near future, we expect to see a revolution in power grind monitoring with incredible results through artificial intelligence and big data, drones, among others. The business opportunity for using drones in the energy sector is impressive, although very few companies have joined in its implementation. The drone allows the safe remote overflight of high voltage power lines. They can be deployed to detect, inspect, and diagnose the defects of the power line infrastructure. In this article, we provide the state of the art of using drones in smart grid monitoring. We demonstrate and propose an architecture based on Faster R-CNN for detecting ice accretion on power lines. Finally, we shed light on opportunities and future trends of these emerging technologies that can guide future research directions.",

In order to achieve this, the following concepts are important: first, to have a technical insight on the 5G technology and to understand better its advantages; second, to understand the specific needs and requirements of the use cases; and third, to know from an implementation point of view how to match the 5G technical features with the needs of the use cases. In this context, the main focus of this article is to describe the implementation approach followed to deliver 5G services to specific use cases with concrete high throughput and low latency requirements, and to present the current lessons learned, challenges, and open issues identified. This article uses as reference the integration work done by the authors of the Horizon 2020 projects, where the target is to design and implement an advanced and accessible 5G facility (5G-VINNI), and validate vertical use cases by the use of 5G technology (5G-HEART), providing the technology, use cases, and integration knowledge needed to understand better how to bring from theory to practice the 5G technology into the verticals world.",

      "abstract": "Emerging AI-empowered services and techniques, such as connected vehicle, intelligent industry, and smart city, are forthcoming with the sixth generation (6G) cellular network to benefit daily life, industry, and society. However, the increasing integration of the 6G network with the physical world leads to a plethora of new scenarios that bring new challenges to 6G, especially from the security and energy aspects. In 5G networks, security solutions across all devices and base stations are configured with universal settings for certain types of attacks. This one-size-fit-all strategy no longer suits 6G security due to the higher diversity in device capabilities, service features, energy conditions, attack vulnerabilities, and other time-varying attributes. Since each scenario may have unique security requirements and energy availability, the selection and configuration of security strategies need to be optimized for 6G networks in an adaptive and dynamic manner. In this article, we explore 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective by balancing the tradeoff between security and energy consumption in various scenarios. Specifically, we first investigate the AI-empowered 6G network architecture with promising applications and visions. Then we identify the challenges for adaptive and dynamic security optimization in 6G from the aspects of heterogeneity, dynamics, and modeling complexity. To balance security-energy trade-off, we propose an optimization framework that provides customized recommendations of security strategy to different user devices and base stations. Finally, open issues are discussed on 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective.",

      "abstract": "Today, a large portion of mobile data traffic is consumed behind the shielding walls of buildings or in the Faraday cage of trains. This renders cellular network coverage from outdoor cell sites difficult. Indoor small cells and distributed antennas along train tracks are often considered as a solution, but the cost and the need for optical fiber backhaul are often prohibitive. To alleviate this issue, we describe an out-of-band repeater that converts a sub-6 GHz cell signal from a small cell installed at a cell tower to an mmWave frequency for the fronthaul to buildings or distributed antenna sites, where the signal is downconverted to the original frequency and emitted, for example, inside a building. This concept does not require fiber deployment, provides backward compatibility to equipment already in use, and additional indoor capacity is gained while outdoor networks are offloaded. The architecture and hardware prototype implementation is described, and measurements are reported to demonstrate the functionality and compatibility with commercial infrastructure and mobile terminals.",

      "abstract": "Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is one of the key enabling vehicular communication technologies endorsed by the vehicular industry, scientists, and researchers. Introduced by the 3GPP, LTE device-to-device in Release 12 evolved into C-V2X with mode 3 and mode 4. In mode 4, semi-persistent -scheduling-based sensing is performed by vehicles to select resources. However, when the density of vehicles increases, the performance of C-V2X mode 4 degrades. To address this challenge, 3GPP Release 16 introduced New Radio (NR) for V2X services, also known as NR-V2X. Modes 1 and 2 along with four additional sub-modes were considered in NR-V2X to achieve high reliability and higher throughput with low latency. This article discusses and evaluates the advancements introduced in NR-V2X by comparative analysis with C-V2X. To compare the performance, an NR-V2X simulator based on a network simulator (ns-3) for sub-6 GHz band is also introduced. In addition, feasible practical solutions to resolve resource selection problems are also discussed.",

Alternatively, reconfigurable smart surfaces (RSS), which smartly exploit/recycle signal reflections in the environment, are increasingly being recognized as a new wireless communication paradigm to improve communication links. In fact, their reduced cost, low power use, light weight, and flexible deployment make them an attractive candidate for integration with 5G/B5G technologies. In this article, we discuss comprehensive approaches to the integration of RSS in aerial platforms. First, we present a review of RSS technology, its operations, and types of communication. Next, we describe how RSS can be used in aerial platforms, and we propose a control architecture workflow. Then several potential use cases are presented and discussed. Finally, associated research challenges are identified.",

      "abstract": "Communication networks and the systems they interconnect are going through a phase of tremendous change. The former agnostic delivery of content between endpoints has given way to networks increasingly adding functionality beyond moving data. Softwarization technologies including network function virtualization (NFV) and soft-ware-defined networking (SDN) are key enablers that introduce computing into the network. This revolution, especially for mobile communication networks, represents a major paradigm shift away from agnostic data delivery. Subsequently, there is a significant need to provide well-defined environments offering replicability to effectively test and evaluate protocols and mechanisms that integrate computing into networks. This article presents the Communication Networks Emulator (ComNetsEmu), which provides an SDN and NFV network emulation environment based on community-embraced open source packages and enables replicable research and development on limited resource commodity hardware. In this article, we describe the underlying ComNetsEmu architecture and provide a hands-on description of its use for researchers, practitioners, and educators alike.",

The objective of the study is to investigate the capability of LTE networks for providing connectivity to UAVs. In this article, we provide an overview of the key findings of the 3GPP Release 15 study item. We first introduce UAV connectivity requirements and performance evaluation scenarios defined in the study. We then discuss radio channel models and the key identified challenges of using LTE networks to provide connectivity to UAVs. We summarize potential solutions to address the challenges, including interference detection and mitigation techniques, mobility enhancements, and UAV identification. Finally, we also shed light on the key features standardized during the Release 15 work item and provide directions for future work in the area of 5G NR.",

Supporting accessibility differentiation therefore becomes essential to preserve a stable network condition during high traffic load, while ensuring connection and service quality to prioritized devices and services. In this article, we describe some use cases and requirements that impact the 3GPP design of the 5G accessibility differentiation frame-work. We then provide an overview of the supported mechanisms for accessibility differentiation and control in 5G standalone systems, including cell barring and reservation, unified access control, paging control, random access control, and admission control. We discuss how these functionalities can be used to maintain the service quality and selectively limit the incoming traffic to the network in high load situations, leveraging different connection-type indicators and connection-priority identifiers.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communication is facing an ever increasing thirst for high-quality data transmission. However, this imposes high demands on the radio access networks (RANs), where optical fiber has been widely used for both the backhaul and fronthaul. However, the explosive escalation of wireless tele-traffic tests the limits of the RAN's revenue vs. cost trade-off, which motivates low-cost designs. Hence, we present a cost-efficient but high-performance radio over fiber (RoF)-aided RAN concept. We commence by introducing this motivation, followed by a brief introduction to analog RoF (A-RoF) and digitized RoF (D-RoF), as well as to wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. Then we present the centralized RAN (C-RAN) concept relying on A-RoF-aided MIMO signal processing, where the MIMO signal is carried by fiber and processed optically in a central unit. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a C-RAN small cell application followed by our performance vs. cost analysis of the A-RoF system compared to that of its baseband counterparts, demonstrating that the A-RoF design is capable of reducing the RAN's total cost while meeting the Third Generation Partnership Project's requirements.",

      "abstract": "Smart railway is in the process of vigorous development based on the advancement of numerous emerging and advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence and big data. However, a smart railway network is exceedingly time-varying and complicated, which presents great challenges to power allocation. Deep reinforcement learning is capable of effectually improving the intelligence as well as cognition of high-speed railway network, which helps to optimize the power allocation problems with both time-varying and complicated characteristics. In this article, we first provide an overview of the existing power allocation methods, including advantages, disadvantages, and complexity, as well as characteristics. Then we investigate an innovative power allocation algorithm based on multi-agent deep recurrent deterministic policy gradient (MADRDPG), which is capable of learning power decisions from past experience instead of an accurate mathematical model. Finally, numerical results indicate that the performance of the MADRDPG-based method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectrum efficiency and execution latency.",

This article investigates the architectures of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks experimental prototypes with a focus on network slicing. We present some existing 5G prototypes and identify their gaps. We then propose an architecture and a design of a 5G micro-service-based prototype. This prototype has the ability to autoconfigure radio resources for network slices using machine-learning-powered decisions based on real-time acquired performance metrics. Finally, we discuss some use cases on top of this prototype and their related results before concluding.",

However, autonomous D2D communication introduces challenging technical issues, and how to achieve the benefit and cooperation of users is an unsolved issue. To address this problem, we propose a novel concept of a bandwidth market called Banket for building a sharing economy in mobile networks. It provides an auction-based free marketplace for mobile users to buy and sell mobile bandwidth without cooperation with network operators. The contribution of the proposed Banket is to achieve dynamic and complete autonomous D2D communication established by market mechanisms without intervention. Banket prompts users to efficiently use network resources, and consequently achieves cost reduction for network operators and social profit by reducing resource and energy consumption. The validity of the proposed auction-based transaction scheme is confirmed through computer simulations. Furthermore, the feasibility of Banket is validated with experimental results using implemented applications.",

      "abstract": "The transport layer is ossified. With most of the research and deployment efforts in the past decade focusing on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and its extensions, the QUIC standardization by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is to be finalized in early 2021. In addition to addressing the most urgent issues of TCP, QUIC ensures its future extendibility and is destined to drastically change the transport protocol landscape. In this work, we present a first look at emerging protocols and their IETF standardization efforts beyond QUIC v1. While multiple proposed extensions improve on QUIC itself, Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption (MASQUE) as well as WebTransport present different approaches to address long-standing problems, and their interplay expands on QUIC's take to address transport layer ossification challenges.",

      "abstract": "There has been intense concern for security alternatives because of the recent rise of cyber attacks, mainly targeting critical systems such as industry, medical, and energy ecosystems. Although the latest industry infrastructures largely depend on AI-driven maintenance, prediction based on corrupted data undoubtedly results in loss of life and capital. Admittedly, an inadequate data protection mechanism can readily challenge the security and reliability of the network. The shortcomings of the conventional cloud or trust-ed-certificate-driven techniques have motivated us to exhibit a unique blockchain-based framework for a secure and efficient Industry 4.0 system. The demonstrated framework obviates the long-established certificate authority after enhancing the consortium blockchain that reduces the data processing delay and increases cost-effective throughput. Nonetheless, the distributed Industry 4.0 security model entails cooperative trust rather than depending on a single party, which in essence indulges the costs and threat of the single point of failure. Therefore, the multi-signature technique of the proposed framework accomplishes multi-party authentication, which confirms its applicability for a real-time and collaborative cyber-physical system.",

      "abstract": "Collaborative inference helps robots to complete large tasks with mutual collaboration in edge-assisted multi-robot systems. It is challenging to provide trusted edge collaborative inference in the presence of malicious nodes. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based collaborative edge knowledge inference (BCEI) framework for edge-assisted multi-robot systems. First, we formulate the inference process at the edge as the collaborative knowledge graph construction and sharing model. Second, to guarantee the trust of knowledge sharing, an efficient knowledge-based blockchain consensus method is presented. Finally, we conduct a case study on the emergency rescue application to evaluate the proposed framework. The experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in terms of latency and accuracy.",

In this article, we propose a novel controller-based architecture to deploy adaptive causal network coding in heterogeneous and highly meshed communication networks. Specifically, we consider using the software-defined network as the main controller. We first present an architecture for highly meshed heterogeneous multi-source multi-destination networks that represent the practical communication networks encountered in the fifth generation of wireless networks and beyond. Next, we present a promising solution to deploy network coding over the new architecture. We also present a new controller-based setting with which network coding modules communicate to attain the required information. Finally, we briefly discuss how the proposed architecture and network coding solution provide a good opportunity for future technologies.",

      "abstract": "Wireless traffic prediction is of great significance in wireless networks and communication systems, and has been widely studied. However, the theoretical limits of this prediction remain open, especially on whether the theoretical limit is valid and whether it can be approached by the actual prediction algorithm. This article performs voice traffic predictability analysis based on real entropy and five mainstream prediction models to answer this unsolved question. We have two findings in this research: Predictability can be considered as the theoretical guidance on prediction accuracy, and the prediction performance of state-of-the-art models and algorithms still have gaps to the prediction bound. Using two kinds of real-world voice traffic data, the prediction performance of the most frequent visit models - multi-order Markov chains, multi-order diffusion kernel models, multi-order SVM, and LSTM - are obtained and discussed. The most frequent visit model and LSTM model have the best prediction effects on users' traffic and base stations' Erlang, respectively. This work enriches the understanding and application of predictability theory and sheds new insight on voice traffic prediction issues.",

Digitalized, frictionless, and growth-enabling support system journeys become imperative. This article builds on the analysis of users&amp;#x0027; challenges and requirements when accessing support systems and proposes an architectural design for the 5G platforms&amp;#x0027; system support stack. It suggests the most important capabilities that 5G business support systems and operation support systems should have and explains why they are important from the perspective of pre-commercial 5G testbeds/experimental platforms. Our study focuses on the three main actors interacting with such platforms, namely the MNO/CSP, which operates and contributes infrastructure to the testbed; the vertical enterprise customer, who consumes services for performing experiments; and the third-party service provider, which complements the testbed by offering its own services through the platform or performs testing of its services under realistic conditions.",

      "abstract": "Network planning involves link budget and capacity management to ensure scalability since adequate capacity is necessary to support coverage expansion and traffic demand increases. The primary objective in network standardization is to minimize implementation costs while maintaining a desired level of service. The harsh outdoor environment of millimeter-wave propagation is subject to various uncontrollable factors that can significantly affect network performance and reliability. This is particularly problematic for drones that support life-saving telemedicine applications, especially when many accidents take place under heavy rainfall, making standardization particularly challenging. Our study compares a number of deployment options such as variation of modulation schemes and differences of carrier frequencies between 10, 30, and 50 GHz. The selected frequencies cover a broad range of options for 5G implementation that serves as a backbone network for standardizing communication networks for mission-critical telemedicine drone services.",

      "abstract": "For realizing an intelligent transport system, a vast amount of raw image data is required to train various intelligent applications on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A capsule network performs well in the computer vision area with fewer model parameters compared to convolutional neural networks. Due to the small-scale model, multi-access edge computing (MEC) devices can support online training for the whole capsule network model. In this article, we propose a novel framework for MEC-based capsule network (CapsMEC) distributed learning for IoV applications. Capsules in CapsMEC are specially designed to train in a collaborative way, which relieves the network pressure in MEC and the time-consuming training time of the traditional capsule network. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

These infrastructures involve multiple devices that utilize different communication technologies to increase the overall operational efficiency. Rooting from the key implementation requirements of a smart factory environment, this article focuses on the role of cellular connectivity and wearable technology in enabling new industrial applications. Specifically, we shed light on a novel category of services - industrial mid-end wearable applications - by positioning their requirements among the 5G service classes. We then identify features that can complement cellular connectivity to further support the given requirements. More precisely, we review cellu-lar-network-aided device-to-device communications and reduced-capability devices. Our performance evaluation results justify the choice of these features and show that they can work in concert with cellular connectivity to enhance spectral efficiency and reliability in industrial mid-end wearable applications.",

      "abstract": "To tackle the sub-optimization problem of the conventional block structure communication systems, recently, a novel concept named end-to-end communication system that can optimize the whole system jointly has been proposed. A channel autoencoder (AE) is one of the methods, which regards the wireless communication system as an AE along with a channel model. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements of channel AEs, whose practicability mainly depends on the robustness of the impairments in actual channels. Among existing works, assuming the imperfect channel models before training or constructing a communication system without channel models are both viable methods to deal with channel impairments. Therefore, we divide the channel AEs into two categories, model-assumed and model-free channel AEs, for each of which a universal structure is investigated, namely radio transformer network and gradient generation network, respectively. Then their performance is compared extensively, and the open research issues are discussed in the end to provide some directions for future study.",

      "abstract": "Community networks (CNs) have become an important paradigm for providing essential Internet connectivity in unserved and underserved areas across the world. However, an indispensable part of CNs is network management, where responsive and autonomous maintenance is much needed. With the technological advancement in telecommunications networks, a classical satellite-dependent CN is envisioned to be transformed into a satellite-integrated CN (SICN), which will embrace significant autonomy, intelligence, and scalability in network management. This article discusses the machine learning (ML)-based hierarchical approach to enabling autonomous self-maintenance for SICNs. The approach is split into the anomaly identification and anomaly mitigation phases, where the related ML methods, data collection means, deployment options, and mitigation schemes are presented. With the case study, we discuss a typical scenario using satellite and fixed connections as backhaul options and show the effectiveness and performance improvements of the proposed approach with recurrent neural network and ensemble methods.",

We consider this is necessary to achieve all sorts of cooperative tasks requiring real-time (or near-real-time) synchronization, including swarm formation and collision avoidance. In this article, we therefore argue in favor of introducing a new standard that would address this specific area, highlighting why current technologies are not adequate, what the different steps toward rapid standardization are, and which lessons have been learned from related fields, namely the vehicular and robotic environments, in the past few years.",

      "abstract": "An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) consists of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and its controller, which use radios to communicate. While the remote controller (RC) is traditionally operated by a person who is maintaining visual line of sight with the UAV it controls, the trend is moving toward long-range control and autonomous operation. To enable this, reliable and widely available wireless connectivity is needed because it is the only way to remotely control a UAV or take control of an autonomous UAV flight. This article surveys the ongoing Third Generation Partnership Project standardization activities for enabling networked UASs. In particular, we present the requirements, envisaged architecture, and services to be offered to/by UAVs and RCs, which will communicate with one another, with the UAS traffic management (UTM), and with other users through cellular networks. Critical research directions relate to security and spectrum coexistence, among others. We identify major R&amp;D platforms that will drive the standardization of cellular communications networks and applications.",

      "abstract": "Driven by their versatility and autonomy, advanced unmanned aerial systems have indicated substantial promise along the development of current communication networks, as well as in support of new communication platforms. The resulting integration of robotic and communication systems brings increased levels of complexity, which cannot be modeled accurately by conventional approaches. An example of this are aerial synthetic aperture antennas, in which an aerial robotic swarm coordinates their flight patterns and communication exchanges to produce a synthetic aperture. The accurate representation of such a system mandates the careful simulation of wireless communications, antenna radiation patterns, flight dynamics, and even environmental conditions. This article details an integrated communications and robotics simulation framework, which enables the assessment of these emerging systems. The benefits of this new approach are illustrated for the aerial synthetic aperture antenna example, but extend to a wide array of problems stemming from the union of communications and robotics. This novel modeling platform makes it possible to design and analyze joint flight and communication protocols for unmanned aerial systems. The obtained results provide valuable insights into the operation of swarm-based synthetic aperture antennas. Moreover, the methodology introduced in this work is flexible and can be readily applied to other instances of joint communication and robotic systems.",

      "abstract": "Emerging programmable data planes enable us to modify switch behavior using software abstractions. However, developing the data plane software is challenging and typically made in a monolithic manner. We argue that the data plane should be developed modularly and employ additional abstractions to compose data plane programs and steer packets between them. This article presents Programming In-Network Modular Extensions (PRIME), a mechanism to compose data plane program modules and define how to steer traffic through these modules. Additionally, the system employs techniques to ensure that updating the steering configuration is consistent according to end-to-end forwarding guarantees. We deployed use cases with existing P4 programs on BMv2, and the results show that PRIME can compose programs with small overheads in terms of latency, the number of forwarding tables, and parser states.",

Besides the performance enhancements and new advances in radio technologies, it also integrates other technological domains, such as cloud-to-things continuum and artificial intelligence. In this work, the 5G-DIVE Elastic Edge Platform (DEEP) is proposed as the linking piece for the integration of these technological domains, making available an intelligent edge and fog 5G end-to-end solution. This solution brings numerous benefits to vertical industries by enabling streamlined, abstracted, and automated management of their vertical services, thus contributing to the introduction of novel services, cost savings, and improved time to market. Preliminary validation of the proposed platform is performed through a proof of concept, along with a qualitative analysis of its benefits for Industry 4.0 and autonomous drone scouting vertical industries.",

      "abstract": "5G wireless has ushered in new promises of improved performance and ubiquitous connectivity. However, a continuous increase in connected devices and the proliferation of the Internet of Things have already created skepticism about the capacity of 5G wireless to satisfy the huge data requirements across a myriad of devices. This has made wireless researchers, vendors, and standards bodies look beyond 5G wireless by extending 5G New Radio (NR) in unlicensed bands. Operation in unlicensed bands requires additional channel sensing and fairness across different types of networks. This makes power consumption in battery-constrained mobile devices more challenging. In this article, we introduce two different aspects of discontinuous reception (DRX) for energy and resource savings in 5G NR unlicensed networks. As 5G NR is based on directional beams, the proposed solutions are based on beam searching and beam awareness. Beam-aware DRX explores next generation NodeB's assistance to alleviate mobile user equipment's (UE's) beam searching burden and results in more power saving. Simulation experiments using real wireless traces demonstrate that our NR-U DRX solutions significantly improve UE's power saving and network resource utilization over existing 5G NR DRX.",

      "abstract": "Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) facilitate remote monitoring and control of various underground environments, which are suffering from a significant reliability problem. To address this problem and relieve the ongoing networking challenges, we propose a new concept, called the magnetic induction (MI)-assisted wireless powered underground sensor network (MI-WPUSN), which integrates the advantages of MI communication techniques with those of wireless power transfer mechanisms. MI-WPUSN offers a unique platform consisting of seven envisioned devices and four distinct communication modes to provide significant reliability potential, which is constrained by its complex and challenging data collection. To unlock the potential of MI-WPUSN, we provide a systematic research roadmap for MI-WPUSN data collection, spreading from sensor deployment to multiple channel access control and to frequency-selective routing establishment. Specifically, we first summarize the state-of-the-art research advances on sensor deployment, based on which we propose a bidirectional projection-based deployment topology that achieves high network reliability and discuss the sensor numerical determination problem resorting to weighted Voronoi diagrams. We then introduce the principles for multiple channel access control and review the existing research. Finally, after introducing kernel regression methods that can easily handle the frequency-selective property of MI-WPUSN, we develop a modified Q-learning-based routing protocol. In particular, we list and analyze the underlying challenges and related future issues in each direction.",

      "abstract": "Fifth generation cellular systems support a broad range of services, including mobile broadband, critical and massive Internet of Things and are used in a variety of scenarios. In many of these scenarios, the main challenge is maintaining high throughput and ensuring proper quality of service (QoS) in irregular topologies. In multiple-input multiple-output systems, this challenge translates to designing linear transmit and receive beamformers that maximize the system throughput and manage QoS constraints. In this article, we argue that this basic design task in 5G and beyond systems must be extended such that beamforming design and user scheduling are managed jointly. Specifically, we propose a fully decentralized joint beamforming design and user scheduling algorithm that manages QoS. A novel feature of this scheme is its ability to reduce the initial rate requirements in case of infeasibility. By means of simulations that model contemporary 5G scenarios, we show that the proposed decentralized scheme outperforms benchmarking algorithms that do not support minimum rate requirements and previously proposed algorithms that support QoS requirements.",

      "abstract": "Given the ever increasing use of near field communication (NFC), the security of this system is becoming increasingly important. Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, where the physical RF characteristics of a communication device are used as a means to provide guarantees of authenticity and security, has received serious consideration due to the uniqueness of these characteristics, making cloning difficult. In this article, we discuss the feasibility of RF fingerprinting assisted by deep learning for use in identifying NFC tags. To this end, we implement a hardware testbed with an off-the-shelf NFC reader and software defined radio. An RF signal corresponding to one-bit transmission from the NFC tag is used to extract the RF characteristics, which enables rapid identification. Three different types of deep neural network are used, namely fully connected layer-based neural network\u201d convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network. By exper-iment, we confirm that deep-learning-based algorithms can uniquely distinguish 50 NFC tags with up to 96.16 percent accuracy. We also discuss some of the key technical challenges involved in the use of deep-learning-based RF fingerprinting for NFC.",

We develop DeepMDR based on ONOS, make it support protocol-oblivious forwarding (POF) in the data plane, facilitate a hierarchical CP architecture for multi-domain operations, and propose a DL model to achieve fast and high-quality path computation in each domain. Simulation results verify that our DL-assisted routing module achieves better trade-off between path computation time and routing performance than existing approaches. The effectiveness of our proposed DeepMDR is also demonstrated with experiments, which show that it serves inter-domain flow requests quickly with a processing capacity of ~166,000 messages/s or higher.",

      "abstract": "The arrival of 5G paves the way for the deployment of the so-called Industry 4.0, which is a new paradigm devoted to the digital transformation of manufacturing and factory production. Because of the resources required to perform this transformation, the importance of field trials and experimentation cannot be overstated, both to support the design of novel methodologies and to validate these designs. In this article, we leverage the 5G EVE end-to-end open platform to design and validate a novel operation approach for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This use case consists of the placement of the intelligence that controls the AGV in a remote entity. This movement could improve and simplify the operation of industrial processes. The customizability of the 5G validation platform proves fundamental to evaluate the solution under different deployment architectures and to assess its performance under hazardous radio conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability of 5G to handle latency-constrained use cases with superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art mobile technology.",

      "abstract": "Telecom companies are increasing their efforts in customer retention because acquiring new customers often costs much more than retaining existing ones. Therefore, it is important for operators to predict customer churns rapidly and accurately. Machine learning (ML) has been widely used for predictive churn modeling. However, classical ML methods require manual feature selection and time-consuming data preprocessing steps. To overcome these limitations, there is a paradigm shift toward deep learning (DL) for predicting churners. Although DL appears to be promising, the existing literature lacks comparative analysis of ML and DL techniques using benchmark churn datasets. Additionally, various DL architectures must be empirically evaluated to determine which type works best on churn data. We present a system for comparative analysis of learning architectures. Two benchmarked datasets, Cell2Cell and KDD Cup, serve as a use case of our system to provide insights on the extent of improvement DL can bring over classical ML. Four popular evaluation measures are used to compare the performance of popular DL architectures. Our experiments found that convolutional neural networks gave the best results in both use cases.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a relentless drive by all industries to digitalize many everyday operations. The maritime industry is no exception, with the increase in digital tools that assist the everyday operations of the seafarer. What is more, much of this technology is now networked together, or to the Internet, which opens the seafarer up to a wave of new cyber risks. Maritime communication systems have often been demonstrated as insecure in the recent past. Thus, without appropriate training, seafarers are ill-prepared to protect themselves, and the systems for which they are responsible, from the impacts of cyber incidents. This article argues that there is a clear link between seafarer training and maritime safety. As such, there is a need to develop standardized digital competencies for all seafarers. The creation of these competencies needs to be considerate of company-specific and operation-spe-cific risk management practices. This article presents one possible solution for the development of maritime digital competencies utilizing the well-estab-lished NIST Cybersecurity Framework.",

To realize this vision, in this article, we exploit and present the digital signal processing capabilities of chemical-reaction-based microfluid-ic circuits. To facilitate microfluidic circuit design, we describe a microfluidic circuit using a five-level architecture: molecular propagation, chemical transformation, microfluidic modules, microfluidic logic gates, and microfluidic circuits. We first identify the components at Levels 1 and 2, and present how their combinations can build the basic modules for Level 3. We then assemble basic modules to construct five types of logic gates for Level 4, including AND, NAND, OR, NOR, and XOR gates, which show advantages of microfluidic circuits in versatility and modularity. Finally, we discuss challenges and potential solutions for designing, building, and testing microfluidic circuits with complex signal processing functions in Level 5 based on the digital logic gates at Level 4.",

      "abstract": "With the new industrial revolution of digital transformation, more intelligence and autonomous systems can be adopted in the manufacturing transportation processes. Safety and security of autonomous vehicles (AVs) have obvious advantages of reducing accidents and maintaining a cautious environment for drivers and pedestrians. Therefore, the transformation to data-driven vehicles is associated with the concept of digital twin, especially within the context of AV design. This also raises the need to adopt new safety designs to increase the resiliency and security of the whole AV system. To enable secure autonomous systems for smart manufacturing transportation in an end-to-end fashion, this article presents the main challenges and solutions considering safety and security functions. This article aims to identify a standard framework for vehicular digital twins that facilitate the data collection, data processing, and analytics phases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study for a vehicle follower model is analyzed when radar sensor measurements are manipulated in an attempt to cause a collision. Perceptive findings of this article can pave the way for future research aspects related to employing digital twins in the AV industry.",

With the support of artificial intelligence, development of digital transformation through the notion of a digital twin has been taking off in many industries such as smart manufacturing, oil and gas, construction, bio-engineering, and automotive. However, digital twins remain relatively new for 5G/6G networks, despite the obvious potential in helping develop and deploy the complex 5G environment.

      "abstract": "Sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are envisioned to be empowered with novel enabling technologies to guarantee ubiquitous coverage requirements, heterogeneous communication scenarios, and improved network intelligence, spectral rates, and security. The 6G vision is not only limited to terrestrial networks, but also extends to non-terrestrial networks encompassing satellites and aerial networks, thus exploring a full spectrum of heterogeneous communication links. In 6G scenarios, the role of unmanned aerial vehicles is of paramount importance, as flying devices are expected to densely populate aerial space, providing an intermediate network layer between ground networks and space ones. As a vision of fully integrated 6G heterogeneous networks, ground, aerial, and satellite networks will coexist, thus realizing the space-air-ground integrated communication network for 6G scenarios. This work highlights several novel 6G enabling technologies, and presents the detailed study and evaluation of communication technology candidates from the perspective of aerial communication networks, key design considerations, and technical challenges.",

Besides 5G service deployment, such a service discovery architecture could provide the means for cross-service communication (CSC), that is, the consumption of a network service (NS) by another NS, empowering the service capabilities of the latter. This article presents a distributed service discovery framework for network service marketplaces (NSMs) in edge computing. We exemplify the operation of a new distributed service discovery mechanism that relies on a cache-based protocol for the discovery of NSs among edge clouds. We also present a multi-criteria ranking mechanism, which identifies the most suitable edge cloud according to the client's functional, performance, and cost requirements. Our evaluation results indicate that the proposed service discovery mechanism (SDM) yields service discovery effectiveness on par with other approaches, while drastically reducing the communication overhead.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous flight for UAVs relies on visual information for avoiding obstacles and ensuring safe collision-free flight. In addition to visual clues, safe UAVs often need connectivity with the ground station. In this article, we study the synergies between vision and communications for edge-computing-enabled UAV flight. By proposing a framework of edge computing assisted autonomous flight (ECAAF), we illustrate that vision and communications can interact with and assist each other with the aid of edge computing and offloading, and further speed up UAV mission completion. ECAAF consists of three functionalities that are discussed in detail: edge computing for 3D map acquisition, radio map construction from the 3D map, and online trajectory planning. During ECAAF, the interactions of communication capacity, video offloading, 3D map quality, and channel state of the trajectory form a positive feedback loop. Simulation results verify that the proposed method can improve mission performance by enhancing connectivity. Finally, we conclude with some future research directions.",

      "abstract": "In the 5G era, heterogeneous networks (Het-Nets) are designed for achieving data rates and customized service demands. To realize this, virtualization technologies are widely accepted as enablers for implementing 5G HetNets, aimed at managing and scheduling virtualized physical resources in a flexible manner. However, the major focus of the existing research lies in the effective allocation of virtual resources and maximizing the number of implemented network services, ignoring the virtual resource security issues. However, the security threats and vulnerabilities due to the complexity of virtualization can lead to major performance outbreaks and information leakage. Therefore, this article attempts to tackle the security issues in 5G HetNets virtual resource allocation. The article starts from modeling the major security attacks for virtual resource allocation through comprehensive discussion on the typical types of security attacks. Following the attack model, a novel secure framework (VRA-RL-SecAwa) based on the emerging reinforcement learning approach, is presented. The proposed VRA-RL-SecAwa framework works in different phases, 1. Reinforcement-learning-based preliminary security preparation 2. Greedy-approach-based secure virtual node resource allocation embedding 3. Secure and shortest path virtual link resource allocation scheme 4. Network reconfiguration and update The proposed VRA-RL-SecAwa framework is evaluated through extensive simulations in order to demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. The results obtained validate the superiority of the proposed framework in contrast to existing variants of its category.",

Despite considerable efforts via numerous grant programs, subsidies, private investments, and research initiatives, the disparity between urban and rural communities continues to widen. The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasized the importance of affordable high-speed Internet to access many social and economic opportunities including remote work, distance learning, and telemedicine. Nevertheless, with the rise of big data, it is now possible to better understand this digital divide from a data-driven perspective. In this article, we leverage a massive crowd-sourced dataset of smartphone device measurements to extract key insights regarding the current state of the digital divide in North America. Specifically, we quantify the extent of the gap, examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore possible socioeconomic factors that may be influential in operator business models. Finally, we demonstrate how crowdsourced datasets can be leveraged to monitor the impact of emerging technologies, to better direct federal broadband funds, and to make more informed spectrum policy decisions.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses an Ultra-Reliable Low-La-tency Communication (URLLC) implementation on a 5G New Radio (NR) virtual radio access Network (vRAN). The vRAN application runs on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) test platform, on which 3GPP 5G NR RAN Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) containerized network functions (CNFs) are implemented. To demonstrate capability and scalability, the CNFs are dimensioned to support up to three 100 MHz cells. URLLC and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slices are implemented to partition L1 processing for mixed use cases. This article illustrates an advantage of virtualization in managing L1 processing demand by L1 slice-scaling. It also describes a methodology for optimal cell capacity dimensioning based on connected URLLC users' service level agreements (SLAs) in terms of latency, reliability, and throughput. Using analysis of the test results, the article discusses maintaining a critical time budget of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) L1 processing pipelines and points out techniques to increase L1 processing capacity to achieve URLLC SLA while serving eMBB users. The article concludes that a 5G NR vRAN application running on COTS hardware enables public/private URLLC verticals including mobile edge computing, cloud gaming, AR/VR, industrial automation, and others.",

In this article, we propose end-to-end and ubiquitous secure machine learning (ML)-powered intent-based networking (IBN). The IBN framework is aware of its state and context to autonomously take proactive actions for service assurance. It is integrated in a zero-touch control and orchestration framework featuring an ML function orchestrator to manage ML pipelines. The objective is to create an elastic and dynamic infrastructure supporting per-domain and end-to-end network and services operation. The solution is supported by a radio access network and forwarding plane, and a cloud/edge virtualization infrastructure with ML acceleration. The resulting framework supports application-level resilience and intelligence through replication and elasticity. An illustrative intelligent application use case is presented.",

With the widespread Internet of Things (IoT) devices in such networks, powering and exploring energy to operate them is vital in the 5G era. Therefore, projecting and forecasting how to power IoT devices in the 5G network have already begun, with an aspiration to provide self-powered and green future communication services. Here, we provide a vision for energy harvesting technologies for IoT devices (e.g., emerging wearable and implantable devices employed in healthcare and consumer technologies) that can aid the research line in the 5G era. We propose that various power harvesting and management techniques at the circuit, device, and system levels will be the most crucial segment of IoT devices. Thus, self-power and sustainability should be key features of IoT devices in the 5G network, and ought to be given close attention by electronics and communications communities. To envision this concept, we provide a systematic outline in which prospective power harvesting scenarios of IoT devices in the 5G network are expected. We successively describe vital potential landscapes of 5G and evaluate the energy harvesting and power management requirements. We additionally investigate the challenges beyond energy technologies that could impede the 5G enhancement.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, radio frequency (RF) sensing has gained increasing popularity due to its pervasiveness, low cost, non-intrusiveness, and privacy preservation. However, realizing the promises of RF sensing is highly nontrivial, given typical challenges such as multipath and interference. One potential solution leverages deep learning to build direct mappings from the RF domain to target domains, hence avoiding complex RF physical modeling. While earlier solutions exploit only simple feature extraction and classification modules, an emerging trend adds functional layers on top of elementary modules for more powerful generalizability and flexible applicability. To better understand this potential, this article takes a layered approach to summarize RF sensing enabled by deep learning. Essentially, we present a four-layer framework: physical, backbone, generalization, and application. While this layered framework provides readers a systematic methodology for designing deep interpreted RF sensing, it also facilitates making improvement proposals and hints at future research opportunities.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we present a client-based multipath TCP (cMPTCP) framework that can cope with path heterogeneity across multiple LTE networks deployed by different operators. cMPTCP is the first work to apply the mobile client's inference based on our observation that an out-of-order queue in an MPTCP receiver (i.e., mobile client) builds up with increasing heterogeneity between different subflows and can significantly degrade throughput performance compared to that achieved by single-path TCP via the best path. For agile and accurate control for the existing MPTCP architecture, we argue that mobile clients are the best network entities to infer the bottleneck state of an end-to-end MPTCP connection. Our proposed cMPTCP consists of two main components: client-initiated multipath selection and subflow-level rate control mechanisms. These mechanisms are compatible with the default MPTCP architecture implemented in the Linux kernel. For performance evaluation, we prototype a complete LTE network testbed consisting of mobile phones, LTE base stations, LTE cores, and application servers. Our experimental results confirm that cMPTCP outperforms existing server-side schedulers in practical dynamic channel conditions.",

      "abstract": "Despite global connectivity being one of the main requirements for future generations of wireless networks driven by the United Nation&amp;#x0027;s Sustainable Development Goals, telecom providers are economically discouraged from investing in sparsely populated areas, such as rural and remote ones. Novel affordable and sustainable paradigms are thus indispensable to enhance the cellular infrastructure in such areas and bridge the digital divide when compared with urban ones. We investigate the use of wind-turbine-mounted base stations (WTBSs) as a cost-effective solution for regions with high wind energy potential, since it could replace or even outperform current solutions requiring additional cell towers (CTs), satellites, or aerial BSs. Indeed, conveniently installing BS equipment on wind generators would allow the transceivers to reach sufficient altitudes and easily establish line-of-sight channels within large areas. We also propose insightful simulation results for realistic case studies based on datasets for wind speed and population densities as well as wind turbines&amp;#x0027; and CTs&amp;#x0027; locations within specific Argentinian and Ethiopian exurban regions. By doing this, we hope to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this solution and stimulate its implementation.",

The potential of EVs for diagnostic and therapeutic applications has recently received significant attention. To enhance the potential of EVs for more extensive functionalities, here we motivate the concept of engineered EV-mediat-ed communication nanonetworks. Corresponding with the EV-mediated intercellular signaling network components that naturally extend the limited ability of individual cells to perform the intricate vital functions, we propose a fundamental molecular communication network framework and review the potential experimental techniques to obtain data for its validation. The proposed framework paves the way for the development of engineered EV-mediated communication networks and enables novel approaches, perspectives, tools, and metrics to reveal the principles and emergent properties of biological EV-mediat-ed signaling networks the understanding of which is still obscure.",

Immersive services immerse a viewer or the viewed digital objects into an environment that is either real, virtual, or a mixture of both. The applications are accordingly named virtual reality, augmented reality, extended reality, and holography applications. These applications benefit from the ongoing advances in user interfaces, computing technologies, and networking technologies. Such applications are expected to generate most of the traffic in the next generation networks, particularly 6G networks. In this article, the main relevant use cases are introduced along with their respective requirements. The article also provides insights on the relevant architectures and solutions, and highlights some research challenges and directions.",

      "abstract": "Under the federated learning paradigm, a set of nodes can cooperatively train a machine learning model with the help of a centralized server. Such a server is also tasked with assigning a weight to the information received from each node, and often also to drop too-slow nodes from the learning process. Both decisions have major impact on the resulting learning performance, and can interfere with each other in counter-in-tuitive ways. In this article, we focus on edge networking scenarios and investigate existing and novel approaches to such model-weighting and node-dropping decisions. Leveraging a set of realworld experiments, we find that popular, straightforward decision making approaches may yield poor performance, and that considering the quality of data in addition to its quantity can substantially improve learning.",

      "abstract": "Model-free techniques, such as machine learning (ML), have recently attracted much interest toward the physical layer design (e.g., symbol detection, channel estimation, and beamforming). Most of these ML techniques employ centralized learning (CLK) schemes and assume the availability of datasets at a parameter server (PS), demanding the transmission of data from edge devices, such as mobile phones, to the PS. Exploiting the data generated at the edge, federated learning (FL) has been proposed recently as a distributed learning scheme, in which each device computes the model parameters and sends them to the PS for model aggregation, while the datasets are kept intact at the edge. Thus, FL is more communication-efficient and privacy-preserving than CL and applicable to the wireless communication scenarios, wherein the data are generated at the edge devices. This article presents the recent advances in FL-based training for physical layer design problems. Compared to CL, the effectiveness of FL is presented in terms of communication overhead with a slight performance loss in the learning accuracy. The design challenges, such as model, data, and hardware complexity, are also discussed in detail along with possible solutions.",

      "abstract": "Today's age of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in urban areas revolves around the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) and application of IoT in smart city constructs. IoT has enabled cheap but reliable ubiquitous computing for modern day ICT needs. As a result, the military community is actively looking into application of IoT for its operational needs. Federation and interoperability become complex for IoT implementation in the huge jungle of protocols and technologies available for IoT. This problem becomes critical in humanitarian assistance and disaster recovery operations where multiple agencies need to collaborate to bring quick and effective relief to disaster struck areas. Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is such an IoT-based protocol that is widely adopted in the industry for lightweight but reliable messaging. This article tries to provide insight into federation based on MQTT with a prototype implementation between military and civilian ICT systems. This federation concept would enable lightweight, vendor-agnostic, and interoperable message exchange while using existing information sources and preventing stove-piped systems.",

      "abstract": "Industry 4.0 proposes the use of 5G networks to support intra-factory communications in replacement of current communication practices. 5G networks offer high availability, ultra-low latency, and high bandwidth, and allow the allocation of computational resources closer to the factories for reducing latency and response time. In addition, artificial intelligence can help in making smart decisions to improve the industrial and logistic processes. This work presents an interesting use case that combines Industry 4.0, 5G networks, and deep learning techniques for predicting the malfunctioning of an automatic guided vehicle (AGV) by exclusively using network traffic information and without needing to deploy any meter in the end-us-er equipment AGV and programmable logic controller (PLC). The AGV is connected through a 5G access to its PLC, which is deployed and virtualized in a multi-access edge computing infrastructure. A complete set of intensive experiments with a real 5G network and an industrial AGV were carried out in the 5TONIC environment, validating the effectiveness of this solution.",

      "abstract": "Existing communication systems are mainly built based on Shannon's information theory, which deliberately ignores the semantic aspects of communication. The recent iteration of wireless technology, 5G and beyond, promises to support a plethora of services enabled by carefully tailored network capabilities based on contents, requirements, as well as semantics. This has sparked significant interest in semantic communication, a novel paradigm that involves the meaning of messages in communication. In this article, we first review classic semantic communication frameworks and then summarize key challenges that hinder its popularity. We observe that some semantic communication processes such as semantic detection, knowledge modeling, and coordination can be resource-consuming and inefficient, especially for communication between a single source and a destination. We therefore propose a novel architecture based on federated edge intelligence for supporting resource-efficient semantic-aware networking. Our architecture allows each user to offload computationally intensive semantic encoding and decoding tasks to edge servers and protect its proprietary model-re-lated information by coordinating via intermediate results. Our simulation result shows that the proposed architecture can reduce resource consumption and significantly improve communication efficiency.",

This is particularly concerning in the military domain, where frequencies are contested for by both CIS and EW systems. The success of NATO activities necessitates mission-critical communications with increasing throughput, hidden from enemy signals intelligence, robust against electronic attacks, and compatible with host EW tasks. In response, the NATO STO IST-175 research task group is working on the disruptive concept of FD radio technology to address those challenges. Military FD radios promise to increase the spectral efficiency and robustness of CIS and improve the performance of EW tasks through simultaneous operation and multifunctionality.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency (EE) has been regarded as an essential design metric in 5G mobile communications. However, the massive antenna numbers, larger bandwidths, and higher density of base stations have been severely deteriorating the power consumption of 5G networks. In this article, the fundamental EE-spectrum efficiency (SE) joint design issues are thoughtfully considered. The relationships between EE and SE in single-input single-output (SISO), multiple-input multiple-output, and hybrid beamforming structures are first reviewed, where the increase of SE (EE) will unfortunately bring a reduction of EE (SE). To resolve this contradiction, a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme with energy-efficient user scheduling and resource allocation is investigated, which promises a simultaneous increase of EE and SE. Furthermore, a precoded waveform overlapping multiplexing scheme is presented, with significant improvements in EE and SE over the traditional Nyquist-criterion-based SISO systems. The waveform overlapping multiple access scheme is further proposed, which promises large performance improvements over the NOMA schemes discussed in 5G New Radio. The application of the waveform overlapping scheme in multiple-antenna systems is also investigated. Finally, the challenges of the waveform overlapping scheme and several other research topics are discussed. For sustainable development of the wireless communications industry, greener design in physical layer technologies should be second to none in the future 6G networks and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Most softwarized telco services are conveniently framed as service function chains (SFCs). Indeed, being structured as a combination of interconnected nodes, service chains may suffer from the single point of failure problem, meaning that an individual node malfunctioning could compromise the whole chain operation. To guarantee highly available (HA) levels, service providers are required to introduce redundancy strategies to achieve specific availability demands, where cost constraints have to be taken into account as well. Along these lines we propose HASFC, a framework designed to support, through a dedicated REST interface, the MANO infrastructure in deploying SFCs with an optimal availability/cost trade-off. Our framework is equipped with: an availability model builder aimed to construct probabilistic models of the SFC nodes in terms of failure/repair actions; and a chaining and selection module to compose the possible redundant SFCs, and extract the best candidates thereof. Beyond providing architectural details, we demonstrate the functionalities of HASFC through a use case that considers the IP Multimedia Subsystem, an SFC-like structure adopted to manage multimedia contents within 4G/5G networks.",

      "abstract": "The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) can potentially reduce a network's deployment cost and energy consumption. However, a connection between a centralized baseband unit and distributed remote radio heads, known as a fronthaul, introduces an additional delay to both control and user planes. This delay is a serious limiting factor for radio resource management functionalities, such as scheduling, because the radio resources are assigned to users according to outdated channel quality information if the fronthaul delay is non-zero. This article provides an overview of existing scheduling approaches suitable for C-RAN and identifies their potential limitations. Based on these limitations, we outline a framework for hierarchical scheduling. The hierarchical scheduling mitigates a negative impact of the fronthaul delay on the throughput of non-cell-edge users and enables efficient retransmission of erroneous data. Besides, cell-edge users can still benefit from interference mitigation techniques requiring centralized control. We compare individual scheduling approaches and show that hierarchical scheduling increases the network throughput (by up to 26 percent) and reduces the number of retransmissions with respect to the existing solutions.",

While terrestrial and satellite technologies are well established for providing connectivity services, they face certain shortcomings and challenges, which could be addressed by complementing them with HAPS systems. In this article, we envision a HAPS as a super macro base station, to which we refer as HAPS-SMBS, to provide connectivity in a plethora of applications. Unlike a conventional HAPS, which targets broad coverage for remote areas or disaster recovery, we envision next-generation HAPS-SMBS to have the necessary capabilities to address the high capacity, low latency, and computing requirements, especially for highly populated metropolitan areas.

      "abstract": "High-altitude platform station (HAPS) as International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) base station (HIBS) has been attracting the attention of aerospace and telecommunication companies from many countries in recent years. The HIBS&amp;#x0027; remarkable differential feature is the possibility of using HAPS to complement the IMT terrestrial coverage, benefiting from the platforms being located in the stratosphere, enabling much wider coverage when compared to conventional terrestrial solutions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the technological and social differences among countries, mainly due to the poor quality, or even absence, of Internet connectivity. HIBSs might efficiently support reducing the digital divide, since they provide connectivity to the same mobile devices as the terrestrial networks, which allows this non-terrestrial connectivity solution to increase global coverage and expand mobile connectivity for everyone. This article describes the fundamentals of the HIBS, as well as its deployment scenarios and regulatory aspects. Furthermore, it is reported, for the first time in the literature, a coexistence analysis between HIBS and fixed services point-to-point (FS-PP), as an International Telecommunication Union - Radio-communication Sector preparatory study for the support of decisions to be made at the 2023 World Radiocommunication Conference. The simulations demonstrate the feasibility of coexistence between HIBS and FS-PP active links, sharing the HIBS Band 2 around 2 GHz.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can support huge data rate growth and wide bandwidth in the new 5G era, and a hybrid precoding architecture can effectively handle the high hardware cost and energy consumption problems. A crucial goal is to optimize the system's spectral efficiency (SE) by effectively designing the digital precoder and the analog precoder. In this article, we review the conventional hybrid precoding schemes in mmWave systems, and then investigate several novel systems with index modulation (IM) techniques as well as their hybrid precoder designs. With the advantages of IM, higher SE can be achieved with limited radio frequency chains in mmWave systems. Simulation results demonstrate that two types of IM-aided systems both outperform conventional mmWave systems, which proves that IM is an enabling technique in practical SE-driven mmWave systems. Finally, we discuss the limiting factors and outlook of IM-aided mmWave systems in beyond-5G wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "In smart electricity grids, high time granularity (HTG) power consumption data can be decomposed into individual appliance load signatures via nonintrusive appliance load monitoring techniques to expose appliance usage profiles. Various methods ranging from load shaping to noise addition and data aggregation have been proposed to mitigate this problem. However, with the growing scarcity of natural resources, utilities other than electricity (e.g., water and natural gas) have also begun to be subject to HTG metering, which creates privacy issues similar to that of electricity. Therefore, employing privacy protection countermeasures for only electricity usage is ineffective for appliances that utilize additional/other metered resources. As such, existing privacy countermeasures and metrics need to be reevaluated to address not only electricity, but also any other resource that is metered. Furthermore, a holistic privacy protection approach for all metered resources must be adopted as the information leak from any of the resources has the potential to render the privacy preserving countermeasures for all the other resources futile. This article introduces the privacy preservation problem for multiple HTG metered resources and explores potential solutions for its mitigation.",

This is of particular interest when using large antennas at high frequency (e.g., at millimeter-wave or terahertz), whose operating condition may easily fall in the Fresnel region (radiating near-field), where the classical plane wave propagation assumption is no longer valid. This article analyzes the optimal communication involving large intelligent surfaces realized, for example, with metamaterials as possible enabling technology for holographic communication. It is shown that traditional propagation models must be revised and that, when exploiting spherical wave propagation in the near-field region, new opportunities are opened, for example, in terms of feasible orthogonal communication channels.",

      "abstract": "Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are becoming increasingly feasible, and these vehicles are expected to enhance road safety, traffic throughput, energy efficiency, and human comfort, especially at road intersections and for lane changing, merging, and unprotected turning maneuvers. However, there is likely to be a long transition period before human-driven vehicles are completely replaced by such automated vehicles. To leverage the autonomous driving technologies on public roads, we have to design and develop safe interaction and cooperation for mixed traffic environments, where human-driven and autonomous vehicles cooperate with one another in order to avoid vehicle collisions and possible deadlocks. In this article, we study the requirements and challenges for such safe cooperation of autonomous vehicles and human drivers, and review three prospective components: road infrastructure, vehicular communications, and online recognition and prediction. First, road infrastructure contributes to improving CAV capabilities for safe cooperation as a centralized coordinator. In addition, vehicle-to-vehicle communications might be key to safe cooperation in a decentralized manner that can guarantee road safety for multiple connected vehicles. Online motion prediction and real-time gesture recognition are also essential to develop a safe cooperation system in a decentralized manner with non-connected vehicles. These three approaches are not exclusive, and CAVs may complementarily use them in practice. Finally, we discuss the feasibility and limitations of each approach and conclude with future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Due to rapidly growing cloud-based applications and services, data center networks handle huge traffic and they started receiving significant attention recently. In this article, we first review various trends in data center network architectures. Then we propose a novel hyperscale architecture named Transparent HyperX (TH) and compare it to existing real-world architectures. The TH concept is inspired by the conventional HyperX topology, but designed with a number of additional all-optical diagonal links that maintain pod-to-pod path cost below two hops and ensure more transparent connectivity between pods throughout the entire data center. This reduction in path cost not only results in lower latency, but also saves on the number of switches and transponders, which eventually reduces the power consumption. This architecture also offers high scalability and supports over 1 million servers using 100 radix switches.",

We then provide an updated digest of 802.11be essential features, vouching for multi-AP coordination as a must-have for critical and latency-sensitive applications.

In this article, we propose improvements to contention-based networks that utilize inter-robot navigation information for safer robot motion control in dense multi-robot settings. Toward this end, we introduce a Crash Risk Prioritization (CRP) index, which is employed as the core metric in a scheme of dynamic beacon rate control. Key to our approach is a coupled evaluation setup that allows us to evaluate the impact of network-level changes on the safety of robot navigation. Our results demonstrate that the co-design and simulation of robotic control algorithms and network protocols provide key insights and metrics into the network-level requirements for V2V systems. These insights allow us to make informed conclusions about how such networks can be best served by emerging standards.",

This severely penalizes their ability to meet critical requirements of emerging wireless applications, due to the inefficiency with which these algorithms learn from their interactions with the environment. In this article, we describe how data-driven RL algorithms can be improved by systematically integrating basic system models into the learning process. Our proposed approach uses real-time data in conjunction with knowledge about the underlying communication system to achieve orders of magnitude improvement in key performance metrics, such as convergence speed and compute/memory complexity, relative to well-established RL benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) has recently attracted keen interest from regulatory bodies around the world as a key strategy to overcome spectrum scarcity in beyond 5G networks. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has adopted a three-tier DSS model for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band managed by a spectrum access system (SAS) to share incumbents' spectrum with commercial cellular broadband applications. In this article, we first present a survey of current DSS approaches and their limitations and then discuss the benefits of using in-band full-duplex (IBFD) techniques in DSS networks. To illustrate the improvement in the performance of priority access license (PAL) and general authorized access (GAA) users in an IBFD-assisted CBRS, we consider a CBRS mobile broadband network (MBN) architecture comprising an incumbent in the form of a MIMO radar system and an IBFD MIMO MBN, consisting of PAL and GAA users. In particular, we design joint beamformers at the MBN, with constraints on transmit power at the MBN and detection probability of the radar system, and beamformers at the radar system to mitigate the interference from the radar system toward the cellular system. It is shown that the IBFD CBRS network architecture not only leads to improved performance of PAL and GAA users, but does so while producing less interference toward the radar than state-of-the-art half-duplex solutions. Finally, we present some open research challenges to invigorate research on beyond 5G IBFD DSS networks.",

      "abstract": "Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that support smart city development. An individual application inherits distinct features that demand different characteristics of LPWANs. For instance, various applications demand different data rates or tolerate different packet drop rates. As such, quantified performance of the LPWAN will help developers to make decisions on classes and types of LPWAN to be used. Previous works only provided qualitative comparisons on LPWANs. Thus, smart application developers are still facing the challenge of inappropriately adopting LPWAN technologies. Currently, the IEEE Standard Working Group P2668 is working on developing a standard to evaluate, grade, and rank the performance of IoT objects by using indicator values referred to as IoT Index (IDex). To achieve smart selection on LPWANs, the IEEE P2668 IDex Working Group has first focused on the evaluation of LPWANs and developed a novel LPWAN-I. The proposed LPWAN-I is a sub-index of the IDex that quantitatively evaluates the applicability of LPWANs and selects the most suitable LPWAN candidate for a specific application. This work is the first article to report IDex, which helps to deliver the best practice. Finally, the challenges and future development of LPWAN-I are also presented.",

In this tutorial, aerosol and droplet transmission is modeled as a multiuser scenario with mobile nodes, related to broadcasting and relaying. In contrast to data communication systems, in the application of pathogen-laden aerosol transmission, mutual information between nodes should be minimized. Toward this goal, several countermeasures are reasoned. The findings are supported by experimental results and by an advanced particle simulation tool. This work is inspired by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, but also applicable to other airborne infectious diseases like influenza.",

      "abstract": "Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is an important new feature in 5G NR that enables rapid and cost-effective millimeter-wave (mmWave) deployments through self-backhauling in the same spectrum. IAB deployments can achieve excellent cell edge coverage, for example, uplink rates above 100 Mb/s, while significantly reducing the amount of required fiber. This article provides a primer on IAB, contrasting it with the many failed multihop systems that preceded it. We conduct a large-scale study of coverage and rate performance based on a plausible deployment in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood, utilizing ray tracing in the 39 GHz band. The study demonstrates that, as theory predicts, an IAB solution provides a massive coverage advantage for early mmWave rollouts with only a small number of fiber-connected (donor) base stations, for example, less than 10/km<sup>2</sup>. We show that as the UE and traffic loads increase over time as the 5G eco-system matures, the per user throughput can be maintained by replacing IAB (relay) nodes with donor nodes, that is, slowly extending the fiber network.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have proposed solutions to limit the spreading of the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. Systems capable of guaranteeing compliance with the minimum distance between people have been considered important to prevent the diffusion of the virus. In this article, we describe one system that can be used to keep distancing among persons moving in public spaces. It is based on the integration of computer vision techniques for rapidly detecting the presence of gatherings in the area and local radio technologies to identify and alert persons in the detected gatherings. We show that the goal of distancing can be achieved by fully respecting the privacy of individuals, which could be compromised by other distancing solutions such as those based on apps installed on personal devices such as smartphones and tablets.",

      "abstract": "Next generation (NextG) cellular networks will be natively cloud-based and built on programmable, virtualized, and disaggregated architectures. The separation of control functions from the hardware fabric and the introduction of standardized control interfaces will enable the definition of custom closed-control loops, which will ultimately enable embedded intelligence and real-time analytics, thus effectively realizing the vision of autonomous and self-optimizing networks. This article explores the disaggregated network architecture proposed by the O-RAN Alliance as a key enabler of NextG networks. Within this architectural context, we discuss the potential, the challenges, and the limitations of data-driven optimization approaches to network control over different timescales. We also present the first large-scale integration of O-RAN-compliant software components with an open source full-stack softwarized cellular network. Experiments conducted on Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator, demonstrate closed-loop integration of real-time analytics and control through deep reinforcement learning agents. We also show the feasibility of radio access network (RAN) control through xApps running on the near-real-time RAN intelligent controller to optimize the scheduling policies of coexisting network slices, leveraging the O-RAN open interfaces to collect data at the edge of the network.",

      "abstract": "In the presence of global pandemics, the increasing demands of remote healthcare, online education, and automation systems have driven the development of the Tactile Internet (TI), which aims to support timely and reliable interactions among humans and machines. Since ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) have been considered in the fifth generation (5G) standards, the state-of-the-art 5G mobile networks are well aligned with the TI. Nevertheless, TI applications in different vertical industries have unique requirements on top of URLLC, such as global connectivity, high mobility, and low jitter. Since these issues have not been addressed in URLLC, 5G is not ready for the full vision of the TI. Motivated by this fact, we identify promising technologies to fulfill these requirements and summarize corresponding new research challenges in the sixth generation mobile networks. To handle these new challenges, we put forward an intelligent communication framework. Specifically, machine learning is applied in prediction and decision making, where the impacts of prediction errors on the reliability of the TI are considered. In this case study, we illustrate how to implement the framework in a typical TI application. Our results show that the proposed framework has the potential to achieve zero latency and can improve the trade-offs among latency, reliability, and resource utilization efficiency remarkably compared to existing benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Free-space optical (FSO) systems are able to offer the high data-rate, secure, and cost-efficient communication links required for applications such as wireless front- and backhauling for 5G and 6G communication networks. Despite the substantial advancement of FSO systems over the past decades, the requirement of a line-of-sight connection between transmitter and receiver remains a key limiting factor for their deployment. In this article, we discuss the potential role of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as a solution to relax this requirement. We present an overview of existing optical IRS technologies; compare optical IRSs with radio frequency IRSs and optical relays; and identify various open problems for future research on IRS-assisted FSO communications.",

In such IoT environments, machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is key for allowing these devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, smart meters/monitors) to collect data toward a remote server. We address this particular scenario by building and evaluating an IoT multi-access reference architecture, with a multipath TCP (MPTCP) gateway connected to multiple cellular networks to offload M2M data traffic. Experimental results from CoAP-emulated traffic indicate that the our proposed system together with the benefits of MPTCP improve IoT application performance. More specifically, multipath-based M2M data traffic offloading increases throughput and significantly reduces latency of CoAP requests as the number of sensor networks increases.",

      "abstract": "Contact tracing promises to help fight the spread of COVID-19 via an early detection of possible contagion events. To this end, most existing solutions share the following architecture: smartphones continuously broadcast random beacons that are intercepted by nearby devices and stored into their local contact logs. In this article, we propose an IoT-enabled architecture for contact tracing that relaxes the smartphone-centric assumption, and provides a solution that enjoys the following features: it reduces the overhead on the end user to the bare minimum - the mobile device only broadcasts its beacons; it provides the user with a degree of privacy not achieved by competing solutions - even in the most privacy adverse scenario, the solution provides k-anonymity; and it is flexible: the same architecture can be configured to support several models - ranging from fully decentralized to fully centralized ones - and the system parameters can be tuned to support the tracing of several social interaction models. What is more, our proposal can also be adopted to tackle future human-proximity transmissible diseases. Finally, we also highlight open issues and discuss a number of future research directions at the intersection of IoT and contact tracing.",

      "abstract": "Interest flooding attacks (IFAs) are widely regarded as being among the most harmful security risks in named data networking (NDN). Through an IFA, the attacker injects numerous Interest packets into a network to drain network resources such as bandwidth, caching capacity, and computational capacity, which can seriously affect the normal data content requests of legitimate consumers and degrade the network quality of service (QoS). To design a high-efficiency IFA mitigation scheme, it is critical to detect attacks accurately and rapidly. Therefore, there is high interest in developing an optimized attack detection scheme. In this study, the concept of an isolation forest (iForest) is introduced to develop an IFA detection mechanism in which the iForest construction process isolates abnormal and legitimate prefixes. This approach enables malicious prefixes to be identified among abnormal prefixes to mitigate IFAs by restricting the forwarding of malicious Interest packets. The results of extensive simulations show that the proposed iForest-based IFA detection mechanism (IFDM) outperforms other related schemes in terms of attack detection accuracy and speed and thus can offer effective support for preserving NDN QoS.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communication with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has appeared as a promising technique for many application scenarios in future communication networks. In this article, we provide a vision of four UAV-enabled aerial computing (AC) architectures. Specifically, these architectures have attracted growing attention in recent years for decreasing data processing delay and enhancing computation performance via integrating UAVs into AC systems. We first study the benefits and application scenarios of UAV-enabled AC networks. Then we emphasize the efficient computation and communication design of UAV-enabled AC networks by discussing the potential research issues and key design considerations in a comprehensive manner. In addition, extensive case study simulations show the performance superiority of UAV-enabled AC networks over conventional infrastructure-based mobile edge computing networks. To provide an instructive guide for future research work, we discuss the technical challenges and open issues.",

However, conventional terrestrial cellular networks have unfortunately neglected the huge geographical digital divide, &lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;ince high-bandwidth wireless coverage is concentrated in urban areas. To meet the goal of &amp;#x201C;connecting the unconnected,&amp;#x201D; integrating low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with the terrestrial cellular networks has been widely considered as a promising solution. In this article, we first introduce the development roadmap of LEO &lt;sup&gt;sa&lt;/sup&gt;tellite constellations (SatCons), including early attempts in LEO satellites with the emerging LEO constellations. Further, we discuss the unique opportunities of employing LEO SatCons for the delivery of integrating 5G networks. Specifically, we present their key performance indicators, which offer important guidelines for the design of associated enabling techniques, and then discuss the potential impact of integrating LEO SatCons with typical 5G use cases, where we engrave our vision of various vertical domains reshaped by LEO SatCons. Technical challenges are finally provided to specify future research directions.",

At its core is a fast frequency hopping technique designed to offer higher network capacity while offering the same radio link budget as LoRa. Additionally, LR-FHSS finely manages packet transmission thanks to its design principles, enabling QoS policies on a per-packet basis. Given the notorious adoption of LoRaWAN in the IoT application landscape, this article is a reference for understanding how exactly LR-FHSS works, the performance it can offer, and its limitations and research opportunities.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of drones has increased their deployment in a wide range of applications like commercial delivery, industrial systems, monitoring, surveillance, and surveys. The facility of fast deployment and cost effectiveness make drones a potential choice for an aerial base station to serve user equipments (UEs) in a defined area. Drones are equipped with night vision cameras, advanced sensors, and GPS receivers, which make them able to capture data and either analyze it to discover new patterns or transmit it to the remote cloud for storage and processing. Furthermore, the drones data relaying system helps to extend the service coverage area to provide reliable communication connection to isolated UEs. However, the deployment of drones at remote locations relies only on GPS, and these systems are prone to various attacks that can lead to signal blockage. Data integrity and privacy are important issues that must be addressed before the deployment of drones in commercial sectors. Therefore, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based security approach for drone-to-everything communications wherein the location of drones is tracked based on the segment division of area under deployment. Moreover, we design a miner node selection algorithm that uses computational resources, battery status, and time of flight of a drone as parameters to select the miner node. The security evaluation of the proposed framework clearly shows the viability of blockchain in drone deployments across remote sites.",

As next-generation networks will introduce hyper-connectivity with emerging applications, this impact will undoubtedly further increase, proliferating the importance of location information's reliability. As society becomes more dependent on this information in terms of products and services, security solutions will have to be enriched to provide countermeasures sufficiently advanced to ever-evolving threats, forcing the joint design of communication and localization systems. This article envisions integrated communication and localization systems by focusing on localization security. Also, conventional and next-generation attacks on localization are discussed along with an efficient attack detection method and a testbed-based demonstration, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "As the pace of global 5G network deployments accelerates, now is the moment for the cellular industry to realize 6G cellular communication. In this article, modular massive multiple-in-put multiple-output (mmMIMO) is presented as one candidate technology for 6G to improve the spectral efficiency in low-frequency bands. The 5G New Radio pushed the boundary of the cellular system&amp;#x0027;s operating frequency to high-frequen-cy bands, and this trend will continue in the 6G era. However, the technical advances in 5G for low-frequency bands fall short, although low-frequency bands are crucial in serving a large number of users in a wide coverage area. Although it would be ideal if massive MIMO could be utilized in low-frequency bands, it is less practical due to a large antenna form factor size. mmMIMO is a technology to distribute a large active antenna array with smaller standardized antenna modules, just like Lego-type building blocks. Through this, the benefits of massive MIMO can be achieved in low-frequency bands (e.g., sub-1 GHz), unconstrained by spatial limitations. In this article, the concept of mmMIMO, its applicability, and needed research efforts to standardize the technology for 6G are discussed. In addition, through the demonstration of a proof-of-concept system, it is shown that the technology can be within reach at the time of 6G commercialization around 2030. Lastly, the performance gain of mmMIMO is evidenced by system-level simulation.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Bio-nano Things is a significant development for next generation communication technologies. Because conventional wireless communication technologies face challenges in realizing new applications (e.g., in-body area networks for health monitoring) and necessitate the substitution of information carriers, researchers have shifted their interest to molecular communications (MC). Although remarkable progress has been made in this field over the last decade, advances have been far from acceptable for the achievement of its application objectives. A crucial problem of MC is the low data rate and high error rate inherent in particle dynamics specifications, in contrast to wave-based conventional communications. Therefore, it is important to investigate the resources by which MC can obtain additional information paths and provide strategies to exploit these resources. This study aims to examine techniques involving resource aggregation and exploitation to provide prospective directions for future progress in MC. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art studies on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We discuss the possible advantages of applying MIMO to various MC system models. Furthermore, we survey various studies that aimed to achieve MIMO gains for the respective models, from theoretical background to prototypes. Finally, we conclude this study by summarizing the challenges that need to be addressed.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces the application of machine learning (ML)-based procedures in real-world satellite communication operations. While the application of ML in image processing has led to unprecedented advantages in new services and products, the application of ML in wireless systems is still in its infancy. In particular, this article focuses on the introduction of ML-based mechanisms in satellite network operation centers such as interference detection, flexible payload configuration, and congestion prediction. Three different use cases are described, and the proposed ML models are introduced. All the models have been constructed using real data and considering current operations. As reported in the numerical results, the proposed ML-based techniques show good numerical performance: the interference detector presents a false detection probability decrease of 44 percent, the flexible payload optimizer reduces the unmet capacity by 32 percent, and the traffic predictor reduces the prediction error by 10 percent compared to other approaches. In light of these results, the proposed techniques are useful in the process of automating satellite communication systems.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the development of marine industries has increasingly attracted attention from all over the world. A wide-area and seamless maritime communication network has become a critical supporting approach. In this article, we propose a novel architecture named the maritime giant cellular network (MagicNet) relying on seaborne floating towers deployed in a honeycomb topology. The tower-borne giant-cell base stations are capable of providing wide-area seamless coverage for maritime users and can construct multihop line-of-sight (LoS) links connecting to terrestrial networks. Then the MagicNet-aided maritime network architecture is expounded in terms of five dimensions (i.e., space, air, shore, surface, and underwater), which is compatible with existing systems including maritime satellite networks and maritime Internet of Things, and supports a range of compelling industrial applications. Moreover, we introduce a joint multicast beamforming and relay system for the sake of supporting high-speed and low-cost information services for near-shore areas, as well as a three-tier space-air-surface hybrid network in order to provide reliable wide-area communications for deep offshore areas. Finally, we discuss the open issues and future works on MagicNet.",

      "abstract": "With the popularization of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the home environment, security incidents have become more recurrent with end users. Knowledge sharing on incident mitigation with intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) can improve domestic IoT security, but both signa-ture-based and anomaly-based approaches pose challenges of updating, portability, and privacy. Our previous work extended the RFC 8520 functions and proposed the Intra-Network eXposure analyzer Utility (INXU) as a signature-based IPS to address these challenges. The INXU's architecture solves the signature update problem, and its Malicious Traffic Description (MTD) data model solves the portability and privacy issues. However, the referred MTD data model is prone to high false-positive detection rates due to the lack of contextual information for identifying effective threats. Thus, this work proposes an improvement to the MTD data model that reduces the false-positive detection rates. The concepts from an IoT security ontology are incorporated into the MTD data model to insert contextual information for the decision making process. With this, the present work proposes the improved MTD as a standard data model for sharing knowledge about the mitigation of malicious activities through IoT systems. Experiments using a Mirai botnet variant shows the improved performance provided by the solution herein proposed. The infections are reduced by up to 63 percent when compared to RFC 8520, and the false-positive detection is reduced by approximately 27 percent when compared with the original MTD.",

      "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for enabling cellu-lar-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in the future. Equipped with full-dimensional large arrays, ground base stations (GBSs) can apply adaptive fine-grained 3D beamforming to mitigate the strong interference between high-altitude UAVs and low-altitude terrestrial users, thus significantly enhancing the network spectral efficiency. However, the performance gain of massive MIMO critically depends on accurate channel state information of both UAVs and terrestrial users at the GBSs, which is practically difficult to achieve due to UAV-in-duced pilot contamination and UAVs' high mobility in 3D. Moreover, the increasingly popular applications relying on a large group of coordinated UAVs or UAV swarm as well as the practical hybrid GBS beamforming architecture for massive MIMO further complicate the pilot contamination and channel/beam tracking problems. In this article, we provide an overview of the above challenging issues, propose new solutions to cope with them, and discuss promising directions for future research. Preliminary simulation results are also provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.",

      "abstract": "In the future, connected vehicles and automated factories will increasingly use wireless communication. Because the cost of communication failures in these applications is high, the wireless networks must be reliable and continuously monitored. To address this need, we propose a general approach to determine the reliability of wireless networks and describe implementations of it. Our approach focuses on checking necessary assumptions instead of assuming they are fulfilled. We successfully tested our methods in an operating industrial environment. Our tests show that both the initial measurement of the reliability of the wireless network and continued monitoring are a helpful tool for factory operators. In the future, methods such as those described in this article should be used to ensure the reliable operation of wireless networks in critical scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The upcoming high-speed wireless communication systems will be hosted by millimeter- and sub-millimeter-wave frequency bands. At these frequencies, electromagnetic waves suffer from severe propagation losses and non-line-of-sight scenarios. A new wireless communication paradigm has arrived to resolve this situation through the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). These metadevices are designed to reconfigure the wireless environment in a smart way. Traditional RIS designs based on the implementation of 2D configurations have been considered up to now. However, 3D structures enable an extra degree of freedom in the design that can be taken as an advantage for the development of improved RIS structures with advanced functionalities. This article proposes the implementation of a novel electronically reconfigurable RIS based on the use of 3D graphene meta-atoms. The reconfigurability lies in the graphene conductivity, easily tunable with a biasing voltage. Different conductivity values vary the meta-atom electromagnetic response, modifying the RIS functionality. A multi-objective optimization framework determines the optimal phase state of each meta-atom to accomplish the desired RIS performance. The operation of the RIS as an efficient beam steerer/ splitter, absorber, and polarization selector is validated with full-wave results.",

      "abstract": "In millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, beam management has been recognized as an essential technique to ensure robust communication links. Recently, as an interest in developing a faster and more accurate beam management algorithm was triggered, various approaches have been devised and theoretically proved. However, most researchers have great difficulty in experimentally demonstrating realistic performance, since implementing the entire system in the mmWave band is another difficult challenge. In this article, we provide a well balanced understanding of those two essential technologies for mmWave communications: hardware technologies for prototyping and signal processing techniques for beam management. This article investigates the recent developments and future challenges to contribute to this active research area. Various commercial state-of-the-art mmWave system hardware components and beam management algorithms are comprehensively classified and compared. Meanwhile, the article provides a demonstration study based on the location-aided beam alignment algorithm by using an mmWave system prototype. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and some future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Driven by the recent technological advances and the flourishing innovative applications, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising computing paradigm, aiming to extend cloud computing services from the centralized cloud to the edges of networks. Indeed, it is an essential component in the fifth generation architecture, which can empower users with rapid and powerful computation, cache capacity, energy efficiency, mobility, location, and context awareness support. However, as network access methods become diverse, how to ensure ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in MEC is a very challenging task. This article tries to present a comprehensive survey of relevant research and technological developments in MEC. We first highlight the advantages of MEC in comparison with mobile cloud computing, based on which we then make a holistic overview of MEC, including its related architectures and key enablers. Subsequently, we introduce several specific themes and the existing techniques in MEC, where we are particularly concerned with efficient communication techniques and reliable mechanisms in MEC. Furthermore, we elaborate on the evolution of MEC standardization and discuss several typical application scenarios. Finally, we strive to shed light on some challenges and potential research directions for MEC, which may facilitate the transformation of MEC from theory to practice.",

      "abstract": "Mobility is an essential factor in the 5G core network (CN). If the network control plane can predict mobility, the operation will be more efficient and agile with intelligent and proactive decisions. So far, mobility patterns and their prediction models have been extensively studied in the research community with cellular network datasets. Recently, 3GPP initiated the specification of a CN architecture for data analysis and machine learning. In this article, in accordance with this trend, we provide a taxonomy of mobility prediction frameworks in 5G CNs ranging from data collection to model serving, with consideration of the 3GPP architecture and interfaces; and we introduce two key use cases in 5G CNs, where the gains from mobility predictions are evaluated on datasets from live networks. In particular, one of the proposed methods, machine-learning-assisted adaptive paging, reduces signaling overhead by up to 75 percent.",

      "abstract": "Modulation compression is a technique considered in the recent Open-RAN (O-RAN) framework, which has continued the 3GPP effort toward the definition of new virtualized and multi-vendor RAN architectures. Basically, fronthaul compression is achieved by means of reducing the modulation order, thus enabling a dramatic reduction of the required fronthaul capacity with a simple technique. In this work, we provide a survey of the architectures, functional splits, and fronthaul compression techniques envisioned in 3GPP and O-RAN. Then we focus on assessing the trade-offs that modulation compression exhibits in terms of reduced fronthaul capacity vs. the impact on the air interface performance, through a dynamic multi-cell system-level simulation. For that, we use an ns-3-based system-level simulator compliant with 5G New Radio (NR) specifications and evaluate different traffic load conditions and NR numerolo-gies. In a multi-cell scenario, our results show that an 82 percent reduction of the required fronthaul capacity can be achieved with negligible air interface performance degradation by reducing the modulation order down to 64-QAM for different numerologies and load conditions. A higher modulation order reduction without degradation is permitted in low/medium traffic loads (reaching up to 94 percent fronthaul capacity reduction).",

      "abstract": "The sixth generation (6G) of wireless systems are likely to operate in environments and scales that wireless services have not penetrated effectively. Many of these environments are not suitable for efficient data bearing wave propagation. Molecular signals have the potential to deliver information by exploiting both new modulation mechanisms via chemical encoding and new multi-scale propagation physics. While the fusion of biophysical models and communication theory has rapidly advanced the molecular communication field, there is a lack of real-world macro-scale applications. Here, we introduce application areas in defense and security, ranging from underwater search and rescue to covert communications; and cyber-physical systems, such as using molecular signals for health monitoring in underground networked systems. These engineering applications not only demand new wireless communication technologies ranging from DNA encoding to molecular graph signal processing, but also demonstrate the potential for molecular communication to contribute in traditional but challenging engineering areas. Together, it is increasingly believed that molecular communication can be a new physical layer for 6G, accessing and extracting data from extreme wave-denied environments.",

While the Cloud Native Computing Foundation has standardized and improved several features in Kubernetes, one of the challenges remaining is that using multiple clouds simultaneously and dynamically, for example, in a hybrid-cloud setting, is not possible. We address this crucial challenge by integrating the multi-cloud computing solution Federated Kubernetes with the emerging multi-cloud networking tool Network Service Mesh (NSM). This is the first solution for enabling Kubernetes-based multi-cloud workloads with seamless connectivity meeting the requirements for multi-cloud services and the telco industry in 5G and beyond systems.",

Consequently, we argue that multi-connectivity (MC) is an effective solution to leverage the limited radio resources from multiple base stations in order to enhance user throughput, provide seamless connectivity, and increase data reliability. For this, we study different MC architectures, where distinct network entities and protocol layers are used to split or aggregate the user traffic. The benefits and challenges of MC are analyzed as well as the open issues that network/device vendors and mobile network operators have to address for its use. Finally, through experimental evaluations, we illustrate the importance of MC design decisions for overall network performance.",

      "abstract": "The broad range of requirements of IoT applications has led to the development of several dedicated communication technologies, each tailored to meet a specific feature set. A solution combining different wireless technologies in one device can overcome the disadvantages of any individual technology. The design of such multi-RAT solutions based on the diverse characteristics of the technologies offers interesting opportunities. We have assessed both the potential gains and the overhead brought by a multi-RAT solution. To that end, we have evaluated key IoT node requirements in function of payload size and link quality: energy efficiency, coverage, payload size, latency performance, QoS, and cost efficiency. Our assessment and experimental validation of these features show the merits of a multi-RAT solution. Notably, energy consumption in use cases with only sporadic large payload requirements can be improved by a factor of at least 4 with respect to single-mode technologies. Moreover, latency-critical messages can get delivered on time, and coverage can be extended elegantly where needed.",

Actually, network asymmetries (ADSL, satellite) are frequently observed, and some network paths can flow packets in only one direction (e.g., due to a firewall). This article proposes to consider the more generic notion of unidirectional flows. Based on them, we design and implement Multiflow QUIC, a variant of QUIC that is aware of network asymmetries to spread data over multiple network paths. Our evaluation shows that this more generic approach is beneficial in asymmetric cases while being equivalent to multipath approaches in symmetric ones.",

Numerical results show that multipath routing can decrease the probability of blocking by one order of magnitude in relation to its single-path counterpart, but produce acceptable differential delay values.",

      "abstract": "The fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks aims at providing very high data rates, ultra-reliable low latency, and massive connection density. As one of the fundamental design trends toward these objectives, 5G exploits multi-connectivity (i.e., the concurrent use of multiple access networks), where multipath transport protocols have emerged as key technology enablers. The scheduler of a multipath transport protocol determines how to distribute the data packets onto different paths and has a critical impact on the protocol performance. Within this context, we present in this article the first empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art multipath schedulers based on real 5G data, for both static and mobile scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce M-Peekaboo, which builds on a state-of-the-art learning-based multipath scheduler and extends its usage to 5G networks. Our results illustrate the benefits of employing a learning-based multipath scheduler for 5G networks and motivate further studies of advanced learning schemes that can adapt more quickly to the path conditions, and take into account the emerging features and requirements of 5G and beyond networks.",

      "abstract": "Broader applications of the Internet of Things (loT) are expected in the forthcoming 6G system, although massive loT is already a key scenario in 5G, predominantly relying on physical layer solutions inherited from 4G LTE and primarily using orthogonal multiple access (OMA). In 6G loT, supporting a massive number of connections will be required for diverse services of the vertical sectors, prompting fundamental studies on how to improve the spectral efficiency of the system. One of the key enabling technologies is non-or-thogonal multiple access (NOMA). This article consists of two parts. In the first part, finite block length theory and the diversity order of multi-user systems are used to show the significant potential of NOMA compared to traditional OMA. The supremacy of NOMA over OMA is particularly pronounced for asynchronous contention-based systems relying on imperfect link adaptation, which are commonly assumed for massive loT systems. To approach these performance bounds, in the second part of the article, several promising technology directions are proposed for 6G massive loT, including linear spreading, joint spreading and modulation, multi-user channel coding in the context of various techniques for practical uncoordinated transmissions, cell-free operations, and so on, from the perspective of NOMA.",

      "abstract": "Efficient monitoring plays a vital role in software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled 5G networks, involving the monitoring of performance metrics for both physical and virtual networks and considering the requirements of a variety of traffic types originating from different applications. However, conventional network monitoring tools based on traditional IP-based mechanisms may not be able to keep up with the dynamic nature of 5G networks. Network tomography (NT) is an emerging monitoring approach that estimates network performance based on measurements realized at a limited subset of network elements, presenting benefits over traditional monitoring techniques, but susceptible to identifiability issues. In this article, we demonstrate how NT can respond to current monitoring challenges, complementing and working together with SDN, yielding accurate estimations with low overhead, while exploiting SDN capabilities such as the centralized view of the entire network, direct flow-level measurements, and controllable routing. Furthermore, we present the spectrum of applications of NT-based solutions in 5G networks and beyond, ranging from virtual to vehicular networks.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) has imposed a worldwide lockdown, changing the way people live and work, and pressuring the healthcare systems in many countries. Contact tracing based on smartphone apps (app-based contact tracing) has emerged as a possible solution to trace contagions and enforce more sustainable and selective quarantines. However, these apps require a very high adoption rate to reach the critical mass for effective contact tracing. As an alternative, network-based contact tracing, which exploits geo-localization in next generation networks (e.g., 5G) can be used by mobile operators (MOs) to passively trace users' mobility and contacts, provided that a targeted localization accuracy of down to one meter can be achieved. To effectively trace contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known by governmental authorities (GAs), are also required. Hence, in network-based contact tracing, MOs and GAs must exchange users' privacy-sensitive data, as geo-locations and infection status, to compute the likelihood that an individual has been infected. To address the privacy issues raised by network contact tracing, after presenting an overview of app-based vs. network-based contact tracing systems, we propose a protocol to make network-based systems compliant with stringent privacy requirements. From extensive simulations, we observe that the cost to guarantee privacy (evaluated in terms of data overhead introduced by the protocol) is acceptable. Finally, we elaborate on the advantages of the proposed system (e.g., more efficient monitoring of virus spread), as well as on the open issues that should be solved before its adoption (e.g., extensive research on potential privacy leakage is required).",

Proliferation of this technology requires higher data rates, reliability, resilience, and lower latency beyond what is currently offered by 5G. Thus, DT can become a major driver for 6G research and development. Alternatively, 6G network development can benefit from DT technology and its powerful features such as modularity and remote intelligence. Using DT, a 6G network (or some of its components) will have the opportunity to use artificial intelligence more proactively in order to enhance its resilience. DT's application in telecommunications is still in its infancy. In this article, we highlight some of the most promising research and development directions for this technology.",

      "abstract": "Exerting cyber-control over any natural resource and process has seen explosive growth, yielding technological breakthroughs in recent years. This impressive growth has so far stemmed from a horizontal expansion of control across application sectors, such as industrial, business, and household task automations. This article proposes cyber-control vertically across all application sectors, increasing its penetration to the programmable physics level. First, the foundations for a novel architecture for software-defined and interconnected multiphysics-as-an-app (MaaP) is introduced in this article. MaaP will allow for programmable control over the flow of electromagnetic, mechanical, thermal, and acoustic energy, even in ways not common in nature. MaaP is leveraged by next generation, interconnected, and smart artificial materials, which are explained and modeled in this article. A complete MaaP system architecture is introduced, covering the deployment, software, and communication aspects across multiple scales. Further, some research challenges posed by MaaP are presented. Moreover, unique applications such as products with real-time software-augmented physical properties are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Achieving higher spectral efficiency is an efficient approach to address the bandwidth crisis of optical networks, but it faces significant technical challenges. High-spectral-efficiency non-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (NOFDM) has been proposed for meeting the requirement of optical networks' capacity upgrade. Compared to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, NOFDM can achieve higher spectral efficiency by compressing the subcarrier spacing narrower than the Nyquist orthogonal spacing, but this inevitably induces inter-carrier interference (ICI). ICI cancellation algorithms are crucial in NOFDM for correctly recovering the transmitted signal at the expense of extra processing power. Nowadays, processing power is no longer the obstacle to eliminate ICI due to the rapid development of application-specific integrated circuits for efficient implementation of digital signal processing. In this article, fast multiplexing and demultiplexing for NOFDM are implemented based on inverse fast Fourier transform and fast Fourier transform, respectively. Meanwhile, three representative ICI cancellation algorithms are discussed, and one of them is experimentally implemented. Furthermore, we propose non-orthogonal discrete multitone (NODMT) by integrating the advantages of NOFDM and DMT, which has the potential to achieve improved spectral efficiency for future optical networks.",

While constructing smart cities under the support of IoT, cloud computing, and the Internet, smart cities' vertical market system is modeled from the economy's viewpoint. The model's security and confidentiality are analyzed via simulation. The details on the vertical market are explored from the economic perspective. System performance analysis proves the built system's security performance for data transmission under six different channels. From the vertical market's perspective, the total joint operation mode sales exceed those of self-operation mode. The sales volume of every supplier is lower than the self-operated retailer. From the operating costs' perspective, self-operated retailers have the advantage of higher retail prices and lower unit operating costs compared to joint-operated suppliers. Therefore, the built system has good stability, and the self-operated retailers have more advantages from the vertical market perspective, which can provide an experimental reference for the construction of smart cities and economic development in the future.",

      "abstract": "While video-on-demand still takes up the lion's share of Internet traffic, we are witnessing a significant increase in the adoption of mobile applications defined by tight bit rate and latency requirements (e.g., augmented/virtual reality). Supporting such applications over a mobile network is very challenging due to the unsteady nature of the network and the long distance between the users and the application back-end, which usually sits in the cloud. To address these and other challenges, like security, reliability, and scalability, a new paradigm termed multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged. MEC places computational resources closer to the end users, thus reducing the overall end-to-end latency and the utilization of the network backhaul. However, to adapt to the volatile nature of a mobile network, MEC applications need real-time information about the status of the radio channel. The ETSI-defined radio network information service (RNIS) is in charge of providing MEC applications with up-to-date information about the radio network. In this article, we first discuss three use cases that can benefit from the RNIS (collision avoidance, media streaming, and Industrial Internet of Things). Then we analyze the requirements and challenges underpinning the design of a scalable RNIS platform, and report on a prototype implementation and its evaluation. Finally, we provide a roadmap of future research challenges.",

      "abstract": "Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing in Edge-IoT systems, converged with machine intelligence, has the potential to enable a wide range of applications in smart homes, factories, and cities. Edge-IoT can connect many diverse devices, and IoT asset owners can run heterogeneous IoT systems supported by various vendors or service providers (SPs), using either cloud or local edge computing (or both) for resource assistance. The existing methods typically manage the systems as separate vertical silos, or in a vendor-/SP-centric way, which suffers from significant challenges. In this article, we present a novel owner-centric management paradigm named ORCA to address the gaps left by the owner-centric paradigm and empower IoT asset owners to effectively identify and mitigate potential issues in their own network premises, regardless of vendors&amp;#x0027;/SPs&amp;#x0027; situations. ORCA aims to be scalable and extensible in assisting IoT owners to perform intelligent management through a behavior-oriented and data-driven approach. ORCA is an ongoing project, and the preliminary results indicate that it can significantly empower IoT system owners to better manage their IoT assets.",

Despite the benefits of 5G, including ultra-low latency, flexibility, increased bandwidth, and scalability, 5G security is still a topic of debate to figure out whether it can fully support the security requirements of vehicular networks. In this article, we discuss the present security solutions offered by 5G and discuss their impact on the current security standards that have been specifically developed for vehicular networks. We also identify the challenges and issues that must be addressed in order to provide seamless integration of 5G security with the current security standards used in vehicular networks.",

      "abstract": "In the context of sixth-generation (6G) networks, emergency management systems based on wireless communications have recently gained increasing interest. Hereby, fundamentals and open problems of post-disaster communications are discussed, especially focusing on their topological aspects. The motivation behind this choice is that whenever a natural or man-made disaster occurs, there is a high chance that the terrestrial communication infrastructure is compromised, and therefore alternative networks need to be deployed efficiently in order to enable the majority of the civilians and first responders to communicate. In this article, we first provide a brief review of existing aerial ad hoc networks for post-disaster communications. Next, we shed light on some new aspects of this problem, which are related to the topology of the network supporting the impacted area. Finally, with the aid of selected simulation results, we show how the cellular infrastructure requirements for a disaster-struck region significantly depend on its location and extension.",

      "abstract": "Many malicious activities require a large number of IP addresses for altering user identities. It is well known that a large number of IP addresses could be obtained through compromising numerous machines and building botnets. However, we recently found that a special type of off-the-shelf virtual private server (VPS), which we refer to as dynamic VPSs, can retrieve a huge number of IP addresses using just a single virtual machine. Although dynamic VPSs are intended for legitimate purposes, whether they are actually misused in malicious activities has never been investigated. In this article, we take the first step to study dynamic VPSs, with an emphasis on their security implications. We reveal that dynamic VPSs are surprisingly and extensively involved in malicious activities, explore their internal working mechanisms, and suggest that the linkage of dynamic VPSs to the security domain deserves adequate attention.",

These networked multi-agent systems require fast, communication-efficient, and distributed machine learning (ML) to provide mission-crit-ical control functionalities. Distributed ML techniques, including federated learning (FL), represent a mushrooming multidisciplinary research area weaving together sensing, communication, and learning. FL enables continual model training in distributed wireless systems: rather than fusing raw data samples at a centralized server, FL leverages a cooperative fusion approach where networked agents, connected via URLLC, act as distributed learners that periodically exchange their locally trained model parameters. This article explores emerging opportunities of FL for the next-generation networked industrial systems. Open problems are discussed, focusing on cooperative driving in connected automated vehicles and collaborative robotics in smart manufacturing.",

After summarizing the main applications and reporting their requirements, we describe the characteristics of the transdermal and in-body optical channels (OCs) as well as the challenges that they impose in the design of communication systems. Specifically, we provide three possible architectures for transdermal communications, namely electro-optical monitoring, opto-electrical, and all-optical (AO), for neural stimulation, which are currently under investigation, whereas for in-body communications, we provide a nano-scale AO concept. For each architecture, we discuss the main operation principles, the technology enablers, and research directions for their development. Finally, we highlight the necessity of designing an infor-mation-theoretic framework for the analysis and design of the physical and medium access control layers, which takes into account the channels' characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Digital contact tracing has emerged as a viable tool supplementing manual contact tracing. To date, more than 100 contact tracing applications have been published to slow down the spread of highly contagious Covid-19. Despite subtle variabilities among these applications, all of them achieve contact tracing by manipulating the following three components: use of a personal device to identify the user while designing a secure protocol to anonymize the user's identity; leverage networking technologies to analyze and store the data; and exploit rich sensing features on the user device to detect the interaction among users and thus estimate the exposure risk. This article reviews the current digital contact tracing based on these three components. We focus on two personal devices that are intimate to the user: smartphones and wearables. We discuss the centralized and decentralized networking approaches that are used to facilitate the data flow. Lastly, we investigate the sensing feature available on smartphones and wearables to detect the proximity between any two users and present experiments comparing the proximity sensing performance between these two personal devices.",

      "abstract": "With the development of ocean research, communications from the air to underwater (e.g., aircraft to submarines) are especially important. However, the existing communication methods have their own limitations and wireless communication between underwater and the air has remained an unsolved problem. In this article, we propose a photoacoustic communication based on low-cost passive relays, which is capable of not only minimizing the energy loss both in water and in the air-water interface, but also relieving the difficulty of target seeking. Thus, we can get a six order of magnitude reduction of laser energy (25 J vs. 27 \u03bcJ) using passive relays whose cost is less than US$1.00. It is also demonstrated that our photoacoustic communication can work decently under complex water situations including waving and pollution. This creationary photoacoustic application may become a practical way to communicate from the air to underwater.",

      "abstract": "As the number of blockchain (BC) platforms providing specific features increases, selecting a platform that fits all requirements needed for a specific case becomes a cumbersome task. For example, not only are BCs' technical details relevant, but also their intrinsic characteristics (e.g., cryptocurrency price) must be considered in selecting a BC for a given case. Hence, the management of data stored in multiple BCs and the selection process are not straightforward due to the myriad platforms and both technical and economic details (e.g., BC throughput and the underlying price fluctuation). This article defines a novel refinement flow (based on the policy continuum) of high-level BC selection policies to low-level BC transactions. Experiments with the BC selection framework developed applying policy-based management (PBM) in the BC context do show that such synergy simplifies data management in multiple BCs driven by user requirements (e.g., based on costs or performance policies). The performance analysis of the framework demonstrates the successful employment of PBM for BC selections with minimal overhead.",

      "abstract": "In future wireless systems, a large number of users may access the networks via moving relays (MRs) installed on top of vehicles. One of the main challenges of MRs is rapid channel variation, which may make channel estimation and its following procedures difficult. To address these issues, various schemes are designed, among which the predictor antenna (PA) is a candidate. The PA setup refers to a system with two (sets of) antennas on top of a vehicle, where the PA(s) positioned in front of the vehicle is (are) utilized to predict the channel state information required for data transmission to the receive antennas aligned behind the PA. In this article, we introduce the concept and the potential of PA systems. Moreover, summarizing the field trials for PAs and the 3GPP attempts on (moving) relays, we compare the performance of different PA and non-PA methods for vehicle communications in both urban and rural areas with the PA setup backhauled through terrestrial or satellite technology, respectively. As we show, with typical parameter settings and vehicle speeds, a single-antenna PA-assisted setup can boost the backhaul throughput of MRs, compared to state-of-the-art open-loop schemes, by up to 50 percent.",

      "abstract": "From June 2019 to March 2020, IETF conducted a selection process to choose password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols for standardization. Similar standardization efforts were conducted before by IEEE (P1362.2) and ISO/IEC (11770\u20134). An important hallmark for this IETF selection process is its openness: anyone can nominate any candidate; all reviews are public; and all email discussions on the IETF mailing lists are archived and publicly readable. However, despite the openness, it is unclear whether this IETF selection process has presented a successful model. Several important questions that were raised during the selection process remained unaddressed even after the two winners (CPace and OPAQUE) were announced. We reflect on the IETF PAKE selection process as a case study, and summarize lessons in a set of principles with the hope of improving security standardization in the future.",

This work analyzes the applicability of 5G technologies as key enablers to support, enhance, and even enable novel advances in Industry 4.0. It proposes a complete 5G solution for two real-world Industry 4.0 use cases related to metrology and quality control. This solution uses 5Growth to ease and automate the management of vertical services over a soft-ware-defined network and network function virtualization based 5G mobile transport and computing infrastructure, and to aid the integration of the verticals' private 5G network with the public network. Finally, a validation campaign assesses the applicability of the proposed solution to support the performance requirements (especially latency and user data rate) of the selected use cases, and evaluates its efficiency regarding vertical service setup time across different domains in less than three minutes.",

      "abstract": "Progress in communication technologies has fostered the development of advanced interactive applications that require multi-sensor data transmission with low latency and high reliability. Since these requirements are not guaranteed by current application-agnostic transport protocols, these applications mostly have to rely on customized, application-level scheduling and flow control mechanisms, which lack generality and transparency, making it difficult to jointly control the information flows of different applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to support the transmission of correlated data flows. We assume that the applications are able to describe the correlation among their data streams and the related service requirements in terms of a value of information (VoI) matrix. Hence, we propose QUIC-EST, a transmission scheme that combines the congestion control and multi-stream features of the recently proposed QUIC transport protocol with a proper scheduling algorithm to maximize the VoI at the receiver. To illustrate the idea, we propose the analysis of two relevant use cases, namely inter-vehicular and haptic communications, and demonstrate through simulations how the proposed approach can significantly outperform current transport schemes.",

However, safe and efficient driving, especially of automated vehicles, may be affected by sudden changes of the provided QoS. For that reason, the prediction of QoS changes and early notification of these predicted changes to vehicles recently have been enabled by 5G communication systems. This solution enables the vehicles to avoid or mitigate the effect of sudden QoS changes at the application level. This article describes how QoS prediction could be generated by a 5G communication system and delivered to a V2X application. The tele-operated driving use case is used as an example to analyze the feasibility of a QoS prediction scheme. Useful recommendations for the development of a QoS prediction solution are provided, while open research topics are identified.",

      "abstract": "Military networks, and especially tactical networks, have become crucial in conducting military actions. With images and videos being rich sources of information, a primary challenge in military networks is to be able to issue a query over a (large) distributed set of devices to find concrete actions or objects of interest. The problem inherent to this scenario is how to gather this information in an optimal way, depending on the objective, for further processing. To this end, in this work we present three different approaches, with different objectives, for using video analytics to label and collect the right information that is stored on mobile devices. We first present a solution for crowdsourcing devices to label videos that contain objects and actions of interest in a minimum amount of time. We then present a solution for gathering all images that contain objects of interest at a central server where a complete search of images stored on the mobile devices is completed as fast as possible. Finally, we consider the case in which we desire to collect images that contain objects of interest as fast as possible, perhaps at the expense of the overall search time taking longer. In all three cases, we divide processing responsibilities between mobile devices where the videos/images are stored and the edge cloud.",

In many countries, drastic restrictive measures adopted by political authorities, such as national lockdowns, have not prevented the outbreak of the new pandemic's waves. In this article, we propose an integrated detection-estimation-forecasting framework that, using publicly available data, is designed to: learn relevant features of the pandemic (e.g., the infection rate); detect as quickly as possible the onset (or the termination) of an exponential growth of the contagion; and reliably forecast the pandemic evolution. The proposed solution is validated by analyzing the COVID-19 second and third waves in the United States.",

      "abstract": "Novel sensing and communication techniques have accelerated the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) with the manufacturing industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) today requires more agile and unobtrusive sensing and communication to observe the underlying industrial resources and physical operations. Information-driven decision making in the cyber space may result in collaborative automation and intelligent optimization in the physical space. Therefore, a convenient information interface that could seamlessly bridge the physical world with its corresponding information system has been a critical building block for manufacturing intelligence. In this article, we advocate the integration of wireless powering, sensing, and communication, and propose radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensing (RFID&amp;S) techniques to enhance the efficiency and convenience of data collection and integration for IIoT innovations. We first provide the fundamentals of RFID&amp;S including radio frequency energy harvesting and communication interface. Then we present a novel UHF-HF dual-mode RFID sensor scheme with implementations using commercial off-the-shelf components for the first time, and also illustrate the establishment of RFID&amp;S-based industrial monitoring and data integration systems. Finally, the advantages of RFID&amp;S in unobtrusive online sensing, and its capability of extending the information link for IIoT applications are elaborated. An exemplary use case of the proposed RFID&amp;S techniques is provided to suggest its potential applications and show its adaptation to industrial process control and integration.",

      "abstract": "Robotic factory floors are transforming the manufacturing sector by delivering an unprecedented boost to productivity. However, such a paradigm raises questions on safety and coordination, especially when in the presence of unexpected events. Time-critical communication messages for such industrial robots mandate the requirement of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Classical WiFi-connected industrial robots often suffer from the traditional dense network problems prevalent in production WiFi networks, where transmission of an emergency notification packet is \u201cbest effort,\u201d devoid of time guarantees. In this work, we propose a machine-learning-based framework called ReLy that intelligently embeds the time-critical messages in the preamble of outgoing frames at the transmitter. These messages are inferred from the channel state information variations at the receiver. As ReLy is implemented entirely at the physical layer, the transmitter is able to deliver information within 5 ms latency and ultra-high reliability of 99 percent. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of achieving URLLC with moving robots in a busy workshop with a number of other peer robots, equipment, desks, and robotic arms, as expected in a typical factory setting.",

      "abstract": "By thoroughly transforming the traditional base-station-centric architecture to user-centric architecture, user-centric networking (UCN), a promising technology with disruptive innovation, will provide better services for users in the next generation communication systems. As another promising technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which has been widely explored by academia and industry, can be used to implement bypassing obstacle communication, optimizing interference management, and reducing energy consumption in UCN. To achieve low-cost, highly robust, and energy-efficient user-centric communication, we propose a novel RIS integrated UCN architecture. In the proposed architecture, RIS is used to extend service coverage, enhance service quality, suppress interference, as well as provide low-cost and highly energy-efficient user-centric communication by replacing some required access points in UCN. To further exploit the advantages of RIS, we perform joint optimization on passive beamforming and power allocation, aiming to maximize the sum rate of all users. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization scheme outperforms reference schemes in terms of sum rate and energy efficiency.",

In this article, we aim to answer four fundmental questions: 1) Why do we need RISs? 2) What is an RIS? 3) What are RIS's applications? 4) What are the relevant challenges and future research directions? In response, eight promising research directions are pointed out.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in the fabrication and experimentation of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have motivated the concept of the smart radio environment, according to which the propagation of information-bearing waveforms in the wireless medium is amenable to programmability. Although the vast majority of recent experimental research on RIS-empowered wireless communications gravitates around narrowband beamforming in quasi-free space, RISs are foreseen to revolutionize wideband wireless connectivity in dense urban as well as indoor scenarios, which are usually characterized as strongly reverberant environments exhibiting severe multipath conditions. In this article, capitalizing on recent physics-driven experimental explorations of RIS-empowered wave propagation control in complex scattering cavities, we identify the potential of the spatio-temporal control offered by RISs to boost wireless communications in rich scattering channels via two case studies. First, an RIS is deployed to shape the multipath channel impulse response, which is shown to enable higher achievable communication rates. Second, the RIS-tunable propagation environment is leveraged as an analog multiplexer to localize non-cooperative objects using wave fingerprints, even when they are outside the line of sight. Future research challenges and opportunities in the algorithmic design and experimentation of smart rich scattering wireless environments enabled by RISs for sixth generation wireless communications are discussed.",

A key element toward building smart and energy sustainable wireless systems beyond 5G is the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which offers programmable control and shaping of the wireless propagation environment. Capitalizing on this technology potential, in this article we introduce two new concepts: i) wireless environment as a service, which leverages a novel RIS-empowered networking paradigm to trade off diverse, and usually conflicting, connectivity objectives; and ii) performance-boosted areas enabled by RIS-based connectivity, representing competing service provisioning areas that are highly spatially and temporally focused. We discuss the key technological enablers and research challenges with the proposed networking paradigm, and highlight the potential profound role of RISs in the recent Open Radio Access Network architecture.",

      "abstract": "Recently, extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing beyond fifth generation (B5G), also referred to as sixth generation (6G) wireless networks aimed at bringing ultra-reli-able low-latency communication services. 6G is expected to extend 5G capabilities to higher communication levels where numerous connected devices and sensors can operate seamlessly. One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), as one of the three application scenarios of the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, has attracted extensive attention in the industry. URLLC can play an important role in many scenarios such as traffic safety, remote surgery, and unmanned driving. However, the existing technology is not enough to fully meet its business requirements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is promising to solve the technical problems in the URLLC communication scenario. As a branch of machine learning, deep learning has made a lot of achievements in academia and industry in recent years. It has become one of the landmark technologies of AI. Deep learning can optimize the system end to end, effectively process massive data, and cope with complex channel changes. It is considered as one of the practical tools to deal with physical layer communication. In this article, we first introduce the performance indicators and critical technologies of URLLC in the physical layer. Then we expound on the advantages of deep learning in solving technical problems in the physical layer. Finally, the challenge and opportunity of URLLC based on AI in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks are presented.",

      "abstract": "We advocate a new resource allocation framework, which we call resource rationing, for wireless federated learning (FL). Unlike existing resource allocation methods for FL, resource rationing focuses on balancing resources across learning rounds so that their collective impact on FL performance is explicitly captured. This new framework can be integrated seamlessly with existing resource allocation schemes to optimize the convergence of FL. In particular, a novel &amp;#x201C;lat-er-is-better&amp;#x201D; principle is at the front and center of resource rationing and is validated empirically in several instances of wireless FL. We also point out technical challenges and research opportunities that are worth pursuing. Resource rationing highlights the benefits of treating the emerging FL as a new class of service that has its own characteristics, and designing communication algorithms for this particular service.",

      "abstract": "Timestamping services are used to prove that a data item existed at a given point in time. This proof is represented by a timestamp token that is created by a timestamping authority. ISO/ IEC 18014 specifies timestamping services and requires them to hold the following two properties: (1) The data being timestamped is not disclosed to the timestamping authority; hash values of the data are provided to the authority instead. (2) A timestamp token can be renewed; as a result, the validity duration of a timestamp token is not restricted by the lifetimes of underlying algorithms or policies. In this article, we review this standard and discover several issues: Due to inconsistent writing or information missing, a timestamping service following the standard specification may not be able to achieve these designed properties. We provide a solution to each issue.",

      "abstract": "Network operators are looking toward LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) as a means of extending capacity by offloading traffic to unlicensed bands. However, operation in these bands requires abiding by certain coexistence rules in terms of channel access. The description of these rules in the existing literature is not always in line with the latest standards. Therefore, in this article, we clarify the operation of LAA, focusing on channel access and methods of providing quality of service (QoS) support. In terms of coexistence, we evaluate the impact of LAA under its various QoS settings on WiFi performance in an experimental testbed. Finally, we describe the upcoming research challenges for LTE-based technologies in unlicensed bands considering the latest developments.",

Viewers are spoiled for choice, and content providers compete to provide the best viewer experience. Traditionally, it has been challenging for content providers to get deep insights into the performance of their large-scale streaming operations. A new standard, Common Media Client Data (CMCD), aims to fundamentally change this. After providing an overview of this standard and describing some possible application scenarios, we present an open source sample implementation for readers to explore this topic further in their own practical environments.",

This article focuses on 5G/B5G-enabled terrestrial robotic communications with an emphasis on distinct characteristics of such communications. First, signal and spatial modeling for robotic communications are presented. To elaborate further, both the benefits and challenges derived from robots&amp;#x0027; mobility are discussed. As a further advance, a novel simultaneous localization and radio mapping (SLARM) framework is proposed for integrating localization and communications into robotic networks. Furthermore, dynamic trajectory design and resource allocation for both indoor and outdoor robots are provided to verify the performance of robotic communications in the context of typical robotic application scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Secure bootstrapping of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is often a multi-step process that begins with enabling Internet access through a local wireless network. The process of enabling Internet access on IoT devices includes network discovery and selection, access authentication, and configuration of necessary credentials and parameters. On one hand, there are many standard protocols available for network access authentication of IoT devices. On the other hand, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a standard framework with support for many authentication methods, and it is primarily used for network access authentication in enterprise networks. This article discusses whether the EAP framework is beneficial for network access authentication of IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "Short-packet communication is a key technology to support two emerging application scenarios in 5G and beyond 5G, massive machine type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC), which are introduced to satisfy the broader communication requirements of potential applications such as the Internet of Vehicles and industrial Internet of Things (IoT). The sharp increase in privacy data in various IoT applications has made security issues more prominent. The typical upper-layer encryption mechanism cannot fully address the security challenge considering the resource restriction of IoT terminals. In this article, we investigate secure short-packet communication from the perspective of physical layer security (PLS), which can be regarded as a promising security solution in 6G. Specifically, the state-of-the-art development of fundamental information theory of secure short-packet communications and corresponding performance evaluation criteria in fading channels are summarized. Then we review recent works, which investigate short-packet communication systems in different communication scenarios or with different security strategies from the perspective of PLS. Finally, we give future research directions and challenges.",

In this context, this work takes a step toward the 6G vision by proposing a next generation communication platform, which aims to extend the rigid coverage area of fixed deployment networks by considering virtual mobile small cells (MSCs) that are created on demand. Relying on emerging computing paradigms such as network function virtualization and software defined networking, these cells can harness radio and networking capability, locally reducing protocol signaling latency and overhead. These MSCs constitute an intelligent pool of networking resources that can collaborate to form a wireless network of MSCs providing a communication platform for localized, ubiquitous, and reliable connectivity. The technology enablers for implementing the MSC concept are also addressed in terms of virtualization, lightweight wireless security, and energy-efficient RF. The benefits of the MSC architecture toward reliable and efficient cell offloading are demonstrated as a use case.",

      "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a physical information system developed based on traditional industrial control networks. As one of the most critical infrastructure systems, IIoT is also a preferred target for adversaries engaged in advanced persistent threats (APTs). To address this issue, we explore a deep-learning-based proactive APT detection scheme in IIoT. In this scheme, considering the characteristics of long attack sequences and long-term continuous APT attacks, our solution adopts a well-known deep learning model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), to detect APT attack sequences. The APT attack sequence is also optimized to ensure the model's long-term sequence judgment effectiveness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed deep learning method has feasibility and effectiveness for APT detection, but also certify that the BERT model has better accuracy and a lower false alarm rate when detecting APT attack sequences than other time series models.",

      "abstract": "One of the important characteristics envisioned for 6G is security function virtualization (SFV). Similar to network function virtualization (NFV) in 5G networks, SFV provides new opportunities for improving security while reducing the security overhead. In particular, it provides an attractive way of solving compatibility issues related to security. Malware in Internet of Things (IoT) systems is gaining popularity among cyber-criminals because of the expected number of IoT devices in 5G and 6G networks. To solve this issue, this article proposes a security framework that exploits softwarization of security functions via SFV to improve trust in IoT systems and contain the propagation of malware. IoT devices are categorized into trusted, vulnerable, and compromised levels using remote attestation. To isolate the devices in the three distinct categories, NFV is used to create separate networks for each category, and a distributed ledger is used to store the state of each device. Virtualized remote attestation routines are employed to avoid any compatibility issues among heterogeneous IoT devices and effectively contain malware propagation. The results show that the proposed framework can reduce the number of infected devices by 66 percent in only 10 seconds.",

Even though physical-layer security mechanisms leverage the advantages of flexible implementation, low complexity, and full information confidentiality, these security enhancement schemes based on digital signal processing techniques are limited by the electrical bottleneck, leading to low processing speed for encryption and incapability of effectively detecting network attacks. In this article, we first discuss the potential security threats and present several existing solutions against security threats in optical access networks from the perspective of the medium access control and physical layers. We then elaborate novel optical-layer solutions based on optical signal processing techniques including all-optical encryption, optical layer authentication, and optical domain intrusion detection mechanisms. In particular, numerical simulation results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Finally, we conclude this article and propose future challenges of security enhancement of optical access networks supporting 5G and beyond.",

But UAVs also confront severe security threats, which slows down their wide application. Current research mainly focuses on the security of a single UAV system, while paying little attention to UAV-related communications, especially in the physical and network layers. Thus, it becomes necessary to summarize potential security threats and corresponding countermeasures. To this end, we study mainstream attacks on UAV communications in order to propose security requirements. Then we present a comprehensive review on existing security countermeasures for enhancing UAV communication security in both the physical and network layers. We conclude with open issues and future prospects of UAV security.",

      "abstract": "Wireless connectivity has traditionally been regarded as an opaque data pipe carrying messages, whose context-dependent meaning and effectiveness have been ignored. Nevertheless, in emerging cyber-physical and autonomous networked systems, acquiring, processing, and sending excessive amounts of distributed real-time data, which ends up being stale or useless to the end user, will cause communication bottlenecks, increased latency, and safety issues. We envision a communication paradigm shift, which makes the semantics of information (i.e., the significance and usefulness of messages) the foundation of the communication process. This entails a goal-orient-ed unification of information generation, transmission, and reconstruction, by taking into account process dynamics, signal sparsity, data correlation, and semantic information attributes. We apply this structurally new, synergetic approach to a communication scenario where the destination is tasked with real-time source reconstruction for the purpose of remote actuation. Capitalizing on semantics-empowered sampling and communication policies, we show significant reduction in both reconstruction error and cost of actuation error, as well as in the number of uninformative samples generated.",

      "abstract": "5G networks have been widely deployed all over the world, which involve massive multiple-in-put multiple-output (MIMO), millimeter-wave communication, and other technologies to improve the performance of the whole system. In contrast, the emerging key technologies including terahertz (THz) communication, intelligent reflective surface (IRS), blockchain, and so on have been proposed to enhance the signal quality for the future 6G networks. IRS can program the signal propagation by intelligently controlling a large number of passive reflecting elements, and blockchain can improve the system security in the whole communication process. The article provides a survey of the recent research and compares the system performance between 5G and 6G, which can bring about the rapid increase in wireless data traffic and the achievable rate can be reached up to terabits per second to improve the communication quality dramatically.",

The received signal in MC inevitably encounters severe inter-symbol interference and signal-dependent noise due to the stochastic diffusion mechanism. Focusing on the critical signal detection in MC, first this article reviews the commonly used model-based detectors and exposes their limitations in practical implementation. Then the emerging data-driven detectors that can make up for some deficiencies of the model-based detectors are presented. Despite the black-box nature of the data-driven detectors, the explainable artificial intelligence can be further investigated for the performance improvement of transparency and trust. Finally, some open research issues and future research directions in receiver design are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Only radio access networks can provide connectivity across multiple antenna sites to achieve the great leap forward in capacity targeted by 5G. Optical fronthaul remains a sticking point in that connectivity, and we make the case for analog radio over fiber signals and an optical access network smart edge to achieve the potential of radio access networks. The edge of the network would house the intelligence that coordinates wireless transmissions to minimize interference and maximize throughput. As silicon photonics provides a hardware platform well adapted to support optical fronthaul, it is poised to drive smart edge adoption. We draw out the issues in adopting our solution, propose a strategy for network densification, and cite recent demonstrations to support our approach.",

Migrating to ever higher carrier frequencies will require increasingly directional beamforming to establish and maintain the link. Intelligent beam management (BM) protocols will be critical for establishing and maintaining connections between the base station and user equipment in a dynamic channel. This article first provides a brief overview of the BM protocol in Release 15 of 5G New Radio, then identifies six major challenges to BM for later 5G releases that will likely persist into 6G. We describe the trends and issues behind each of the six challenges, and provide recommendations and suggested research directions to address them.",

To enable this epic leap in communications, this article provides an overview and outlook on the application of sparse code multiple access (SCMA) for 6G wireless communication systems, which is an emerging disruptive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for the enabling of massive connectivity. We propose to apply SCMA to a massively distributed access system whose architecture is based on fiber-based visible light communication, ultra-dense networks, and NOMA. Under this framework, we consider the interactions between optical fronthauls and wireless access links. In order to stimulate more upcoming research in this area, we outline a number of promising directions associated with SCMA for faster, more reliable, and more efficient multiple access in future 6G communication networks.",

      "abstract": "6G communication research is currently in the early stage. A consensus on 6G has been achieved that ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is still an important application as it is in 5G. The spectrum resources are scarce to support the massive throughput demands, leading to unbearable latency. Also, the collisions in the shared spectrum make the channels unreliable. The problems in unlicensed bands are more severe due to interference among multiple communication technologies. Therefore, it is urgent to design efficient spectrum sharing algorithms to support URLLC in 5G and the emerging 6G. In this article, we explore the related 3GPP standards, recall the recent advances in spectrum sharing algorithms, and analyze the challenges of spectrum sharing in 5G/6G. We also provide potential research fields in future 5G/6G applications.",

Multi-gigabit-per-second and terabit-per-second are the new units to measure the data demand of emerging applications such as 8K video, e-health, extended reality, vehicle-to-everything, and many others. Actual wireless networks are based on the fiber substrate that feeds, by fixed access points, a wireless layer for distribution to users at much lower capacity, posing a limit to the introduction of data-hungry applications. To increase the area capacity of the wireless distribution layer, a ubiquitous data source is needed. A wireless layer to transport data at the rooftop level is conceived to wirelessly replicate the data provision of the fiber substrate, with unlimited access flexibility. This new layer is fed by fiber and provides to the wireless distribution layer arbitrarily distributed links for ubiquitous data distribution. The architecture and enabling technology of the proposed wireless transport layer is described.",

In this article, we provide a tutorial on the development and deployment of the QoE measurement and prediction solutions for video streaming services based on supervised learning ML models. First, we provide a detailed pipeline for developing and deploying super-vised-learning-based video streaming QoE prediction models that covers several stages including data collection, feature engineering, model optimization and training, testing and prediction, and evaluation. Second, we discuss the deployment of the ML model for QoE prediction/measurement in 5G/6G networks using network-enabling technologies such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, and multi-access edge computing by proposing reference architecture. Third, we present a comparative study of the state-of-the-art supervised learning ML models for QoE prediction of video streaming applications based on multiple performance metrics.",

While 5G systems are seizing the mmWave band, the attention of researchers is shifting already to the terahertz range. In that distant land of tiny wavelengths, antenna arrays can serve for more than power-enhancing beamforming. Defying lower-frequency wisdom, spatial multiplexing becomes feasible even in line-of-sight conditions. This article reviews the underpinnings of this phenomenon, and it surveys recent results on the ensuing information-theoretic capacity. Reconfigurable array architectures are put forth that can closely approach such capacity, practical challenges are discussed, and supporting experimental evidence is presented.",

To meet these demands, the terahertz (0.1&amp;#x2013;10 THz) band comes into the horizon, with ultra-broad bandwidth and sub-millimeter wavelength, which, however, suffers from distance limitation and power consumption concerns. In this article, four interdisciplinary directions to address the above challenges and unleash the full potential of THz communications are investigated, namely, integrated sensing and communication, ultra-mas-sive MIMO and dynamic hybrid beamforming, intelligent surfaces, and machine/deep learning. Furthermore, open problems as well as integration of these solutions are elaborated. Qualitative and quantitative studies demonstrate the benefits and performance of the proposed solutions.",

Until now, the main goal of quantum communication networks has been security. However, quantum networks can do more than just exchange secure keys or serve the needs of quantum computers. In fact, the scientific community is still investigating the possible use cases/benefits that quantum communication networks can bring. Thus, this article aims to point out and clearly describe how quantum communication networks can enhance in-network distributed computing and reduce the overall end-to-end latency, beyond the intrinsic limits of classical technologies. Furthermore, we also explain how entanglement can reduce the communication complexity (overhead) that future classical virtualized networks will experience.",

      "abstract": "Cloud-network slicing is a promising approach to serve vertical industries delivering their services over multiple administrative and technological domains. However, there are numerous open challenges to provide end-to-end slices due to complex business and engineering requirements from service and resource providers. This article presents a reference architecture for the cloud-network slicing concept and the practical realization of the slice-as-a-service paradigm, which are key results from the Novel Enablers in Cloud Slicing (NECOS) project. The NECOS platform has been designed to consider modularity, separation of concerns, and multi-domain dynamic operation as prime attributes. The architecture comprises a set of interworking components to automatically create, manage, and decommission end-to-end cloud-network slice instances in a lightweight manner. NECOS orchestrates slices at runtime, spanning across core/edge data centers and wired/wireless network infrastructures. The novelties of the multi-domain NECOS platform are validated through three proof-of-concept experiments: (i) a touristic content delivery service slice deployment featuring on-demand virtual infrastructure management across three countries on different continents to meet particular slice requirements; (ii) intelligent slice elasticity driven by machine learning techniques; and (iii) market-place-based resource discovery capabilities.",

      "abstract": "While the deployment of 5G cellular systems will continue well into the next decade, much interest is already being generated toward technologies that will underlie its successor, 6G. Undeniably, 5G will have a transformative impact on the way we live and communicate, but it is still far away from supporting the Internet of Everything, where upward of 1 million devices/km<sup>3</sup> (both terrestrial and aerial) will require ubiquitous, reliable, low-latency connectivity. This article looks at some of the fundamental problems that pertain to key physical layer enablers for 6G. This includes highlighting challenges related to intelligent reflecting surfaces, cell-free massive MIMO, and THz communications. Our analysis covers theoretical modeling challenges, hardware implementation issues, and scalability, among others. The article concludes by delineating the critical role of signal processing in the new era of wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "Optical communication is developing rapidly in the directions of hardware resource diversification, transmission system flexibility, and network function virtualization. Its proliferation poses a significant challenge to traditional optical communication management and control systems. Digital twin (DT), a technology that utilizes data, models, and algorithms and integrates multiple disciplines, acts as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds for comprehensive connectivity. In the digital space, virtual models are established dynamically to simulate and describe the states, behaviors, and rules of physical objects in the physical space. DT has been significantly developed and widely applied in the industrial and military fields. This study introduces the DT technology to optical communication through interdisciplinary crossing and proposes a DT framework suitable for optical communication. The intelligent fault management model, flexible hardware configuration model, and dynamic transmission simulation model are established in the digital space with the help of deep learning algorithms to ensure the high-reliability operation and high-ef-ficiency management of optical communication systems and networks.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous robotic swarms are envisioned for a variety of sensing applications in space exploration, search and rescue, and disaster management. An important capability of a swarm is sensing spatio-temporal processes such as radio wave propagation and seismic activities. The spa-tio-temporal properties of these processes dictate the required sensing position and time accuracy, as well as update rate. A dedicated wireless communication system needs to be jointly designed for swarm information exchange, self-localization, and sensing. In this article, we emphasize the role of time in a robotic swarm. We introduce the system ingredients and dive into realistic clock models. Clock models and channel access schemes decisively influence the swarm self-localization and synchronization accuracy, and consequently the swarm sensing performance. Finally, we discuss practical implementation aspects, introduce our developed swarm radio system, and give an outlook on a moon-analog exploration mission.",

      "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has proved that the world needs to be more prepared for pandemic situations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a rise in innovation, automation, and smart Internet of Things (IoT) solutions has occurred. Smart IoT solutions are of significant importance in monitoring, contact tracing, and diagnosing/detecting COVID-19 patients. These solutions have also become vital in the continuance of regular life, work, education, and social events that would otherwise not be possible for many during quarantine conditions. Additionally, life has become challenging during COVID-19 for people in rural and remote communities with limited wireless connectivity. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks can provide wireless connectivity and, in combination with smart IoT solutions, are essential to combat COVID-19. Driven by this, we provide a review of UAV-assisted IoT networks and propose a scheduling scheme for on-demand sensing to manage the pandemic's impact. First, we discuss applications of UAV-assisted IoT networks around the world and different scenarios for utilization managing the impact of the pandemic. We then provide an overview of recent studies on UAV-assisted IoT networks for the pandemic. We then present the proposed scheduling scheme for on-demand sensing using UAV-assisted IoT networks. Next, we provide the various challenges facing the widespread utilization of UAV-assisted IoT networks. Lastly, we present possible directions for future research on this topic.",

      "abstract": "With the growth in the diversity of novel molecular communication via diffusion-based (MCvD) applications, the term synchronization can entail different technologies in MCvD-based nanonetworks - from relatively simple collaborative actions to complex symbol timing recovery. Motivated by the need for distinction or uniformity in the technologies, we introduce the notion of timing alignment, which is an umbrella term that includes any element that enables nanomachines to execute processes or actions in an organized manner. Four elements of timing alignment are identified, namely, hardware, protocol, network, and application. In a tutorial manner, the elements are described both at the microscopic level (as individual elements) and at the macroscopic level (as collective elements). A combination of existing and new knowledge is used to elicit the challenges that lie in the path of the development of MCvD-based medical systems. Timing alignment can therefore be approached either as a single topic or by its elements.",

      "abstract": "Toward 6G, we are witnessing various technology trends including network openness and open source SW-based mobile communication systems, network AI, privacy protection, virtualization and containerization, and quantum computing. These trends are expected to bring new security threats. The openness of network architecture and the wide adoption of open source may increase the attack surface in the system. An attacker may attempt to fool AI-based radio access network/core network to cause malfunction using adversarial machine learning (AML) techniques. Personalization technology in 6G also opens the door to fine-grained privacy invasion. Adoption of virtualization and containerization also introduces a new attack path, and introduction of quantum computing is expected to affect the security of existing cryptographic algorithms used in today's mobile networks. In this article, we analyze these potential new threats caused by the introduction of new technologies and present possible mitigation to address these threats.",

The effective support of such massive deployment of UAVs requires offering reliable, secure, and cost-effective wireless connectivity. Cellular networks play essential roles in serving UAVs acting as flying user equipments. While the cellular networks provide promising connectivity solutions for UAVs, enabling robust UAV operations faces several challenges. In this article, an overview of key barriers and design considerations of widespread commercial use of flying UAVs are presented along with their potential solutions. In addition, we discuss how cellular networks can support UAVs by relying on their advanced features, network intelligence, key enabling technologies for beyond 5G and 6G, and exploiting new tools from machine learning. Finally, we shed light on offering wireless services to high altitudes and the integration of non-terrestrial networks with terrestrial networks toward limitless connectivity in 6G.",

      "abstract": "The next frontier for immersive applications is enabling sentience over the Internet. Tactile Internet (TI) envisages transporting skills by providing ultra-low-latency (ULL) communications for transporting touch senses. In this work, we focus our study on the first/last mile communication, where the future generation WiFi-7 is pitched as the front-runner for ULL applications. We discuss a few candidate features of WiFi-7 and highlight its major pitfalls with respect to ULL communication. Further, through a specific implementation of WiFi-7 (vanilla WiFi-7) in our custom simulator, we demonstrate the impact of one of the pitfalls - the standard practice of using jitter buffer in conjunction with frame aggregation - on TI communication. To circumvent this, we propose the Non-Buffered Scheme (NoBuS) - a simple MAC layer enhancement for enabling TI applications over WiFi-7. NoBuS trades off packet loss for latency, enabling swift synchronization between the master and controlled domains. Our findings reveal that employing NoBuS yields a significant improvement in RMSE of TI signals. Further, we show that the worst case WiFi latency with NoBuS is 3.72 ms - an order of magnitude lower than vanilla WiFi-7 even under highly congested network conditions.",

To fulfill its promises, properly processing the data of the industrial processes and infrastructures is required. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears as a strong candidate to handle all generated data, and to help in the automation and smartification process. This article overviews the digital twin as a true embodiment of a cyber-physical system (CPS) in Industry 4.0, showing the mission of AI in this concept. It presents the key enabling technologies of the digital twin such as edge, fog, and 5G, where the physical processes are integrated with the computing and network domains. The role of AI in each technology domain is identified by analyzing a set of AI agents at the application and infrastructure levels. Finally, movement prediction is selected and experimentally validated using real data generated by a digital twin for robotic arms with results showcasing its potential.",

      "abstract": "Many machine learning (ML) techniques suffer from the drawback that their output (e.g., a classification decision) is not clearly and intuitively connected to their input (e.g., an image). To cope with this issue, several explainable ML techniques have been proposed to, for example, identify which pixels of an input image had the strongest influence on its classification. However, in distributed scenarios, it is often more important to connect decisions with the information used for the model training and the nodes supplying such information. To this end, in this article we focus on federated learning and present a new methodology, named node liability in federated learning (NL-FL), which permits identifying the source of the training information that most contributed to a given decision. After discussing NL-FL's cost in terms of extra computation, storage, and network latency, we demonstrate its usefulness in an edge-based scenario. We find that NL-FL is able to swiftly identify misbehaving nodes and to exclude them from the training process, thereby improving learning accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) into the cloud environment aims to put their on board equipment and capabilities at the service of end users at an affordable cost. Coupling both technologies will help leveraging them as a strong and novel service provider. This integration incolves service infrastructures, services offer and request protocols, and services selection techniques. In this article, we propose a new UAV-cloud architecture that enables UAVs to offer services allowing static as well as mobile users to request real-time and delay-tolerant UAV services using different communication technologies. This architecture comprises three layers. The middleware layer receives and processes requests from the end-user layer, then orchestrates activities where it plans missions and chooses from the infrastructure layer and the edge the appropriate UAV to satisfy consumer requests. The interaction between the different layers is made possible using two new protocols proposed to deal with the service request and consumption scenarios. Moreover, UAVs are highly extensible, and can advertise offers and receive requests in a centralized or distributed way by integrating a new module to their systems.",

      "abstract": "Random access channel (RACH) procedures in modern wireless communications are generally based on multi-channel slotted-ALOHA, which can be optimized by flexibly organizing devices' transmission and retransmission. However, due to the lack of information about the traffic generation statistics and the occurrence of random collision, optimizing RACH in an exact manner is generally challenging. In this article, we first summarize the general structure of optimization for different RACH schemes, and then review existing RACH optimization methods based on machine learning (ML) and non-ML techniques. We demonstrate that the ML-based methods can better optimize RACH schemes compared to non-ML-based methods due to their capability in solving high-complexity long-term optimization problems. To further improve the RACH performance, we introduce a decoupled learning strategy (DLS) for access control optimization, which individually executes two sub-tasks: traffic prediction and access control configuration. In detail, the traffic prediction relies on an online supervised learning method adopting recurrent neural networks that can accurately capture traffic statistics over consecutive frames, while the access control configuration uses either a non-ML-based controller or a cooperatively trained deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based controller selected depending on the complexity of different random access schemes. Numerical results show that the DLS optimizer considerably outperforms conventional DRL optimizers in terms of higher training efficiency and better access performance.",

      "abstract": "Crowded environments such as massive events are challenging for network infrastructure, as they involve many simultaneous offloading requests, heavy network traffic, and QoS-related issues. Designing smart solutions near the end users allows them to handle some of these requests, meet their QoS requirements, and reduce the load on the network infrastructure, which improves resource management. This article proposes a data management solution using multiple cooperative drones that fly close to the end users and provide advanced features as edge devices to store, handle, or forward data. A cloud server monitoring the area will predict users' behavior with the long short-term memory deep-learning-based model, and send a replication of the most requested data to the drones. Due to the limited storage capacity of drones, the replicated data is distributed between them based on location and computation load. In such systems that are managed by one entity, trust between the various components is highly important. Thus, all communications between the drones and the crowds are executed using smart contracts. The article highlights the benefits of the proposed model, as well as the emerging issues and challenges.",

      "abstract": "With the growing intelligence needed on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), seamless edge computing services for the sixth generation (6G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications require three-dimensional (3D) and ubiquitous networking coverage to realize the intensive computing tasks and data offloading. In the high mobility and fast-changing vehicular environment, the 6G V2X networks supporting vehicular edge computing (VEC) need to be more flexible, smart, and adaptive. In this article, an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted VEC system is envisioned to satisfy 6G V2X requirements and provide 3D and adaptive service coverage. We indicate that in 6G IoV networks, given the fast-changing and large-scale networks, effectively coordinating and managing massive UAVs incur several problems, which are complex to solve by conventional optimization tools. In this regard, leveraging the big data feature of historical information, artificial-intelligence-based solutions are anticipated to facilitate fast, automatic, and efficient UAV deployment to support 6G V2X applications. An illustrative case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent UAV-assisted VEC architecture. We also outline future research directions to realize the vision of UAV-assisted VEC for 6G IoV networks.",

In 6G PIoT, ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) can provide deterministic service guarantee for applications with stringent latency and reliability requirements. In recent years, the concept, use cases, and key technologies of URLLC have been thoroughly investigated by 3GPP, while the characteristics of PIoT are not considered in the standardization yet. Confronted with such a problem, this article analyzes the application scenarios and service requirements of URLLC for 6G PIoT, summarizes the key technologies and standardization of 5G/B5G URLLC and end-to-end URLLC guarantee technologies, and outlines the possible evolution directions of URLLC in 6G.",

As with all new technologies, especially one that offers rich operational flexibility, the lack of experience makes it vulnerable to potential misuse or malicious activities. As SDN becomes the technology of choice of network and service providers, it is imperative that careful attention is paid to the technology's vulnerability and proper mechanisms to protect SDN-based deployment environments. This article presents a classification of vulnerability challenges for SDN and discusses several solution strategies to address these challenges.",

      "abstract": "In September 2020, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) supplemented and updated a Business Review Letter (BRL) that it had issued to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE-SA) in 2015, upon a much-debated change made by IEEE-SA to its intellectual property rights (IPRs) policy. The DOJ took this extraordinary step by noting that its BRL had been mischaracterized both domestically and internationally. In this article, we review the evidence and find empirical support for DOJ's concerns. The BRL's only purpose was to state that the DOJ had no intention of bringing an antitrust enforcement action against the IEEE after reviewing the process followed by the organization during its updated IPR policy change. However, some industry groups and agencies cited the 2015 BRL to support a variety of propositions for broader principles around licensing of IPRs. In its update, the DOJ also correctly observes that some of the positions expressed in the BRL have become out of step with the most recent law and policy. Finally, we find empirical evidence supporting the DOJ's concerns that the predicted benefits of the IEEE-SA's 2015 patent policy revisions have not materialized.",

First, drawing on recent advances in machine learning and the availability of non-radio-frequency (RF) data, vision-aided wireless networks have been shown to significantly enhance wireless communication reliability without sacrificing spectral efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate how computer vision enables look-ahead prediction in a millimeter-wave channel blockage scenario before the blockage actually occurs. From a computer vision perspective, we highlight how RF-based sensing and imaging are instrumental in robustifying computer vision applications against occlusion and failure. This is corroborated via an RF-based image reconstruction use case, showcasing a receiver-side image failure correction resulting in reduced retransmission and latency. Taken together, this article sheds light on the much needed convergence of RF and non-RF modalities to enable ultra-reliable communication and truly intelligent 6G networks.",

To achieve long-range and low-power features of IoT networks, the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer functions in the previous WiFi standards are amended in the IEEE 802.11ah standard. In this article, the PHY and MAC technologies in IEEE 802.11ah are investigated, and the technical features are described by comparing it with other IoT systems. Additionally, a system on chip, which integrates a digital baseband, RF transceiver, analog-to-digital converter /digital-to-analog converter, processor, and memory with the external connection interface, is implemented. To verify the feasibility of long-range and low-power WiFi for IoT services, field tests in both indoor and outdoor environments are conducted. The power-save mode operation and power consumption are presented. Through various field tests and measured data, the feasibility of WiFi HaLow is verified as a long-range, high-throughput, and low-power IoT solution.",

Additionally, it can charge multiple devices close to the surface via power transfer enabled by a reconfigurable magnetic resonance layer. We develop a resonance coupling power distribution framework that allows flexible and on-demand power spots with power flow paths over 2D and 3D resonator surfaces to power RIS units and wirelessly charge devices. We design reconfigurable source and extender resonators and validate the iSurface prototype through simulation, experiments, and a real application demonstration. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of creating fully reconfigurable power spots with the deliverable power ranging from 0\u201316 W through different power flow paths and for different types of surfaces.",
