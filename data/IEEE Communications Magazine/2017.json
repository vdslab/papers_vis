   "abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive review of the principles and characteristics of 3D channel models. We propose a framework for a 3D channel extension of the widely used 2D 3GPP/ ITU generic channel model. We describe the main components and challenges of the newly proposed 3D channel model and the motivations that lie behind them. 3D channel models specify multipath elevation angles as well as azimuth (or horizontal plane) angles. This enables the evaluation of 3D MIMO techniques such as FD MIMO and per user 3D beamforming. We also provide a state-of-the-art review on the evolution of channel models. The article ends with a discussion on the impact of 3D channel modeling on system-level performance.",

   "abstract": "Ubiquitous information service converged by different types of heterogeneous networks is one of fundamental functions for smart cities. Considering the deployment of 5G ultra-dense wireless networks, 5G converged cell-less communication networks are proposed to support mobile terminals in smart cities. To break obstacles of heterogeneous wireless networks, the 5G converged cell-less communication network is vertically converged in different tiers of heterogeneous wireless networks and horizontally converged in celled architectures of base stations/ access points. Moreover, the software defined network controllers are configured to manage the traffic scheduling and resource allocation in 5G converged cell-less communication networks. Simulation results indicate the coverage probability and the energy saving at both base stations and mobile terminals are improved by the cooperative grouping scheme in 5G converged cell-less communication networks.",

   "abstract": "With the transition toward 5G, mobile cellular networks are evolving into a powerful platform for ubiquitous large-scale information acquisition, communication, storage, and processing. 5G will provide suitable services for mission-critical and real-time applications such as the ones envisioned in future smart grids. In this work, we show how the emerging 5G mobile cellular network, with its evolution of machine-type communications and the concept of mobile edge computing, provides an adequate environment for distributed monitoring and control tasks in smart grids. In particular, we present in detail how smart grids could benefit from advanced distributed state estimation methods placed within the 5G environment. We present an overview of emerging distributed state estimation solutions, focusing on those based on distributed optimization and probabilistic graphical models, and investigate their integration as part of the future 5G smart grid services.",

   "abstract": "Different from conventional mobile networks designed to optimize the transmission efficiency of one particular service (e.g., streaming voice/ video) primarily, the industry and academia are reaching an agreement that 5G mobile networks are projected to sustain manifold wireless requirements, including higher mobility, higher data rates, and lower latency. For this purpose, 3GPP has launched the standardization activity for the first phase 5G system in Release 15 named New Radio (NR). To fully understand this crucial technology, this article offers a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art development of NR, including deployment scenarios, numerologies, frame structure, new waveform, multiple access, initial/random access procedure, and enhanced carrier aggregation (CA) for resource requests and data transmissions. The provided insights thus facilitate knowledge of design and practice for further features of NR.",

   "abstract": "With the emergence of 5G mobile communication systems and software defined networks, not only could the performance of vehicular networks be improved, but also new applications of vehicular networks are required by future vehicles (e.g., pilotless vehicles). To meet requirements of intelligent transportation systems, a new vehicular network architecture integrated with 5G mobile communication technologies and software defined networking is proposed in this article. Moreover, fog cells have been proposed to flexibly cover vehicles and avoid frequent handover between vehicles and roadside units. Based on the proposed 5G software defined vehicular networks, the transmission delay and throughput are analyzed and compared. Simulation results indicate that there is a minimum transmission delay of 5G software defined vehicular networks considering different vehicle densities. Moreover, the throughput of fog cells in 5G software defined vehicular networks is better than the throughput of traditional transportation management systems.",

   "abstract": "5G requires a redesign of transport networks in order to feed the increasingly bandwidth hungry radio access networks and to benefit from the performance/cost efficiency provided by the integration of both backhaul and fronthaul segments over the same transport substrate as well as the incorporation of cloud RAN architectures. In addition, to increase its usage and cost efficiency, this new transport network should allow simultaneous use by different tenants (e.g. MVNOs, OTTs, and vertical industries). This article presents the 5G transport network architecture designed in the 5G-Crosshaul project to address this challenge. An SDN/NFV-based control plane has been designed that enables multi-tenancy through network slicing. The proposed solution allows for flexible and efficient allocation of transport network resources (networking and computing) to multiple tenants by leveraging on widespread architectural frameworks for NFV (ETSI NFV) and SDN (e.g., Open Daylight and ONOS).",

   "abstract": "The challenging requirements of 5G, from both the applications and architecture perspectives, motivate the need to explore the feasibility of delivering services over new network architectures. As 5G proposes application-centric network slicing, which enables the use of new data planes realizable over a programmable compute, storage, and transport infrastructure, we consider information- centric networking as a candidate network architecture to realize 5G objectives. This can coexist with end-to-end IP services that are offered today. To this effect, we first propose a 5G-ICN architecture and compare its benefits (i.e., innovative services offered by leveraging ICN features) to current 3GPP-based mobile architectures. We then introduce a general application-driven framework that emphasizes the flexibility afforded by network functions virtualization and software defined networking over which 5G-ICN can be realized. We specifically focus on the issue of how mobility as a service (MaaS) can be realized as a 5G-ICN slice, and give an in-depth overview on resource provisioning and inter-dependencies and coordination among functional 5G-ICN slices to meet the MaaS objectives. The article tries to show the flexibility of delivering services over ICN where virtualization of control and data plane can be used by applications to meet complex service logic execution while creating value to its end users.",

   "abstract": "With the progress of network technology in recent years, multimedia streaming applications have become increasingly popular. However, it is difficult to achieve quality of service and efficiency for multimedia streaming over vehicular networks because of the high mobility feature. Over the existing network architecture, it is difficult to immediately analyze the status of the entire network, and then establish the rules of allocation and management. However, the novel network architecture, software-defined networking, offers other options for making network management more efficient, especially for the 5G network environment. Hence, a buffer-aware streaming approach is proposed to allow users to play multimedia streaming over vehicular 5G networks, in the case of handover between different eNodeBs, to achieve minimum delay and have better quality of service. According to the user's mobility information, the status of the player buffer, and the current strength of the network signal, the proposed approach can provide the transmission strategy of multimedia streaming to the SDN controller. Finally, the experimental results proved that the proposed approach is able to not only adjust the priority of streaming content segments with the buffer and mobility status of user equipment to effectively retain overall streaming services quality, but also avoid the delay of streaming content transmission for 5G vehicular networks.",

The first three of these properties are easy to define. ROADM contention, however, can take on many forms, which has led to some misconceptions regarding the contentionless property.

   "abstract": "Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) represent an emerging paradigm encompassing the cyber world, physical world and social world. One of the main purposes of CPSSs is to provide high-quality, proactive, and personalized services for humans. For CPSSs to realize this purpose, a novel services framework is needed. In this article, we present a tensor-based cloud-edge computing framework that mainly includes the cloud and edge planes. The cloud plane is used to process large-scale, long-term, global data, which can be used to obtain decision making information such as the feature, law, or rule sets. The edge plane is used to process small-scale, short-term, local data, which is used to present the real-time situation. Also, personalized services will be directly provided for humans by the edge plane according to the obtained feature, law, or rule sets and the local high-quality data obtained in the edge plane. Then a tensor-based services model is proposed to match the requirement of users in the local CPSS. Finally, a case study about CPSS services is proposed to demonstrate the application features of the proposed framework.",

Network slicing offers an effective way to unlock the full potential of 5G networks and meet those requirements using a common network infrastructure. This article presents a cloud-native approach to network slicing that advances a fundamental rethinking of the mobile network to shift its architectural vision from a network of entities to a network of capabilities, and its driving purpose from a network for connectivity to a network for services. The approach covers the entire life cycle of network slices, encompassing their design, creation, deployment, customization, and optimization.

   "abstract": "The distributed Internet of Things is emerging in the literature as a new paradigm for IoT where remotely controlled smart objects can act on their own to sense/actuate, store, and interpret information either created by them or within the surrounding environment. This paradigm calls for novel security and access control mechanisms to enable smart objects with various resource limitations to evaluate a claimed access right from external entities without relying on central authorization systems. This article proposes utilizing a community-based structure to define the notion of access rights in a distributed IoT environment. With this structure, within a given community of smart objects sharing a common mission, access rights are to be evaluated based on the community norms by smart objects with sufficient resources on behalf of those with resource limitations. A novel, community-driven, access control framework is proposed in addition to a prototype to demonstrate access control granting in a user-friendly manner.",

   "abstract": "Charging management for EVs on the move has become an increasingly important research problem in smart cities. Major technical challenges include the selection of charging stations to guide charging plans, and the design of cost-efficient communication infrastructure between the power grid and EVs. In this article, we first present a brief review on state-of-the-art EV charging management schemes. Next, by incorporating battery switch technology to enable fast charging service, a publish/subscribe communication framework is provisioned to support the EV charging service. After that, we develop a fully distributed charging management scheme with consideration of urban travel uncertainties, for example, traffic congestion and drivers' preferences. This would benefit from low privacy sensitivity, as EVs' status information will not be released through management. Results demonstrate a guidance for the provisioning of a P/S communication framework to improve EV drivers' experience, for example, charging waiting time and total trip duration. Also, the benefit of a P/S communication framework is reflected in terms of the communication efficiency. Open research issues in this emerging area are also presented.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things has been applied in many fields, especially in smart cities. The failure of nodes brings a significant challenge to the robustness of topologies. The IoT of smart cities is increasingly producing a vast amount different types of data, which includes the node's geographic information, neighbor list, sensing data, and so on. Thus, how to improve the robustness of topology against malicious attacks based on big data of smart cities becomes a critical issue. To tackle this problem, this article proposes an approach to improve the robustness of network topology based on a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA). First, the geographic information and neighbor list of nodes are extracted from a big data server. Then a novel MPGA with a crossover operator and a mutation operator is proposed to optimize the robustness of topology. Our algorithm keeps the initial degree of each node unchanged such that the optimized topology will not increase the energy cost of adding edges. The extensive experiment results show that our algorithm can significantly improve the robustness of topologies against malicious attacks.",

   "abstract": "Opportunistic networks are envisioned to complement traditional infrastructure-based communication by allowing mobile devices to communicate directly with each other when in communication range instead of via the cellular network. Due to their design, opportunistic networks are considered to be an appropriate communication means in both urban scenarios where the cellular network is overloaded, as well as in scenarios where infrastructure is not available, such as in sparsely populated areas and during disasters. However, after a decade of research, opportunistic networks have not yet been ubiquitously deployed. In this article we explore the reasons for their absence. We take a step back, and first question whether the use cases that are traditionally conjured to motivate opportunistic networking research are still relevant. We also discuss emerging applications that leverage the presence of opportunistic connectivity. Further, we look at past and current technical issues, and we investigate how upcoming technologies would influence the opportunistic networking paradigm. Finally, we outline some future directions for researchers in the field of opportunistic networking.",

Fog computing brings computing, storage, and networking even closer to end users and devices for services with better QoS. We introduce FogOS, a fog computing architecture for IoT services. We take the perspective of designing an operating system, practicing the architectural lessons from the long history of operating systems. We focus on addressing the challenges raised by the diversity and heterogeneity of IoT services and edge devices that are owned by individuals and different owners, and presenting how FogOS is designed to effectively and efficiently provide and manage such IoT services.

   "abstract": "Supporting real-time and mobile data services, fog computing has been considered as a promising technology to overcome long and unpredicted delay in cloud computing. However, as resources in FNs are owned by independent users or infrastructure providers, the ADSSs cannot connect and access data services from the FNs directly, but can only request data service from the DSOs in the cloud. Accordingly, in fog computing, the DSOs are required to communicate with FNs and allocate resources from the FNs to the ADSSs. The DSOs provide virtualized data services to the ADSSs, and the FNs, motivated by the DSOs, provide data services in the physical network. Nevertheless, with fog computing added as the intermediate layer between the cloud and users, there are challenges such as the resource allocation in the virtualized network between the DSOs and ADSSs, the asymmetric information problem between DSOs and ADSSs, and the resource matching from the FNs to the ADSSs in the physical network. In this article, we propose a three-layer hierarchical game framework to solve the challenges in fog computing networks. In the proposed framework, we apply the Stackelberg sub-game for the interaction between DSOs and ADSSs, moral hazard modeling for the interaction between DSOs and FNs, and the student project allocation matching sub-game for the interaction between FNs and ADSSs. The purpose is to obtain stable and optimal utilities for each DSO, FN, and ADSS in a distributed fashion.",

   "abstract": "Due to the increasing usage and capabilities of smart devices, mobile application developers build a large number of resource intensive applications, such as WAR applications. Even with the rapid development in hardware technology, the computing capability and battery capacity on wearable devices and smartphones still cannot meet the application demands with heavy computations and high battery drain. Pervasive computing addresses this problem by migrating applications to the resource providers external to mobile devices. The profitability of this method heavily depends on how to implement it and when to use it. Although there are many computation offloading systems proposed in the literature, there is no practical manual that addresses all the implementation complexities on the way to building a general offloading system. In this article, we review developments in the field of pervasive computing on computation offloading. We use this literature review together with our own experience and provide designers with some detailed guidelines to gain a deep insight into the implementation challenges of a computation offloading system. The guidelines empower the reader to choose between the variety of solutions in the literature for developing any offloading system with the consideration of their own system architecture and available facilities. Finally, we evaluate our general offloading system on Android devices with two real-time applications.",

   "abstract": "A backpressure-based data collecting scheme has been applied in the Internet of Things, which can control the network congestion effectively and increase the network throughput. However, there is an obvious shortcoming in the traditional backpressure data collecting scheme for the network service chain. It attempts to search all possible paths between source node and destination node in the networks, causing an unnecessary long path for data collection, which results in large end-to-end delay and redundant energy consumption. To address this shortcoming of backpressure data collecting scheme in the Internet of Things, this article proposes an energy-aware and distance-aware data collecting scheme to enhance the lifetime of backpressure-based data collecting schemes. We propose an energy- and distance-based model that combines the factors of queue backlog, hop counts, and residual energy for making routing decisions. It not only reduces the unnecessary energy consumption, but also balances the residual energy. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme can reduce unnecessary energy consumption and end-to-end delay compared to the traditional and LIFO-based schemes. Meanwhile, it balances the energy of nodes and extends the lifetime of an Internet of Things.",

   "abstract": "This article addresses one of the key challenges of engaging a massive ad hoc crowd by providing sustainable incentives. The incentive model is based on a context-aware cyber-physical spatio-temporal serious game with the help of a mobile crowd sensing mechanism. To this end, this article describes a framework that can create an ad hoc social network of millions of people and provide context-aware serious-game services as an incentive. While interacting with different services, the massive crowd shares a rich trail of geo-tagged multimedia data, which acts as a crowdsourcing eco-system. The incentive model has been tested on the mass crowd at the Hajj since 2014. From our observations, we conclude that the framework provides a sustainable incentive mechanism that can solve many real-life problems such as reaching a person in a crowd within the shortest possible time, isolating significant events, finding lost individuals, handling emergency situations, helping pilgrims to perform ritual events based on location and time, and sharing geo-tagged multimedia resources among a community of interest within the crowd. The framework allows an ad hoc social network to be formed within a very large crowd, a community of interests to be created for each person, and information to be shared with the right community of interests. We present the communication paradigm of the framework, the serious game incentive model, and cloud-based massive geo-tagged social network architecture.",

   "abstract": "We propose a novel multiple access technique to overcome the shortcomings of the current proposals for the future releases of LTE. We provide a unified radio access system that efficiently and flexibly integrates both traditional cellular services and M2M connections arising from IoT applications. The proposed solution, referred to as MOMA, is based on establishing separate classes of users using relevant criteria that go beyond the simple handheld-IoT device split; service-dependent hierarchical spreading of the data signals; and a mix of multiuser and single-user detection schemes at the receiver. Signal spreading in MOMA allows densely connected devices with different QoS profiles to be handled, and at the same time its flexible receiver structure allows the receiver computational resources to be allocated to the connections that need them most. This yields scalable and efficient use of the available radio resources and better service integration. While providing significant advantages for key future communications scenarios, MOMA can be incorporated into LTE with a limited impact on the protocol structure and the signaling overhead.",

   "abstract": "Energy is one of the most valuable resources of the modern era and needs to be consumed in an optimized manner by an intelligent usage of various smart devices, which are major sources of energy consumption nowadays. With the popularity of low-voltage DC appliances such as-LEDs, computers, and laptops, there arises a need to design new solutions for self-sustainable smart energy buildings containing these appliances. These smart buildings constitute the next generation smart cities. Keeping focus on these points, this article proposes a cloud-assisted DC nanogrid for self-sustainable smart buildings in next generation smart cities. As there may be a large number of such smart buildings in different smart cities in the near future, a huge amount of data with respect to demand and generation of electricity is expected to be generated from all such buildings. This data would be of heterogeneous types as it would be generated from different types of appliances in these smart buildings. To handle this situation, we have used a cloudbased infrastructure to make intelligent decisions with respect to the energy usage of various appliances. This results in an uninterrupted DC power supply to all low-voltage DC appliances with minimal dependence on the grid. Hence, the extra burden on the main grid in peak hours is reduced as buildings in smart cities would be self-sustainable with respect to their energy demands. In the proposed solution, a collection of smart buildings in a smart city is taken for experimental study controlled by different data centers managed by different utilities. These data centers are used to generate regular alerts on the excessive usage of energy from the end users' appliances. All such data centers across different smart cities are connected to the cloud-based infrastructure, which is the overall manager for making all the decisions about energy automation in smart cities. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated with respect to various performance evaluation metrics such as satisfaction ratio, delay incurred, overhead generated, and demand-supply gap. With respect to these metrics, the performance of the proposed scheme is found to be good for implementation in a realworld scenario.",

   "abstract": "Connected vehicles provide advanced transformations and attractive business opportunities in the automotive industry. Presently, IEEE 802.11p and evolving 5G are the mainstream radio access technologies in the vehicular industry, but neither of them can meet all requirements of vehicle communication. In order to provide low-latency and high-reliability communication, an SDN-enabled network architecture assisted by MEC, which integrates different types of access technologies, is proposed. MEC technology with its on-premises feature can decrease data transmission time and enhance quality of user experience in latency-sensitive applications. Therefore, MEC plays as important a role in the proposed architecture as SDN technology. The proposed architecture was validated by a practical use case, and the obtained results have shown that it meets application- specific requirements and maintains good scalability and responsiveness.",

   "abstract": "In wireless ad hoc networks, each node participates in routing by forwarding data to other nodes without a pre-existing infrastructure. Particularly, with the wide adoption of smart devices, the concept of smartphone ad hoc networks (SPANs) has evolved to enable alternate means for information sharing. Using unlicensed frequency spectrum and short-range wireless technologies, a SPAN enables a new paradigm of applications and thus is seen as an attractive component in future wireless networks. In a SPAN, smartphones form local peer-to-peer networks to cooperate and share information efficiently. Recent studies have shown that if the users' social relations are considered while designing cooperation schemes and protocols in SPANs, the cooperation initialization and content dissemination can be notably improved to increase the overall network efficiency and communications reliability. In this article, we present a social-aware framework for optimizing SPANs by exploiting two layers: users' relationships in the online social network layer and users' offline connections and interactions in the physical wireless network layer. The online content popularity distribution is also studied as a result of the users' online interaction profiles. In the end, we integrate both online and offline layers, and discuss possible applications to further enhance the network performance.",

   "abstract": "The modernization of urban scenarios includes improvements in wireless communication and efficient content dissemination to citizens. In these scenarios, the demographic densification and the phenomenon of popularization of mobile devices may characterize massive demands for online content in crowded regions, able to temporarily deplete the resources of the network infrastructure. To address this challenge, the next generation of wireless networks envision local cooperation among users using the D2D paradigm to improve content retrieval. Much effort has been dedicated to proposing mechanisms for cooperation and resource sharing; however, the advantages of big data have been little explored to support D2D to cope with urban and social dynamics. In this article, we investigate human mobility using data from online social networks, observing the mobility of 362,000 users during one year in New York City. We analyze the spatiotemporal features of the city, and their effects on encounters between users and content dissemination through D2D. Thus, we propose a framework for distributed caching based on social and spatiotemporal factors. The results of the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of D2D to offload the network demand and performance gain in the provision of content opportunistically.",

   "abstract": "EVs provide a promising green solution to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and the emission of greenhouse gas. This article concerns hybrid EV systems that contain both wired charging and wireless charging vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discuss how to jointly use these two types of charging methods whose advantages are complementary to each other; for example, wireless charging has better user friendliness and flexibility, while wired charging can provide higher charging efficiency and bidirectional energy transmission. We believe such a hybrid system can benefit us much more than either a pure wireless or pure wired EV charging system. On the other hand, we also pay attention to a practically important problem with DSM. The existing schemes can hardly ensure efficient and stable charging services in the foreseeable future due to the rapidly increasing number of electric vehicles and the limited capacity of local grids. To address this issue, we propose a software-defined green framework for hybrid EV charging networks, which consists of three planes: the application plane provides customized services for users; the control plane aims to guide both data flow and energy flow to implement an efficient and economic strategy for EV charging; and the physical plane collects the information from a large number of EVs and other infrastructures. Furthermore, we present a DSM approach for EV charging as a case study. Simulation results reveal that our proposals could achieve delightful DSM performance in the proposed software-defined EV charging networks. Although the proposed hybrid framework offers promising opportunities, we still face some technical challenges that solicit further research efforts from both academia and industry, which are discussed in detail at the end of this article.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we present a survey of recent advances in passive human behavior recognition in indoor areas using the channel state information (CSI) of commercial WiFi systems. The movement of the human body parts cause changes in the wireless signal reflections, which result in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behavior can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performance; however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networking (RNN) and show the improved performance. We also discuss different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and the multi-user scenario; and finally suggest possible directions for future work.",

   "abstract": "Despite several decades of intense developments, the consumer IoT market still falls short of delivering its original economic promise. Its current condition -- featuring fragmentation among the key players and their siloed business models -- is comprehensively reviewed in this article. We specifically address the stagnant home automation sector, which suffers from a lack of interoperability between the existing IoT products. Aiming to unblock its sustainable growth, we systematically report on the development of a next-generation SyMPHOnY platform that becomes the key asset for telecom operators willing to understand the true needs of their customers. Supported by a recent user experience study, our SyMPHOnY platform pragmatically integrates a residential gateway module with a multitude of smart home solutions to provide valuable information and services based on consumers' household automation data. It thus offers significant promise to bridge the existing divide between IoT technology availability and its slow market adoption.",

   "abstract": "Nowadays, the study of underwater WSNs (UWSNs) has become a hot topic. However, UWSNs have not been fully utilized in the complex underwater environment, since there are some difficulties in controlling mobile sensor nodes and underwater environment conditions. In addition, how to ensure the security of UWSNs and the safety of underwater mobile sensor nodes has not been solved well. In this article, we study the problem of trust establishment between nodes in UWSNs. We first give a detailed overview of existing trust management mechanisms. Since UWSNs possess specific characteristics, it is noted that those existing mechanisms are not applicable for UWSNs. We then introduce a trust cloud model that is suitable for trust management in UWSNs.",

   "abstract": "Spectrum is limited, but the demand for it is growing steadily with new users, applications, and services in both commercial and tactical communications. The current paradigm of static spectrum allocation cannot satisfy this demand, resulting in a congested, contested environment with poor spectrum efficiency. Tactical radios need to share spectrum with other in- and out-of-network tactical and commercial radios, subject to potential jamming and other security attacks. Cognitive radio provides tactical communications with new means of spectrum sharing, cohabitation configurability, and adaptation to improve communication rates, connectivity, robustness, and situational awareness, all translated to network- centric mission success. A systematic solution to SDR programming and test and evaluation (T&amp;E) is needed to address spectrum challenges with the network-centric mission success set as the primary goal. Once equipped with cognitive radio capabilities, tactical radios can quickly and reliably discover the white-space and effectively use spectrum opportunities across time, space, and frequency. This article presents the design and implementation of a visual and modular radio software programming tool that supports easy, fast, and radio-agnostic development of cognitive radio and network protocols and security mechanisms. This tool is fully integrated with a unified T&amp;E framework that applies the same SDR solution to high fidelity simulation and emulation tests under a common, controllable, and repeatable scenario. This unified approach makes prototyping of cognitive radio capabilities with tactical radios faster, easier, and cost-effective.",

   "abstract": "The increasing urbanization level of the world population has driven the development of a smart city geographic system, conceived as a fully connected wide area characterized by the presence of a multitude of smart devices, sensors, and processing nodes aimed at distributing intelligence into the city. At the same time, the pervasiveness of wireless technologies has led to the presence of heterogeneous networks, operating simultaneously in the same city area. One of the main challenges in this context is to provide sustainable solutions able to jointly optimize the data transfer, exploiting heterogeneous networks, and the data processing, exploiting heterogeneous devices, for managing smart city applications for citizens' communities. In this article, the UMCC framework is developed, introducing a mobile cloud computing model describing the flows of data and operations taking place in the smart city. In particular, we focus on the proposal of a unified offloading mechanism where communication and computing resources are jointly managed, allowing load balancing among the different entities in the environment, delegating both communication and computation tasks in order to satisfy the smart city application requirements. This allows us to cope with the limited battery power and computation capacity of smart mobile devices and plays a key role in a smart environment where wireless communication is of utmost relevance, particularly in the mobility and traffic control domains.",

   "abstract": "This article presents our work proposing in-network caching in IP-based networks by adding a content identifier into a newly defined IPv6 extension header, where the new architecture is named CAIP. CAIP abandons the complicated name-based forwarding table in ICN, and instead integrates IP routing lookup with cache index lookup, which is compatible with the IP network and also inherits the proven advantages of ICN. Cache index exchanging and cooperative caching are implemented between one-hop CAIP enabled neighboring routers, which is simple but efficient. Moreover, for per-chunk caching, as an extension, bitmap is introduced to merge multiple request packets into one. Performance analysis shows that CAIP gains significant performance improvement in terms of access delay and traffic load.",

   "abstract": "IP address resources work as basic elements for providing broadband network services. However, the increase in number, diversity and complexity of modern network devices and services creates unprecedented challenges for current manual IP address management. Manually maintaining IP address resources could always be sub-optimal for IP resource utilization. Besides, it requires heavy human efforts from network operators. To achieve high utilization and flexible scheduling of IP network address resources, this article introduces APRIM, an innovative SDNbased IP address pooling and intelligent management system, in which we design a centralized address management system to realize dynamic allocation, reclaim, and reallocation of address blocks for the current BRAS/vBRAS deployment. We developed a prototype system and evaluated the system based on real-world networks and users in two provinces from China Telecom. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can largely improve the address utilization efficiently and reduce the network resource maintenance workload.",

   "abstract": "Spectrum management needs to be effective, in that spectrum must be allocated to the right uses, and efficient, in that spectrum must be assigned to those that value it the most. Technological advances and demands for further spectrum availability from mobile broadband operators (among others) require spectrum management to promptly and firmly incorporate schemes to increase the technical efficiency of spectrum utilization. One such scheme is spectrum sharing, which has the potential to result in higher spectrum utilization and greater spectrum value. In such context allocation and assignment, two critical functions to manage the spectrum are also discussed. By means of tutorial-styled presentation of spectrum sharing techniques and policy decisions, this article argues that in the course of deciding about allocation and assignment of spectrum, a spectrum authority can and should include market-based mechanisms that incentivize incumbents to share spectrum needed by entrants.",

In the UDHN, the base station is brought closer and closer to users through densely deploying small cells, which results in extremely high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. In this article, we first present a potential network architecture for the UDHN, and then propose a generalized orthogonal/non-orthogonal random access scheme to improve the network efficiency while reducing the signaling overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, we present some of the key challenges of the UDHN.",

Systems that make use of the mmWave bands above 10 GHz -where large regions of spectrum are available -are a promising 5G candidate that may be able to rise to the occasion. However, although the mmWave bands can support massive peak data rates, delivering these data rates for end-to-end services while maintaining reliability and ultra-low-latency performance to support emerging applications and use cases will require rethinking all layers of the protocol stack.

   "abstract": "It is often said that the Internet is ubiquitous in our daily lives, but this holds true only for those who can easily access it. In fact, billions of people are still digitally disconnected, as bringing connectivity to certain zones does not make a good business case. The only solution for these unsatisfied potential users is to directly undertake the building of the infrastructure required to obtaining access to the Internet, typically forming groups in order to share the corresponding cost. This article presents a global classification and a summary of the main characteristics of different Alternative Network deployments that have arisen in recent years with an aim to provide Internet services in places where mainstream network deployments do not exist or are not adequate solutions. The \"Global Access to the Internet for All\" Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force, where all authors actively participate, is interested in documenting these emerging deployments. As an outcome of this work, a classification has converged by consensus, where five criteria have been identified and, based on them, four different types of Alternative Networks have been identified and described with real-world examples. Such a classification is useful for a deeper understanding of the common characteristics behind existing and emerging Alternative Networks.",

   "abstract": "In warm shallow waters, the ambient noise process is found to be impulsive. This phenomenon is attributed to the collective snaps created by snapping shrimp colonies inhabiting such regions. Each snap essentially creates a pressure wave, and the resulting noise process dominates the acoustic spectrum at medium-to-high frequencies. Consequently, if not addressed, snapping shrimp noise is severely detrimental to the performance of an acoustic communication system operating nearby. This article briefly summarizes and addresses the problems faced during acoustic communication in snapping shrimp noise. We discuss how the noise process can be characterized by a certain statistical model based on the symmetric a-stable (SaS) family of distributions. Within the framework of this model, we highlight problems and the corresponding solutions faced in various stages of digital communication system design. Both single and multicarrier systems are commented on. The resulting schemes are robust to outliers and offer excellent error performance in comparison to conventional methods in impulsive noise.",

   "abstract": "With the recent advances in the telecommunications and auto industries, we have witnessed growing interest in ITS, of which VANETs are an essential component. SDN can bring advantages to ITS through its ability to provide flexibility and programmability to networks through a logically centralized controller entity that has a comprehensive view of the network. However, as the SDN paradigm initially had fixed networks in mind, adapting it to work on VANETs requires some changes to address particular characteristics of this kind of scenario, such as the high mobility of its nodes. There has been initial work on bringing SDN concepts to vehicular networks to expand its abilities to provide applications and services through the increased flexibility, but most of these studies do not directly tackle the issue of loss of connectivity with said controller entity. In this article, we propose a hierarchical SDN-based vehicular architecture that aims to have improved performance in the situation of loss of connection with the central SDN controller. Simulation results show that our proposal outperforms traditional routing protocols in the scenario where there is no coordination from the central SDN controller.",

Indeed, in its final deliverable, the European 5G project METIS identifies massive MIMO as a key 5G enabler and proposes specific technology components that will allow the cost-efficient deployment of cellular systems taking advantage of hundreds of antennas at cellular base stations. These technology components include handling the inherent pilot-data resource allocation trade-off in a near optimal fashion, a novel random access scheme supporting a large number of users, coded channel state information for sparse channels in frequency- division duplexing systems, managing user grouping and multi-user beamforming, and a decentralized coordinated transceiver design. The aggregate effect of these components enables massive MIMO to contribute to the METIS objectives of delivering very high data rates and managing dense populations.",

   "abstract": "Predictions indicate that mobile video streams will dominate mobile traffic in the near future. Heterogeneous UDN is a promising technique for 5G mobile networks. This technique offers high access speeds for video watchers through the dense deployment of small cells. However, the backhaul of a UDN will become a bottleneck with the rapid increase in mobile video traffic. Additionally, the considerable video traffic generated from and to UDNs induces significant stress on the core network of a 5G network. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the distribution of video content for 5G UDNs. Multicasting is considered to be a good communication method for distributing video content. This article examines a video multicast orchestration scheme based on SDN, named HCM, for 5G UDNs. To adapt well to a heterogeneous UDN environment in 5G networks and effectively save spectrum resources, HCM implements wireless multicast functionality based on a common unicast channel. HCM performs concurrent multicasting to clearly reduce the bandwidth consumption of a 5G network, particularly the backhaul, and further controls video traffic passed through the backhaul using a traffic-aware method. During the packet loss recovery of HCM, SDN-based elastic area multicast is used to more effectively retransmit recovered packets. The experimental results indicate that our proposed scheme can distribute video content with high effectiveness.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, the number of attacks and threat vectors against enterprise networks have been constantly increasing in numbers and variety. Despite these attacks, the main security systems, for example network firewalls, have remained rather unchanged. In addition, new challenges arise not only to the level of provided security, but also to the scalability and manageability of the deployed countermeasures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Due to the tight integration into the physical network's infrastructure, a dynamic resource allocation to adapt the security measures to the current network conditions is a difficult undertaking. This article covers different architectural design patterns for the integration of SDN/NFV-based security solutions into enterprise networks.",

   "abstract": "This article discusses FEC schemes for next generation 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s Ethernet being defined by IEEE P802.3bs. Performance, latency, and complexity are analyzed by developing application-specific error models. The 200GbE and 400GbE consists of optical and electrical link segments. Therefore, FEC needs to overcome error floor caused by optical modules as well as burst errors of electrical links. Various interleaving schemes, including FEC orthogonal multiplexing (FOM) and FEC pre-interleaving schemes, are proposed to achieve link efficiency and solve deployment issues. For the first time, FEC interleaving schemes are determined to be included in IEEE P802.3 standards.",

The key feature of NOMA is to serve multiple users at the same time/frequency/ code, but with different power levels, which yields a significant spectral efficiency gain over conventional orthogonal MA. The article provides a systematic treatment of this newly emerging technology, from its combination with MIMO technologies to cooperative NOMA, as well as the interplay between NOMA and cognitive radio. This article also reviews the state of the art in the standardization activities concerning the implementation of NOMA in LTE and 5G networks.",

   "abstract": "Massive machine type communication (mMTC) to serve billions of IoT devices is considered to offer the potential to open a potential new market for the next generation cellular network. Legacy cellular networks cannot meet the requirements of emerging mMTC applications, since they were designed for human-driven services. In order to provide support for mMTC services, current research and standardization work focuses on the improvement and adaptation of legacy networks. However, these solutions face challenges to enhance the service availability and improve the battery life of mMTC devices simultaneously. In this article, we propose to exploit a network controlled sidelink communication scheme to enable cellular networks with better support for mMTC services. Moreover, a context-aware algorithm is applied to ensure the efficiency of the proposed scheme and multiple context information of devices are taken into account. Correspondingly, signaling schemes are also designed and illustrated in this work to facilitate the proposed technology. The signaling schemes enable the network to collect required context information with light signaling effort and thus the network can derive a smart configuration for both the sidelink and cellular link. In order to demonstrate the improvements brought by our scheme, a system-level simulator is implemented and numerical results show that our scheme can simultaneously enhance both the service availability and battery life of sensors.",

   "abstract": "There has been a tremendous increase in the amount of user generated content (UGC), and many mobile devices are also equipped with sensors (magnetic compass, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.). We present an automatic video remixing system (AVRS), which intelligently processes UGC in combination with sensor information. The system aims to generate a video remix with minimal user effort. We present sensor-based as well as sensor-less architectures of such a system. The sensor-based AVRS system involves certain architectural choices that meet the key system requirements (leverage user generated content, use sensor information, reduce end-user burden) and user experience requirements. Architecture adaptations are required if any of the operating parameters need to be constrained for real world deployment feasibility. We present sensor-less architecture adaptations that enable the usage of the automatic remixing logic in different operating scenarios. The challenge for these system adaptations is to improve the benefits for certain key performance parameters, while reducing the compromise for other parameters. Subsequently, two key sensor-less AVRS architecture adaptations (Cloud Remix System and Smartview system) are presented. We show that significant reduction in system complexity can be achieved when a smaller reduction in the user experience is allowed. Similarly, the system can also be optimized to reduce the need for other key requirement parameters such as storage and user density.",

   "abstract": "Connecting a massive number of sensors and actuators with energy and transmission constraints is only possible by providing a reliable connection despite the increase in data traffic due to the Internet of Things, and by guaranteeing a maximum end-to-end delay for applications with real-time constraints. Next generation network architectures need to satisfy these two requirements while connecting IoT sources producing data at massive scales to cloud resources that provide the capability to process and store this data. For this reason, realization of IoT in next generation cellular networks faces the problem of delivering cloud services over the network to things that are placed anywhere. In this study, we explain how the technologies envisioned for next generation networks can respond to the challenge of realizing IoT over a use case prepared for the IoT smart home platform called IOLITE. We start by discussing capacity requirements and focus on network densification as a promising solution method. The challenges of network densification can be overcome by integrating the technological enablers such as SDN, C-RAN, SON, and mobile edge computing. For this reason, we provide a thorough survey on the state of the art in integrating these enablers for a flexible network architecture at all network segments. Finally, we discuss how the needs of the IOLITE community use case scenario can be satisfied by implementing a service- centric abstraction layer on top of a flexible infrastructure for beyond 5G IoT applications.",

   "abstract": "The huge amount of data generated by devices, vehicles, buildings, the power grid, and many other connected things, coupled with increased rates of data transmission, constitute the big data challenge. Among many areas associated with the Internet of Things, smart grid and electric vehilces have their share of this challenge by being both producers and consumers (ie., prosumers) of big data. Electric vehicls can significantly help smart cities to become greener by reducing emissions of the transportation sector and play an important role in green smart cities. In this article, we first survey the data analytics techniques used for handling the big data of smart grid and electric vehicles. The data generated by electric vehicles come from sources that vary from sensors to trip logs. Once this vast amount of data are analyzed using big data techniques, they can be used to develop policies for siting charging stations, developing smart charging algorithms, solving energy efficiency issues, evaluating the capacity of power distribution systems to handle extra charging loads, and finally, determining the market value for the services provided by electric vehicles (i.e., vehicle-to-grid opportunities). This article provides a comprehensive overview of the data analytics landscape on the electric vehicle integration to green smart cities. It serves as a roadmap to the future data analytics needs and solutions for electric vehicle integration to smart cities.",

Big data capability thus available throughout such networks will not only deliver enhanced system performance, but also profoundly impact the design and standardization of the next-generation network architecture, protocol stack, signaling procedure, and physical- layer processing. In this article, a mobile network architecture enabled by big data analytics is proposed, which is capable of efficient resource orchestration, content distribution, and radio access network optimization. The protocol stack configuration at each access point and the processing optimization of each layer are presented. Key physical layer designs including reference signals and frame structure are discussed. Moreover, utilizing signals in the transform domains, such as delay, Doppler, and angle, may bring enlarged coherence time of the effective channels. It enables much simpler physical layer design, and effectively bridges the latency gap between big data cloud computing and real-time network optimization.",

   "abstract": "This article argues that a big data network joint SDN, together with cloud and fog computing platforms, can build a service chain network. In SDN, the purpose is to reduce a large amount of redundant data and response time. We propose a novel Big Data Orchestration as a Service (BDOaaS) as the networking framework, which can dynamically orchestrate big data into services in SDN. In BDOaaS networking, the data center distributes software to all devices in the distributed network, which can orchestrate big data into services in the distributed network; the services- oriented network model is formed. Thus, the network load and response time is reduced. The BDOaaS framework and various components of BDOaaS as well as operation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed BDOaaS framework. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges in implementing the proposed framework in next generation networks.",

   "abstract": "We envision a world in which everyday life experiences can be augmented on-demand via the real-time cloud processing of information sourced at multiple wireless end points. While current wireless systems focus their effort on improving downlink capacity, these life-changing augmented experiences will only become a reality if the uplink capacity increases at the same or even higher rate. As a catalyzer for the capacity increase in both directions of the wireless communication link, we propose an innovative idea that brings the spectral and energy efficiency benefits of massive MIMO systems directly to the end user without compromising device size, weight, or power consumption. We propose a radio enhanced garment composed of blended textile antennas for seamless high data rate connectivity anytime, anywhere, addressing immediate and future needs. The real-world applications for such a solution are tremendous, including enhanced connectivity in crowded spaces and remote areas, as well as symmetric extremely high data rates for access to next generation real-time services (e.g., augmented reality and cognition, real-time computer vision, telepresence, 3D video sharing) from ever lighter end user devices (e.g., Google Glass).",

   "abstract": "Interconnected smart vehicles offer a range of sophisticated services that benefit the vehicle owners, transport authorities, car manufacturers, and other service providers. This potentially exposes smart vehicles to a range of security and privacy threats such as location tracking or remote hijacking of the vehicle. In this article, we argue that blockchain (BC), a disruptive technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrencies to smart contracts, is a potential solution to these challenges. We propose a BC-based architecture to protect the privacy of users and to increase the security of the vehicular ecosystem. Wireless remote software updates and other emerging services such as dynamic vehicle insurance fees are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed security architecture. We also qualitatively argue the resilience of the architecture against common security attacks.",

   "abstract": "Nowadays, at least two billion people are experiencing a complete lack of wireless cellular network coverage. These users live in rural areas and low-income regions, where network operators are not keen to invest, mainly due to high capital expenditure and operational expenditure costs, as well as the scarcity of electricity from the grid. We tackle this challenge by proposing a 5G network explicitly designed to serve rural and low-income areas. Our solution investigates the possibility of mounting remote radio heads on top of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as large cells (LCs) to increase the coverage range. In addition, 5G nodes are powered by solar panels and batteries. Preliminary results, obtained over three representative case studies located in Italy, Cook Islands, and Zimbabwe, show that providing connectivity in rural and low-income areas by means of the proposed 5G architecture is feasible. At the same time, we also show that the monthly subscription fee paid by the users can be kept sufficiently low, that is, less than \u20ac1/month in low-income areas, and around \u20ac11/month in rural regions.",

   "abstract": "The virtually unlimited available resources and wide range of services provided by the cloud have resulted in the emergence of new cloud-based applications, such as smart grids, smart building control, and virtual reality. These developments, however, have also been accompanied by a problem for delay-sensitive applications that have stringent delay requirements. The current cloud computing paradigm cannot realize the requirements of mobility support, location awareness, and low latency. Hence, to address the problem, an edge computing paradigm that aims to extend the cloud resources and services and enable them to be nearer the edge of an enterprise's network has been introduced. In this article, we highlight the significance of edge computing by providing real-life scenarios that have strict constraint requirements on application response time. From the previous literature, we devise a taxonomy to classify the current research efforts in the domain of edge computing. We also discuss the key requirements that enable edge computing. Finally, current challenges in realizing the vision of edge computing are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Relay transmissions can help improve system coverage and throughput, and hence information- theoretic analysis of relay channels has been at the forefront of research for decades. While providing powerful results, information-theoretic studies generally assume no buffer at the relay, and the performance is limited by the worst conditions of the transmitting and receiving channels of the relay. Recently, it has been shown that the achievable throughput can be significantly improved with the introduction of a buffer-aided relay model. Specifically, buffer-aided relaying can provide significant gains in terms of throughput, diversity, and signal-to-noise ratio without delay constraints. This article considers buffer-aided relay systems under delay constraints specified by limitations on delay violation probability. The necessary research tools and several results on different relay networks including two-hop and three-node relay channels are discussed. Certain challenges associated with buffer-aided relaying under delay constraints and topics for future research are outlined.",

   "abstract": "Smart and connected devices can improve industrial processes, and generate new and better services. While this premise is well understood within the ICT industry, there is a challenge in extending this knowledge to vertical industries. The potential of the Internet of Things lies in the interaction among industries working together toward value co-creation. Firms need to look beyond their internal business models and explore cooperative perspectives to define new business opportunities. In this article, we look into the relevance of vertical cooperation in the area of IoT and highlight the need to develop new value networks that leverage this cooperation and enable the creation of new business models. To lead our discussions, we use the examples of two major building blocks of smart cities: intelligent transport systems and health and well being services based on connected devices and solutions.",

   "abstract": "Smart home is an emerging area that opens up a diverse set of downstream applications, such as dynamic pricing and demand response techniques, whose goals are typically to lower power consumption while providing comfortable and convenient services. Smart home has been extensively studied, and shown to be beneficial in people's real lives. Although useful, typical smart home platforms work at the \"servant\" level - highly dependent on user inputs with no predictions of human demands - which, if well addressed, would significantly widen their applicability. In this article, we propose a human-centric smart home energy management system (SHE) that works at the \"butler\" level. The system integrates ubiquitous sensing data from the physical and cyber spaces to discover the patterns of power usage and cognitively understand the behaviors of human beings. The relationship between them is established to dynamically infer users' demands for electricity, and then the optimal scheduling of the home energy system is triggered to respond to both the users' demands and electricity rates. Based on the novel framework, our SHE system provides intelligent services to satisfy the requirements of users as a butler - aiming not only to save the electricity cost or reduce the peak load, but also to predict users' demands and managing \"servants\".",

   "abstract": "People's interaction with IoT devices such as proximity beacons, body-worn sensors, and controllable light bulbs is often mediated through personal mobile devices. Current approaches usually make applications operate in separate silos, as the functionality of IoT devices is fixed by vendors and typically accessed only through low-level proprietary APIs. This limits the flexibility in designing applications and requires intense wireless interactions, which may impact energy consumption. COIN is a system architecture that breaks this separation by allowing developers to flexibly run a slice of a mobile app's logic onto IoT devices. Mobile apps can dynamically deploy arbitrary tasks implemented as loosely coupled components. The underlying runtime support takes care of the coordination across tasks and of their real-time scheduling. Our prototype indicates that COIN both enables increased flexibility and improves energy efficiency at the IoT device, compared to traditional architectures.",

   "abstract": "Our society increasingly relies on web-based services like online banking, shopping, and socializing. Many of these services heavily depend on secure end-to-end transactions to transfer personal, financial, and other sensitive information. At the core of ensuring secure transactions are the HTTPS protocol and the \"trust\" relationships between many involved parties, including users, browsers, servers, domain owners, and the third-party CAs that issue certificates binding ownership of public keys with servers and domains. This article presents an overview of the current trust landscape and provides statistics to illustrate and quantify some of the risks facing typical users. Using measurement results obtained through passive monitoring of the HTTPS traffic between a campus network and the Internet, we provide concrete examples and characterize the certificate usage and trust relationships in this complex landscape. By comparing our observations against known vulnerabilities and problems, we highlight and discuss the actual security that typical Internet users (e.g., the people on campus) experience. Our measurements cover both mobile and stationary users, consider the involved trust relationships, and provide insights into how the HTTPS protocol is used and the weaknesses observed in practice. While the security properties vary significantly between sessions, out of the 232 million HTTPS sessions we observed, more than 25 percent had weak security properties.",

   "abstract": "Fog computing is an end-to-end horizontal architecture that distributes computing, storage, control, and networking functions closer to users along the cloud-to-thing continuum. The word \u201cedge\u201d may carry different meanings. A common usage of the term refers to the edge network as opposed to the core network, with equipment such as edge routers, base stations, and home gateways. In that sense, there are several differences between fog and edge. First, fog is inclusive of cloud, core, metro, edge, clients, and things. The fog architecture will further enable pooling, orchestrating, managing, and securing the resources and functions distributed in the cloud, anywhere along the cloud-to-thing continuum, and on the things to support end-to-end services and applications. Second, fog seeks to realize a seamless continuum of computing services from the cloud to the things rather than treating the network edges as isolated computing platforms. Third, fog envisions a horizontal platform that will support the common fog computing functions for multiple industries and application domains, including but not limited to traditional telco services. Fourth, a dominant part of edge is mobile edge, whereas the fog computing architecture will be flexible enough to work over wireline as well as wireless networks.",

   "abstract": "One of the major goals of the 5G technology roadmap is to create disruptive innovation for the efficient use of the radio spectrum to enable rapid access to bandwidth-intensive multimedia services over wireless networks. The biggest challenge toward this goal lies in the difficulty in exploiting the multicast nature of the wireless channel in the presence of wireless users that rarely access the same content at the same time. Recently, the combined use of wireless edge caching and coded multicasting has been shown to be a promising approach to simultaneously serve multiple unicast demands via coded multicast transmissions, leading to order-of-magnitude bandwidth efficiency gains. However, a crucial open question is how these theoretically proven throughput gains translate in the context of a practical implementation that accounts for all the required coding and protocol overheads. In this article, we first provide an overview of the emerging caching- aided coded multicast technique, including state-of-the-art schemes and their theoretical performance. We then focus on the most competitive scheme proposed to date and describe a fully working prototype implementation in CorteXlab, one of the few experimental facilities where wireless multiuser communication scenarios can be evaluated in a reproducible environment. We use our prototype implementation to evaluate the experimental performance of state-of-the-art caching-aided coded multicast schemes compared to state-of-the-art uncoded schemes, with special focus on the impact of coding computation and communication overhead on the overall bandwidth efficiency performance. Our experimental results show that coding overhead does not significantly affect the promising performance gains of coded multicasting in small-scale realworld scenarios, practically validating its potential to become a key next generation 5G technology.",

We demonstrate the transformational role of coding in fog computing for leveraging such redundancy to substantially reduce the bandwidth consumption and latency of computing. In particular, we discuss two recently proposed coding concepts, minimum bandwidth codes and minimum latency codes, and illustrate their impacts on fog computing. We also review a unified coding framework that includes the above two coding techniques as special cases, and enables a trade-off between computation latency and communication load to optimize system performance. At the end, we will discuss several open problems and future research directions.",

MEC servers are deployed on a generic computing platform within the RAN, and allow for delay-sensitive and context-aware applications to be executed in close proximity to end users. This paradigm alleviates the backhaul and core network and is crucial for enabling low-latency, high-bandwidth, and agile mobile services. This article envisions a real-time, context-aware collaboration framework that lies at the edge of the RAN, comprising MEC servers and mobile devices, and amalgamates the heterogeneous resources at the edge. Specifically, we introduce and study three representative use cases ranging from mobile edge orchestration, collaborative caching and processing, and multi-layer interference cancellation. We demonstrate the promising benefits of the proposed approaches in facilitating the evolution to 5G networks. Finally, we discuss the key technical challenges and open research issues that need to be addressed in order to efficiently integrate MEC into the 5G ecosystem.",

   "abstract": "Network-centric warfare is a no-way-back trend in modern military operations. The application of this concept ranges from upper-level decision making echelons to troop guidance on the battlefield, and many studies have been carried out in this area. However, most of these are concerned with either the higher-level strategic networks, that is, the networks linking the higher echelons with abundant resources, satellite communications, or even a whole network infrastructure, or high-end TEN, representing resource-rich troops in the field, with military aircraft, battleships, or ground vehicles equipped with powerful wireless communication devices and (almost) unrestricted energy resources for communication. However, these studies fail to take into account the \"last-mile TEN,\" which comprises resource constrained communication devices carried by troopers, equipping sensor nodes deployed in the field or small unmanned aerial vehicles. In an attempt to fill this gap in the studies on battlefield networking, this article seeks to combine software-defined and delay-tolerant approaches to support the diverse range of strict requirements for applications in the last-mile TEN.",

   "abstract": "A core mission of university education is to train students' problem solving abilities, or in some cases, students' research skills. To achieve this, educators assign students certain experiment courses, where students complete a task following preset procedures. However, such courses often employ outdated teaching materials that are far from cutting-edge problems. Meanwhile, a preset experiment procedure cannot evoke students' innovations. In this article we introduce an experimental course we opened at Shanghai Jiao Tong University for junior-year students -- the Research-Oriented Course (ROC). ROC is based on a cutting-edge research project and includes an Introduction -- Demonstration -- Research -- Evaluation four-phase course as well as the T -- W -- R three-dimensional evaluation criteria. Evaluations showed that students finished their research tasks satisfactorily and they improved their research skills through this process.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a unified computing, caching, and communication (3C) solution for the upcoming 5G environment that will allow service, content, and function providers to deploy their services/ content/functions near the end users (EUs); to allow network providers to virtually deploy their connectivity services over commodity hardware; and to enable end users to renounce their role as passive 5G stakeholders and become active ones by offering their 3C resources to the 5G ecosystem. In this direction, we foresee the exploitation of a peer-topeer- like middleware/app solution that upon installation will enhance the end user devices with the ability to form virtual fogs capable of providing their 3C resources to the 5G ecosystem. Additionally, we propose the introduction of heterogeneous nodes (e.g., FPGAs and GPUs) at the networks edge, which will boost the processing capabilities without paying a premium in power consumption. This will enable efficient and thorough filtering of the information that makes it all the way up to the cloud. In summary, this article proposes an architecture that exploits and advances the edge and extreme edge 3C paradigms toward enabling the 5G ecosystem to meet its own criterion for low end-to-end latencies and, as such, enable it to provide and sustain high QoS/QoE levels.",

   "abstract": "The WebRTC initiative has achieved impressive results in terms of the gained industrial interest, the penetration of the technology in end-user devices, and the ever growing community of developers. WebRTC is today supported by major mobile platforms and Internet browsers, allowing potentially billions of users to seamlessly establish real-time communication sessions. Among all the functionalities that must be implemented by WebRTC devices, congestion control is particularly important to ensure that the network operates properly while providing a satisfactory user experience. A working group that is focusing on this issue is the IETF RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT), which aims at defining the requirements and designing congestion control algorithms to be used for the transport of real-time media flows over RTP. This article overviews the status of the standardization efforts that are taking place in the RMCAT working group. We discuss the choices involved in the design of media congestion control, the proposed algorithms, and the issues that are considered still open.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing, as an emerging sensing paradigm, relies significantly on wireless communication networks to provide QoS guaranteed data transmission among smartphone users on phenomena of common interest. The explosively growing number and varieties of smartphones impose heavy burdens on the communication infrastructures of mobile crowdsensing. The communication performance of crowdsensing may deteriorate in some high-density areas due to the overwhelming communication requests, while the wireless bandwidth in other areas may not be fully utilized with sporadic and infrequent communication requests. Therefore, it is of great necessity to consider the imbalanced utilization of wireless resources in the design of a communication paradigm in mobile crowdsensing to meet the stringent QoS requirements. To this end, in this article we propose a congestion-aware communication paradigm for sustainable dense mobile crowdsensing in order to achieve efficient load balancing and reliable communication in mobile crowdsensing.",

   "abstract": "The backhaul forwards aggregated traffic from massive users, machines, and sensors to the core network, and is the key infrastructure to facilitate a smart city. The beamforming and spatial multiplexing technologies enable the wireless multipoint-to-point backhaul to connect dense small cell eNodeBs (eNBs) and macrocell eNBs. Because the spatial characteristics of the backhaul channels, such as the angular power spectra and spreads, determine the interference and capacity performance of the backhaul links, accurate 3D channel modeling is vital for the evaluation and comparison of candidate proposals. In this article, the concepts and methodology of spatial channel modeling are first introduced, and the state-of-the-art models developed by the standardization bodies in recent years are surveyed. Then we present a field measurement campaign on the 3D backhaul channels in an urban street, including the channel sounder implementation, field measurement, multipath parameter estimation, and propagation modeling. The Rx of the sounder (emulating a donor eNB) was installed on the rooftop of a five-story building, and the Tx was located along a street and at different altitudes to emulate a relay eNB. The channel angular power spectra in the elevation and azimuth domains were measured, and the impact by the relay's distance and altitude on the angular spreads was evaluated. In addition, a Laplace model is proposed for the power spectra in both domains. This article not only explains the methodology and implementation of the spatial channel measurement, but also reveals the urban wireless backhaul channel characteristics which are useful for the design and deployment of wireless backhaul for a smart city.",

   "abstract": "In order to cope with the increasing network utilization driven by new mobile clients, and to satisfy demand for new network services and performance guarantees, telecommunication service providers are exploiting virtualization over their network by implementing network services in virtual machines, decoupled from legacy hardware accelerated appliances. This effort, known as NFV, reduces OPEX and provides new business opportunities. At the same time, next generation mobile, enterprise, and IoT networks are introducing the concept of computing capabilities being pushed at the network edge, in close proximity of the users. However, the heavy footprint of today's NFV platforms prevents them from operating at the network edge. In this article, we identify the opportunities of virtualization at the network edge and present Glasgow Network Functions (GNF), a container-based NFV platform that runs and orchestrates lightweight container VNFs, saving core network utilization and providing lower latency. Finally, we demonstrate three useful examples of the platform: IoT DDoS remediation, on-demand troubleshooting for telco networks, and supporting roaming of network functions.",

   "abstract": "As vehicle applications, mobile devices and the Internet of Things are growing fast, and developing an efficient architecture to deal with the big data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been an important concern for the future smart city. To overcome the inherent defect of centralized data processing in cloud computing, fog computing has been proposed by offloading computation tasks to local fog servers (LFSs). By considering factors like latency, mobility, localization, and scalability, this article proposes a regional cooperative fog-computing-based intelligent vehicular network (CFC-IoV) architecture for dealing with big IoV data in the smart city. Possible services for IoV applications are discussed, including mobility control, multi-source data acquisition, distributed computation and storage, and multi-path data transmission. A hierarchical model with intra-fog and inter-fog resource management is presented, and energy efficiency and packet dropping rates of LFSs in CFC-IoV are optimized.",

   "abstract": "Geographic routing is becoming an attractive routing solution for WSNs since it offers a radical departure from traditional topology-dependent routing paradigms through use of geographic location in data delivery. However, it often suffers from the routing hole, referring to an area free of nodes in the direction closer to destination, in various real-world environments such as buildings and obstacles, leading to route failure. Currently, most geographic routing protocols tend to exploit face routing to recover the route. The basic idea behind it is to planarize the whole network by eliminating the crossing links before applying routing algorithms, thus achieving suboptimal network performance. In this article, we first survey representative face-based geographic routing approaches, including their design prerequisites and philosophy. Furthermore, we outline the emerging issues to be addressed in the future and illustrate the forming factors behind them in detail. Based on these observations, we then propose a CAGR to address the routing hole problem by employing relative coordinate systems, avoiding planarizing networks and preserving route optimality properties. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is superior to existing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, control overhead, and delivery delay in WSNs over a variety of communication sessions passing through the routing holes.",

   "abstract": "With the increase of network complexity, there is a high need for network management automation. This is achieved through SON principles that enable self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, even though SON functions are meant to be autonomous, a high level of coordination among them is required. To this end, efficient conflict detection and resolution techniques are needed, especially in multi-vendor deployments. This article presents a design together with a sample implementation of a coordination scheme between three key SON functions in femtocell networks: cell ID assignment, coverage adjustment, and idle mode control. This ensures stability and continuity of the network operation even in a situation when the functions have contradicting objectives. The solution is based on the Broadband Forum TR-069 protocol and is applicable to multi-vendor networks. Simulation evaluation has shown that SON coordination reduces mean cell ID conflicts by over 30 percent and, resulting from that, call drop probability by over 40 percent.",

   "abstract": "Most existing non-real-time applications utilize infrastructure-based or semi-infrastructure-based network architectures. Such a network architecture demands a considerably high installment and maintenance cost. To alleviate the cost, in this article, we propose an efficient infrastructure-less network architecture named CrAN. In CrAN, a set of crowds play significant roles by completing the communication gaps among various associates in the network; hence the name. We show the usability of this proposed architecture to support non-real-time data transmission over an SGMS, where optimum solutions need to be discovered to minimize the management cost. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, we approximate these optimum solutions using a GA. In the implementation of the GA, we apply new fitness functions to discover a feasible trade-off between distance and waste volume. We then compare the performance of the proposed fitness functions with that of an existing fitness function. The results favorably suggest the necessity of employing the proposed fitness functions to obtain near-optimum solutions.",

More recently, with the deep penetration of modern 3G/4G networking and social networking, the crowd intelligence from the social community has been explored toward crowdsourced navigation. In this article, we first provide an overview of the past and present road navigation technologies. We then discuss very recent advances in crowd intelligence, identifying the unique challenges and opportunities therein. We further present a case study that utilizes the crowdsourced driving information to combat the last mile puzzle for road navigation.",

   "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) embody a tight integration between network-based communications, software, sensors, and physical processes. While the integration of cyber technologies within legacy systems will most certainly introduce opportunities and advancements not yet envisioned, it will undoubtedly also pave the way to misdemeanors that will exploit systems' resources, causing drastic and severe nationwide impacts. While almost all works in the literature exclusively tackled the security of one independent aspect of CPS (i.e., cyber or physical), we argue that these systems cannot be decoupled. In this context, we present what we believe is a first attempt ever to tackle the problem of CPS security in a coupled and a systematic manner. To this end, this article proposes a novel approach that federates the cyber and physical environments to infer and attribute tangible CPS attacks. This is achieved by - Leveraging real cyber threat intelligence derived from empirical measurements. - Capturing and investigating CP data flows by devising an innovative CPS threat detector. An added value of the proposed approach is rendered by physical remediation strategies, which are envisioned to automatically be invoked as a reaction to the inferred attacks to provide CPS resiliency. We conclude this article by discussing a few design considerations and presenting three case studies that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

While we see that guard solutions can be implemented with high assurance, we find that obtaining an equivalent level of assurance in the correctness of the security labels easily becomes a hard problem in practical scenarios. Thus, a weakness of the guard-based solution is that there is often limited assurance in the correctness of the security labels. To mitigate this, guards make use of content checkers such as dirty word lists as a means of detecting mislabeled data. To improve the overall security of such cross-domain solutions, we investigate more advanced content checkers based on the use of machine learning. Instead of relying on manually specified dirty word lists, we can build data-driven methods that automatically infer the words associated with classified content. However, care must be taken when constructing and deploying these methods as naive implementations are vulnerable to manipulation attacks. In order to provide a better context for performing classification, we monitor the incoming information flow and use the audit trail to construct controlled environments. The usefulness of this deployment scheme is demonstrated using a real collection of classified and unclassified documents.",

   "abstract": "Data offloading using vehicles is one of the most challenging tasks to perform due to the high mobility of vehicles. There are many solutions available for this purpose, but due to the inefficient management of data along with the control decisions, these solutions are not adequate to provide data offloading by making use of the available networks. Moreover, with the advent of 5G and related technologies, there is a need to cope with high speed and traffic congestion in the existing infrastructure used for data offloading. Hence, to make intelligent decisions for data offloading, an SDN-based scheme is presented in this article. In the proposed scheme, an SDN-based controller is designed that makes decisions for data offloading by using the priority manager and load balancer. Using these two managers in SDN-based controllers, traffic routing is managed efficiently even with an increase in the size of the network. Moreover, a single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game for network selection is also used for data offloading. The proposed scheme is evaluated with respect to several parameters where its performance was found to be superior in comparison to the existing schemes.",

   "abstract": "The contemporary Internet has evolved from an academic infrastructure to a tremendous commercial network, serving as an indispensable information platform for human communications, but with inherent limitations such as complicated management and manual configuration. To overcome these limitations, the basic Internet architecture has unleashed an unprecedented wave of innovation over the past decade, and introduced a promising networking paradigm, software-defined networking (SDN), often referred to as a \"radical new idea in networking.\" SDN offers numerous potential benefits such as enhanced configuration, improved performance, and encouraged innovation in network architectures and operations, while undergoing unprecedented challenges due to the lack of global network-wide information. Nowadays, the emerging data-driven thought opens the era of the fourth paradigm for science research and transfers the design philosophy of future networks, based on the large-scale data rather than the small-scale data. We argue that the existence of a data-driven information plane in SDN can address these challenges. In this article, we explicitly propose a data-driven information plane and extend the SDN architecture specifically. We first overview the evolution of SDN, and then illustrate a novel SDN paradigm by introducing a data-driven information plane into the commonly accepted SDN reference architecture. Finally, we outline emerging challenges and discuss future directions for further research triggered by a data-driven information plane.",

   "abstract": "SDN is a pivotal technology that relies on the fundamental idea of decoupling control and data planes in the network. This property provides several advantages such as flexibility, simplification, and lower costs. However, it also brings several drawbacks that are largely induced by the centralized control paradigm. Security is one of the most significant challenges related to centralization. In that regard, DDoS attacks are particularly pertinent to the SDN environment. This article presents a concise survey on solutions against DDoS attacks in software-defined networks. Moreover, several mechanisms are analyzed, and a comparative classification is provided for rendering the current state of the art in the literature. This analysis will help researchers to address weaknesses of these solutions and thus mitigate such attacks using more effective defense mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "In the smart grid, bidirectional information exchange among customers, operators, and control devices significantly improves the efficiency of energy supplying and consumption. However, integration of intelligence and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual- based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in practical smart grid systems.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, we have observed a resurgence of DDoS attacks. These attacks often exploit vulnerable servers (e.g., DNS and NTP) to produce large amounts of traffic with little effort. However, we have also observed the appearance of application-level DDoS attacks, which leverage corner cases in the logic of an application in order to severely reduce the availability of the provided service. In both cases, these attacks are used to extort a ransom, to hurt a target organization, or to gain some tactical advantage. As it has happened for many of the components in the underground economy, DDoS has been commoditized, and DDoS as a service (DaaS) providers allow paying customers to buy and direct attacks against specific targets. In this article, we present a measurement study of 17 different DaaS providers, in which we analyzed the different techniques used to launch DDoS attacks, as well as the infrastructure leveraged in order to carry out the attacks. Results show a growing market of short-lived providers, where DDoS attacks are available at low cost (tens of dollars) and capable of easily disrupting connections of over 1.4 Gb/s. In our study, particular attention was given to characterize application-level (HTTP) DDoS attacks, which are more difficult to study given the low volume of traffic they generate and the need to study the logic of the application providing the target service.",

   "abstract": "Recently, device-free WiFi CSI-based human behavior recognition has attracted a great amount of interest as it promises to provide a ubiquitous sensing solution by using the pervasive WiFi infrastructure. While most existing solutions are pattern-based, applying machine learning techniques, there is a recent trend of developing accurate models to reveal the underlining radio propagation properties and exploit models for fine-grained human behavior recognition. In this article, we first classify the existing work into two categories: pattern-based and model-based recognition solutions. Then we review and examine the two approaches together with their enabled applications. Finally, we show the favorable properties of model-based approaches by comparing them using human respiration detection as a case study, and argue that our proposed Fresnel zone model could be a generic one with great potential for device-free human sensing using fine-grained WiFi CSI.",

   "abstract": "Optical access networks are continuously evolving toward next generation solutions offering much higher bandwidth per endpoint and considerably longer optical reach. Their dimensioning and planning should be accurate and as close to realistic values as possible to become useful to network operators. This work presents a converged access network planning and dimensioning tool for planning and dimensioning of networks for fixed mobile convergence based on GIS. These networks connect to the CO, endpoints requiring different capacity and reliability constraints. This tool proposes a new clustering algorithm to decrease fiber and duct length. Furthermore, five protection schemes have been proposed, modeled, and compared in dense urban, urban, and rural areas to improve connection availability to the more availability demanding endpoints. The proposed assessment methodology compares the following parameters: component cost, power consumption, connection availability, indirect improvement in connection availability of residential users, FIF, and protection fiber length required per MBS. The article also includes a consolidated comparative analysis to find the best solution fulfilling the specific requirements of any network/service provider.",

   "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number and diversity of smart devices connected to the Internet has raised the issues of flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability within the current IoT network. These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.",

   "abstract": "Current emergency systems and 112 services are based on legacy telecommunication technologies, which cannot cope with IP-based services that European citizens use every day. Some of the related limitations are partial media support, the lack of integration of social media, and the use of an analog modem for providing eCall services with limited data amounts. As most operators have started migrating toward broadband IP-based infrastructures, current emergency systems also need to be upgraded and adapted in order to fulfill regulatory requirements in terms of next generation emergency services. This article presents the EMYNOS project, the goal of which is the design and implementation of a next generation platform capable of accommodating rich-media emergency calls that combine voice, text, and video, thus constituting a powerful tool for coordinating communication among citizens, call centers, and first responders. Additionally, issues such as call routing/redirection to the closest available call center, retrieval of caller location, support for people with disabilities, and integration of social media are detailed.",

   "abstract": "Currently there is an active debate about how the existing cloud paradigm can cope with the volume, variety, and velocity of the data generated by end devices (e.g., Internet of Things sensors). It is expected that there will be over 50 billion of these devices by 2020, which will create more than two Exabytes worth of data each day. Additionally, the vast number of edge devices create a huge ocean of digital resources close to the data source, which, however, remain so far unexploited to their full extent. EXEGESIS proposes to harness these unutilized resources via a three-layer architecture that encompasses the mist, fog, and cloud. The mist network is located at the very bottom, where interconnected objects (Internet of Things devices, small servers, etc.) create neighborhoods of objects. This arrangement is enhanced by a virtual fog layer, which allows for dynamic, ad hoc interconnections among the various neighborhoods. At the top layer resides the cloud with its abundant resources that can also be included in one or more virtual fog neighborhoods. Thus, this article complements and leverages existing cloud architectures, enabling them to interact with this new edge-centric ecosystem of devices/resources, and benefit from the fact that critical data are available where they can add the most value.",

   "abstract": "mcMTC is starting to play a central role in the industrial Internet of Things ecosystem and have the potential to create high-revenue businesses, including intelligent transportation systems, energy/ smart grid control, public safety services, and high-end wearable applications. Consequently, in the 5G of wireless networks, mcMTC have imposed a wide range of requirements on the enabling technology, such as low power, high reliability, and low latency connectivity. Recognizing these challenges, the recent and ongoing releases of LTE systems incorporate support for low-cost and enhanced coverage, reduced latency, and high reliability for devices at varying levels of mobility. In this article, we examine the effects of heterogeneous user and device mobility - produced by a mixture of various mobility patterns - on the performance of mcMTC across three representative scenarios within a multi-connectivity 5G network. We establish that the availability of alternative connectivity options, such as D2D links and drone-assisted access, helps meet the requirements of mcMTC applications in a wide range of scenarios, including industrial automation, vehicular connectivity, and urban communications. In particular, we confirm improvements of up to 40 percent in link availability and reliability with the use of proximate connections on top of the cellular-only baseline.",

   "abstract": "The drastic increase in urbanization over the past few years requires sustainable, efficient, and smart solutions for transportation, governance, environment, quality of life, and so on. The Internet of Things offers many sophisticated and ubiquitous applications for smart cities. The energy demand of IoT applications is increased, while IoT devices continue to grow in both numbers and requirements. Therefore, smart city solutions must have the ability to efficiently utilize energy and handle the associated challenges. Energy management is considered as a key paradigm for the realization of complex energy systems in smart cities. In this article, we present a brief overview of energy management and challenges in smart cities. We then provide a unifying framework for energy-efficient optimization and scheduling of IoT-based smart cities. We also discuss the energy harvesting in smart cities, which is a promising solution for extending the lifetime of low-power devices and its related challenges. We detail two case studies. The first one targets energy-efficient scheduling in smart homes, and the second covers wireless power transfer for IoT devices in smart cities. Simulation results for the case studies demonstrate the tremendous impact of energy- efficient scheduling optimization and wireless power transfer on the performance of IoT in smart cities.",

   "abstract": "The growth of IoT is expected to herald a better quality of life and open up new industrial opportunities. However, it is also raising new challenges in resource constrained wireless networks. Originally designed for human-to-human wireless communications, present wireless networks fail to satisfy the huge connectivity and varying traffic requirements of IoT. Next generation 5G wireless networks are expected to exploit emerging features, like mmWave, massive MIMO, and C-RAN, for providing the enormous connectivity, resource pooling, and energy efficiency required to support commercial rollout of IoT. Exploring these emerging features, we develop 5G-enabled IoT gateways to communicate with the RRHs of 5G C-RAN. The gateways are endowed with efficient compression schemes to significantly improve uplink resource utilization. Our 5G C-RAN prototyping and laboratory experimental results point out a huge opportunity for supporting a massive number of IoT-enabled devices by sophisticated 5G C-RAN deployment and efficient IoT gateway development.",

   "abstract": "Among multiple services delivered over future mobile networks, the most demanding (from the required bandwidth point of view) are related to media streaming, which is a key component in smart applications (entertainment, tourism, surveillance, etc.). Such applications have to exploit a considerable amount of data, which is difficult to achieve especially in dense urban environments. In this context, the article presents a new solution for HTTP-compliant adaptive media streaming applicable to future 5G mobile networks, aimed at increasing bandwidth availability through the use of multiple radio access technologies and direct connections between devices if they are in proximity of each other. The proposed solution considers a scenario in which a high-quality media stream is received by multipath transmission through the radio access network. Collaboration of neighboring devices is exploited by using direct device-to-device links. Thus, proxy nodes can be inserted between a given media receiver and an access network. Toward ensuring optimized resource allocation at both levels, base station-to-device and device-to-device, this article introduces the architectural modules required for collaboration streaming inside the radio access network and end user's device, and proposes enhancements in HTTP-compliant adaptive streaming protocols in order to become suitable for a multipath collaborative scenario.",

   "abstract": "Traditionally, emergency communications between citizens and public authorities relied on legacy telecommunication technologies unable to cope with the agile, rich-media-content communications that mobile users are already using. This is due to the lack of harmonization and interoperable IP-based networking solutions. With the operators currently migrating to broadband IP infrastructures, emergency systems also need to follow this path and adapt their emergency communication platforms to fulfill next generation emergency services regulatory requirements. This becomes even more evident in light of the forthcoming 5G networks, which are envisioned to support an amalgam of diverse applications and services with heterogeneous performance requirements, including mission-critical IoT communication, massive machine-type communication, and gigabit mobile connectivity. Emergency service operators face an enormous challenge in order to synchronize their model of operation with the 5G paradigm. This article studies the challenges that next generation emergency services need to overcome in order to fulfill the requirements for rich-content, real-time, location-specific communications. The concept for next generation emergency communications as described in the project EMYNOS is presented, along with a vision of how this concept can fulfill the 5G requirements for ultra-reliable and ultra-low-latency emergency communications.",

   "abstract": "Traditionally, wireless cellular systems have been designed to operate in FDD paired bands that allocate the same amount of spectrum for both DL and UL communications. Such design is very convenient under symmetric DL/UL traffic conditions, as used to be the case when voice transmission was predominant. However, due to the overwhelming advent of data services, which involves large asymmetries between DL and UL, the conventional FDD solution becomes inefficient. In this regard, flexible duplexing concepts aim to derive procedures to improve spectrum utilization by adjusting resources to actual traffic demand. In this work, we review these concepts and propose the introduction of TDD SeNB to operate in the unused resources of an FDD-based system. This proposal alleviates the saturated DL/UL transmission commonly found in FDD-based systems through user offloading toward a TDD system based on SeNBs. In this context, the flexible duplexing concept is analyzed from three points of view: regulation, LTE standardization, and technical solutions.",

   "abstract": "Tremendous advancements in heterogeneous communication technologies have enabled smart cities objects to interact with each other while ensuring network connectivity. However, these communication technologies cannot provide flawless connectivity in smart cities due to the coexistence of thousands of devices, which brings about several problems. In this article, we discuss the enabling communication and networking technologies used in smart cities. The similarities and differences among different communication technologies based on the important parameters are also analyzed. Moreover, a taxonomy is devised by classifying the literature based on future and emerging technologies, modern communication technologies, IEEE wireless technology standards, objectives, network classes, and mode of operations. Furthermore, some reported case studies of different cities (Barcelona, Stratford, Singapore, and Porto) are also presented. Lastly, several research challenges, such as interference management, scalable wireless solutions, interoperability support among heterogeneous wireless networks, mobility management, and high energy consumption that remain to be addressed for enabling unimpaired connectivity in smart cities are discussed as future research directions.",

   "abstract": "Mobile devices have promoted users' mobility; therefore, there is a necessity to provide services that accomplish users' requirements at any place and time. With this, location becomes a key aspect of providing the dynamism required by solutions like the provisioning of reasonable mobile services by service provider networks. In that sense, the SDN paradigm arose to evolve from current static networks, which are manually configured by administrators, toward dynamic networks able to manage on their own at runtime and on demand. Solutions managing the SDN resources by using policies have been proposed, but they do not consider one of the main aspects to network dynamism: mobility. This article presents a mobility-aware and policy-based on-demand control network solution oriented to the SDN paradigm. This is in charge of managing, at runtime, the service and/or system state with high-level policies, which consider the mobility of users and services, the network statistics, and the infrastructure location. In this context, we define different use cases with the concerns of end users when they are in very crowded places, and the solutions provided by our solution through policies: balancing the network traffic between the infrastructure located close to the overloaded one; creating or dismantling geolocated virtual network infrastructure when the existing one is not enough, or is misused to meet end-user demands; and restricting specific network traffic in critical scenarios, like in sports events where crowds consume services with large bandwidth.",

   "abstract": "Full-duplex radio has potential to double spectral efficiency by simultaneously transmitting and receiving signals in the same frequency band, but at the expense of additional hardware and power consumption for self-interference cancellation. Hence, the deployment of a full-duplex cellular network can be realized by employing full-duplex functionality only at an eNodeB, which is supposed to have sufficient computation and power resources, and by scheduling pairs of half-duplex UEs that are in either downlink or uplink. By doing so, fast and smooth full-duplex deployment is possible while minimally affecting the legacy UEs and the rest of the network entities. In this article, we provide technical challenges and solutions for an LTE-compatible full-duplex cellular network, featuring wideband and wide dynamic range support for RF self-interference cancellation, and robust and efficient self-interference channel estimation for digital self-interference cancellation. Based on a realistic LTE-based cellular model, our full-duplex radio design is evaluated through system-level simulations and real-world testbed experiments. Simulation results show that a significant throughput gain can be achieved by the full-duplex technique despite the existence of physical limiting factors such as path loss, fading, and other-cell interference. Testbed measurements reveal that at a bandwidth of 20 MHz, self-interference cancellation up to 37 dB is achieved in the RF domain, and most of the residual self-interference is further cancelled down to the noise floor in the subsequent digital domain.",

However, vulnerabilities in smart grid arise due to public communication infrastructure and Internet-based protocols. To deal with security threats, energy big data should be thoughtfully stored and processed to extract critical information, and security and blackout warnings should be given in an early stage. This work gives a comprehensive tutorial and survey to highlight research challenges on the aforementioned issues in the Internet-of-Things-based smart grid. We demonstrate that a stealthy and blind energy big data attack can be launched using a replay scheme. Also, we elucidate an intuitive geometric viewpoint for this type of attack. The proposed attack can bypass bad data detection successfully using either DC or AC state estimation.",

   "abstract": "The deployment of a large number of small cells poses new challenges to energy efficiency, which has often been ignored in 5G cellular networks. While massive MIMO will reduce the transmission power at the expense of higher computational cost, the question remains as to which (computation or transmission power) is more important in the energy efficiency of 5G small cell networks. Thus, the main objective in this article is to investigate the computation power based on the Landauer principle. Simulation results reveal that more than 50 percent of the energy is consumed by the computation power at 5G small cell BSs. Moreover, the computation power of a 5G small cell BS can approach 800 W when massive MIMO (e.g., 128 antennas) is deployed to transmit high volume traffic. This clearly indicates that computation power optimization can play a major role in the energy efficiency of small cell networks.",

   "abstract": "Renewable EH technology is expected to be pervasively utilized in 5G mobile networks to support sustainable network developments and operations. However, the renewable energy supply is inherently random and intermittent, which could lead to energy outage, energy overflow, QoS degradation, and so on. Accordingly, how to enhance renewable energy sustainability is a critical issue for green networking. To this end, an energy-sustainable traffic steering framework is proposed in this article, where the traffic load is dynamically adjusted to match energy distributions in both the spatial and temporal domains by means of interand intra-tier steering, caching, and pushing. Case studies are carried out, which demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce on-grid energy demand while satisfying QoS requirements. Research topics and challenges of energy-sustainable traffic steering are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "With the surge in smartphone sensing, wireless networking, and mobile social networking techniques, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has become a promising paradigm for 5G networks. An MCS system's service quality heavily depends on the platform, which brings the users under a common cloud with very low delay. Therefore, MCS needs a new platform that brings the best not only from the user's perspective, but also from the operator's perspective. In this article, we propose a novel architecture for MCS by combining two technologies, those being C-RAN and D2D. C-RAN is a promising enabling technology that can at the same time cope with the ever increasing mobile traffic demand and reduce the surging costs experienced by service operators. In spite of the many advantages offered by C-RAN, one of the main concerns for operators is its associated fronthaul delay. To handle such delay, we come across this D2D solution in C-RAN networks. D2D is adopted as an effective candidate for very low delay between links and has already provided evidence of its potential for novel business opportunities. This article shows, together with standardization aspects, how combining C-RAN and D2D technologies can help to solve the delay issue and fulfill most of the targets specified for 5G networks in terms of delay, capacity, energy efficiency, mobility, and cost.",

   "abstract": "Vehicular networking is promising to improve traffic efficiency and driving safety, as well as travel experience. However, the traditional network employs a highly coupled design, which is quite limited in its ability to satisfy various challenging vehicular demands. Recently, new studies focus on how to design software defined vehicular networks smartly to meet various vehicular demands. In this article, we investigate a new smart identifier networking (SINET) paradigm and propose a SINET customized solution enabling crowd collaborations for software defined vehicular networks (SINET-V). In particular, through crowd sensing, network function slices are well organized with a group of function-similar components. Different function slices are further driven to serve various applications by using crowd collaborations. We clearly illustrate how SINET-V works and also analyze its potential advantages in several special vehicular instances. Experimental results show that SINET-V has great potential to promote powerful vehicular networks.",

   "abstract": "CMIMO is an effective approach to increase throughput and energy efficiency through the collaboration of individual antennas working together as a virtual multi-antenna system. Several CMIMO strategies have been propounded as major candidates for achieving green communications in wireless sensor networks. Compared to conventional MIMO, CMIMO provides significant gains in terms of flexibility. Recently, more advanced cooperation strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of CMIMO by using emerging techniques such as spatial modulation and coding. Although some breakthroughs have been made in this area, the problem of how to accurately adopt these emerging techniques to model CMIMO is far from being fully understood. This article surveys several state-of-the-art CMIMO models for different scenarios, including data aggregated, multihop-based, and clustered schemes. Moreover, it discusses the implementation of CMIMO techniques, which are expected to be candidate techniques for green communications in modern applications. In the implementation, the trade-offs between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, quality of service, fairness, and security are discussed. Several simulation results are given to show how emerging techniques in CMIMO design can lead to energy efficiency enhancement. Finally, some challenges and open issues that present future research directions are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The commercial success of LTE makes it the primary standard for 4G cellular technology, and its evolution paves the path for 5G technology. Furthermore, LTE Unlicensed has been proposed recently to allow cellular network operators to offload some of their data traffic to LTE component carriers operating in the unlicensed band. Hence, it is critical to ensure that the LTE system performs effectively even in harsh signaling environments in both licensed and unlicensed spectrum. This article analyzes the effect of different levels of RF spoofing applied to LTE. RF spoofing affects LTE devices during the initial cell selection process, where a strong nearby cell can impede access to a serving LTE network. This is a serious threat and can be caused unintentionally, in the case of dense and uncoordinated LTE deployment in unlicensed spectrum, or intentionally, where an adversary sets up a fake LTE cell in either licensed or unlicensed LTE spectrum. This article analyzes and experimentally demonstrates the severity of these threats for the evolution of LTE and proposes effective mitigation techniques to prevent denial of service. These mitigation techniques improve the cell selection process at the LTE user equipment, and are backward-compatible with existing LTE networks. We recommend that these modifications be enforced in future releases for increasing the availability and scalability of LTE.",

However, the adoption of these evolved technologies in emergency communications between citizens and public authorities faces a series of barriers, including the lack of harmonized and interoperable solutions. Different initiatives worldwide are addressing the need for specifying a stable IP-based next generation emergency communications framework. This article provides a general overview of the different international approaches with special focus on the European perspective, where the NG112 architecture has been specified, and it has now entered the testing and evaluation phase.",

   "abstract": "One of the important use cases for WebRTC is multi-party audio/video conferencing, and there are multiple services that offer that functionality. Two aspects that the maintainers of such services often try to optimize are the maximum size of their conferences, and the cost of their infrastructure. Simulcast is one approach to addressing these problems in conference systems that build upon video routers. It consists of the simultaneous transmission of multiple versions of a participant's video stream, which use different resolutions, frame rates and, most importantly, different bit rates. In this article we present the analysis and experimental evaluation of a conference system based on WebRTC using simulcast with the VP8 codec. We examine the computational and bandwidth requirements of both the server and the clients, as well as the end-to-end video quality. Our results show significant gains for the receivers and the infrastructure, with minor penalties to the image quality and resource usage for the senders.",

In this article, we present the design, implementation, and deployment of a positioning system based on mobile and fixed inexpensive proximity sensors that we use to track when individuals are close to an instrumented object or placed at certain points of interest. To overcome loss of data between mobile and fixed sensors due to crowd density, traditional approaches are extended with mobile-to-mobile proximity information. We tested our system in a museum crowded with thousands of visitors, showing that measurement accuracy increases in the presence of more individuals wearing a proximity sensor. Furthermore, we show that density information can be leveraged to study the behavior of the visitors, for example, to track the popularity of points of interest, and the flow and distribution of visitors across floors.",

   "abstract": "Efficient urban transportation systems are widely accepted as essential infrastructure for smart cities, and they can highly increase a city's vitality and convenience for residents. The three core pillars of smart cities can be considered to be data mining technology, IoT, and mobile wireless networks. Enormous data from IoT is stimulating our cities to become smarter than ever before. In transportation systems, data-driven management can dramatically enhance the operating efficiency by providing a clear and insightful image of passengers' transportation behavior. In this article, we focus on the data validity problem in a cellular network based transportation data collection system from two aspects: internal time discrepancy and data loss. First, the essence of time discrepancy was analyzed for both automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicular location (AVL) systems, and it was found that time discrepancies can be identified and rectified by analyzing passenger origin inference success rate using different time shift values and evolutionary algorithms. Second, the algorithmic framework to handle location data loss and time discrepancy was provided. Third, the spatial distribution characteristics of location data loss events were analyzed, and we discovered that they have a strong and positive relationship with both high passenger volume and shadowing effects in urbanized areas, which can cause severe biases on passenger traffic analysis. Our research has proposed some data-driven methodologies to increase data validity and provided some insights into the influence of IoT level data loss on public transportation systems for smart cities.",

LTE in unlicensed spectrum has been proposed to allow cellular network operators to offload some of their data traffic by accessing the unlicensed 5 GHz frequency band. Currently, there are three proposed variants for LTE operation in the unlicensed band, namely LTE-U, licensed assisted access (LAA), and MulteFire. This article provides a comparative analysis of these variants and explains the current regulations of the 5 GHz band in different parts of the world. We present the technical details of the three proposed versions and analyze them in terms of their operational features and coexistence capabilities to provide an R&amp;D perspective for their deployment and coexistence with legacy systems.",

   "abstract": "Wireless spectrum being a valuable resource, a large number of both non-profit and for-profit users rely on its unlicensed parts, usually to provide some sort of local area wireless coverage. When the cellular vendors and service providers expressed interest in the unlicensed spectrum, the incumbent community started to fear that the new technology would not respect the existing users. And although members of the incumbent community strongly influenced the design of licensed assisted access (LAA) in 3GPP, the fear has not dispersed yet. Representing a vendor with stakes in both communities, we attempt to disperse the fear by providing insight on the question of fairness and performance of LAA, openly discussing why it should generate less interference than WiFi and why it could be otherwise. We augment the discussion with insightful simulations, looking how detailed parameters of the channel access mechanism influence LAA's fairness and performance. Our investigations show that in common scenarios LAA is a fair neighbor to WiFi as is, and even in an extreme scenario only small adjustments to the channel access mechanism are needed to achieve the same outcome.",

   "abstract": "The next generation of wireless telecommunications, 5G, is expected to have tight interworking between its novel air interface and legacy standards, such as the LTE. The major difference from interworking between previous RAT generations is that there will be common CN functionalities, enabling faster RAT scheduling due to reduced time spent with signaling. In this context, this article aims at exploiting an FS solution to improve QoS metrics of the system by means of efficient RAT scheduling. Analyses presented here show a better understanding concerning which system measurements are most efficient in a mutliple-RAT scenario. More specifically, we present an analysis concerning the metrics that should be used as RAT scheduling criteria and how frequent these switching evaluations should be done. Finally, we also compare the performance of DC and FS solutions, highlighting the scenarios in which each of them performs better than the other.",

   "abstract": "The exponentially growing healthcare costs coupled with the increasing interest of patients in receiving care in the comfort of their own homes have prompted a serious need to revolutionize healthcare systems. This has prompted active research in the development of solutions that enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor and evaluate the health of patients in the comfort of their residences. However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.",

   "abstract": "This article reviews the R&amp;D activities in few-mode fibers, a special class of multimode optical fibers, beginning with its original motivation in the late 1970s, the operation principles, and the reason why research was discontinued in the mid-1980s. Preliminary characterizations of the test few-mode fiber fabricated for the first time are also introduced. Besides the earlier works, we review the progress of few-mode fibers after the resurgence of research in the 2010s on optical transmission and networking through mode-division multiplexing and other emerging applications. Recent revisiting of few-mode fibers is totally different from the original motivation, and it is mainly to solve the capacity crunch problem of optical fiber transmissions using legacy single-mode fibers. We address difficult challenges current research on mode-division multiplexing is facing, including differential mode group delay, channel crosstalk due to mode coupling, and their compensation technique through multiple-input multiple-output electronic signal processing. We also address the general perspective of niche applications in the near future. Such a revisit of few-mode fibers after its invention more than 30 years ago deserves showcasing for those engaged in research and development today to show how all research can eventually prove to be important no matter if it finds practical usage for different purposes in the beginning or not, as well as how people can work out a certain problem in many different ways.",

   "abstract": "A robust and reliable synchronization network, able to distribute signals traceable to a recognized standard, is crucial for the operation of future 5G telecommunication networks. In this article we present the results of time transfer using optical fibers. The main goal is to test the long-term capability of ELSTAB technology (developed by AGH) to deliver time and frequency signals traceable at the sub-nanosecond level to UTC in a real telecommunication environment. In an ongoing cooperation between Deutsche Telekom (DTAG), the Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and AGH University of Science and Technology, we deliver UTC -- as realized by PTB in Braunschweig -- to a test center of DTAG located in Bremen. For this purpose, a fiber optic link has been operated since July 2015. The results obtained show that the operator of a telecom network may use such a stabilized fiber optic link as a reliable source for synchronization signals with a precision and accuracy superior to those obtained using a state-of-the-art GNSS time receiver. Moreover, a fiber optic link delivering UTC traceable signals increases the robustness and reliability of the network's synchronization chain by making it less dependent on GNSS.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things is large-scale by nature. This is not only manifested by the large number of connected devices, but also by the sheer scale of spatial traffic intensity that must be accommodated, primarily in the uplink direction. To that end, cellular networks are indeed a strong first mile candidate to accommodate the data tsunami to be generated by the IoT. However, IoT devices are required in the cellular paradigm to undergo random access procedures as a precursor to resource allocation. Such procedures impose a major bottleneck that hinders cellular networks' ability to support large-scale IoT. In this article, we shed light on the random access dilemma and present a case study based on experimental data as well as system-level simulations. Accordingly, a case is built for the latent need to revisit random access procedures. A call for action is motivated by listing a few potential remedies and recommendations.",

   "abstract": "Deep fiber deployments for ultrafast broadband are both technically and economically challenging. Fixed access network sharing (FANS) offers a highly enhanced form of virtual unbundling of broadband access networks, enabling cost sharing and the dynamics of a competitive landscape. Data, control, and management interfaces are automated and harmonized among wholesale infrastructure providers and retail virtual network operators. Standardized FANS interfaces can greatly decrease OPEX while increasing customer satisfaction. When FANS is implemented, network slicing logically partitions and isolates network resources among the VNOs, and such sharing can split the cost of network upgrades among several entities. FANS works with virtualization, where control plane functions are migrated from dedicated network equipment into software running on commodity hardware, with FANS providing network as a service. This article describes the drivers behind FANS, several architectures supporting FANS, and emerging standards supporting FANS.",

   "abstract": "In modern switches, a packet can go through a number of processing steps to determine, for example, if the packet has to be discarded due to security policies, if it needs to be marked for quality of service or to determine the next hop for the packet. Most of those steps can be modeled as a matching of some of the packet fields with a set of rules that are stored in the switch. This has been generalized with the adoption of Software Defined Networks, using for example, the Openflow protocol, on which the processing steps are programmable as table matching operations and defined dynamically by a controller. Implementing this flexible packet matching in a switch is challenging, as we need to support multiple matching tables, each having different key size, and the size of the tables should also be programmable. The main options to support multiple tables are to use different memories for each table or to have several tables share the same memories. In the first approach, each table would have to match the size and width of the memories to achieve an efficient memory usage. This is a severe limitation when flexible table size and entry width need to be supported. In the second approach, all the tables can dynamically share the memories, providing better flexibility. The problem is that the width of the memories needs to be dimensioned to support the largest entry size. This leads to significant memory waste for smaller entries. Hash based techniques like cuckoo hashing can be used to efficiently implement exact matching using standard SRAM memories, and are widely used in modern switches. However, current implementations only support entries of one size. This article presents the Single Double cuckoo hash, which can support elements of two sizes. Its main benefit is to improve memory utilization when multiple tables with entries of different sizes share the same memories. This is achieved at the cost of a small increase in circuit complexity.",

   "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the booming popularity of CLS platforms, through which numerous amateur broadcasters live stream their video contents to viewers around the world. The heterogeneous qualities and formats of the source streams, however, require massive computational resources to transcode them into multiple industrial standard quality versions to serve viewers with distinct configurations, and the delays to the viewers of different locations should be well synchronized to support community interactions. This article attempts to address these challenges and to explore the opportunities with new generation computation paradigms, in particular, fog computing. We present a novel fog-based transcoding framework for CLS platforms to offload the transcoding workload to the network edge (i.e., the massive number of viewers). We evaluate our design through our PlanetLab-based experiment and real-world viewer transcoding experiment.",

   "abstract": "Equipped with easy-to-access micro computation access points, the fog computing architecture provides low-latency and ubiquitously available computation offloading services to many simple and cheap Internet of Things devices with limited computing and energy resources. One obstacle, however, is how to seamlessly hand over mobile IoT devices among different computation access points when computation offloading is in action so that the offloading service is not interrupted -- especially for time-sensitive applications. In this article, we propose Follow Me Fog (FMF), a framework supporting a new seamless handover timing scheme among different computation access points. Intrinsically, FMF supports a job pre-migration mechanism, which pre-migrates computation jobs when the handover is expected to happen. Such expectations can be indicated by constantly monitoring received signal strengths. Then we present the design and a prototype implementation of FMF. Our evaluation results demonstrate that FMF can achieve a substantial latency reduction (36.5 percent in our experiment). In conclusion, the FMF design clears a core obstacle, allowing fog computing to provide interruption-resistant services to mobile IoT devices.",

   "abstract": "Long Term Evolution, the fourth generation of mobile communication technology, has been commercially deployed for about five years. Even though it is continuously updated through new releases, and with LTE Advanced Pro Release 13 being the latest one, the development of the fifth generation has been initiated. In this article, we measure how current LTE network implementations perform in comparison with the initial LTE requirements. The target is to identify certain key performance indicators that have suboptimal implementations and therefore lend themselves to careful consideration when designing and standardizing next generation wireless technology. Specifically, we analyze user and control plane latency, handover execution time, and coverage, which are critical parameters for connected mobility use cases such as road vehicle safety and efficiency. We study the latency, handover execution time, and coverage of four operational LTE networks based on 19,000 km of drive tests covering a mixture of rural, suburban, and urban environments. The measurements have been collected using commercial radio network scanners and measurement smartphones. Even though LTE has low air interface delays, the measurements reveal that core network delays compromise the overall round-trip time design requirement. LTE's breakbefore- make handover implementation causes a data interruption at each handover of 40 ms at the median level. While this is in compliance with the LTE requirements, and lower values are certainly possible, it is also clear that break-before-make will not be sufficient for connected mobility use cases such as road vehicle safety. Furthermore, the measurements reveal that LTE can provide coverage for 99 percent of the outdoor and road users, but the LTE-M or NarrowBand-IoT upgrades, as of LTE Release 13, are required in combination with other measures to allow for additional penetration losses, such as those experienced in underground parking lots. Based on the observed discrepancies between measured and standardized LTE performance, in terms of latency, handover execution time, and coverage, we conclude the article with a discussion of techniques that need careful consideration for connected mobility in fifth generation mobile communication technology.",

   "abstract": "Full-duplex (FD) communications with simultaneous transmission and reception on the same carrier have long been deemed a promising way to boost spectrum efficiency, but hindered by the techniques for self-interference cancellation (SIC). Recent breakthroughs in analog and digital signal processing yield the feasibility of over 100 dB SIC capability, and make it possible for FD communications to demonstrate nearly doubled spectrum efficiency for point-to-point links. Now it is time to shift at least partially our focus to FD networking, such as in cellular networks. FD networking has more complicated interference environments. Therefore, its performance improvement is not that straightforward compared with half-duplex networking. Before putting FD networking into practice, we need to understand to which scenarios FD communications should be applied under the current technology maturity, how bad the performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved after applying advanced interference management solutions. We will discuss all these questions in this article. In particular, we will investigate advanced interference management solutions, including power control and user scheduling, and show that up to 91 percent spectrum efficiency gain and 110 percent energy efficiency gain of FD cellular networks over its HD counterpart can be achieved by applying these solutions.",

   "abstract": "Recent significant advances in self-interference cancellation techniques pave the way for the deployment of full-duplex wireless transceivers capable of concurrent transmission and reception on the same channel. Despite the promise to theoretically double the spectrum efficiency, full-duplex prototyping in off-the-shelf chips of mobile devices is still in its infancy, mainly because of the challenges in mitigating self-interference to a tolerable level and the strict hardware constraints. In this article, we argue in favor of embedding full-duplex radios in onboard units of future vehicles. Unlike the majority of mobile devices, vehicular onboard units are good candidates to host complex full-duplex transceivers because of their virtually unlimited power supply and processing capacity. Taking into account the effect of imperfect self-interference cancellation, we investigate the design implications of full-duplex devices at the higher-layer protocols of next-generation vehicular networks and highlight the benefits they could bring with respect to half-duplex devices in some representative use cases. Early results are also provided that give insight into the impact of self-interference cancellation on vehicle-to-roadside communications, and showcase the benefits of FD-enhanced medium access control protocols for vehicle-to-vehicle communications supporting crucial road safety applications.",

Due to the innovative move of migrating the baseband processing functionalities to the centralized cloud baseband unit pool, C-RAN is anticipated to reduce energy consumption significantly to be a green RAN. Moreover, with the cloud-based architecture, lots of new functionalities and RAN designs are ready to be incorporated, which redefines the RAN as a flexible RAN. In this article, we review the recent advances of exploiting cloud computing to form a green and flexible C-RAN from two cloud-based properties: centralized processing and the software-defined environment. For the centralized processing property, we include coordinated multipoint and limited fronthaul capacity, multicasting, and CSI issues in C-RAN. For the software-defined environment property, we summarize elastic service scaling, functionality splitting, and functionality extension. We also include some of our recent research results and discuss several open challenges.",

   "abstract": "As a result of rapid advancement in communication technologies, the Internet of Things (i.e., ubiquitous connectivity among a very large number of persons and physical objects) is now becoming a reality. Nonetheless, a variety of challenges remain to be addressed, one of them being the efficient resource management in IoT. On one hand, central resource allocation is infeasible for large numbers of entities, due to excessive computational cost as well as immoderate overhead required for information acquisition. On the other hand, the devices connecting to IoT are expected to act smart, making decisions and performing tasks without human intervention. These characteristics render distributed resource management an essential feature of future IoT. Traditionally, game theory is applied to effectively analyze the interactive decision making of agents with conflicting interests. Nevertheless, conventional game models are not adequate to model large-scale systems, since they suffer from many shortcomings including analytical complexity, slow convergence, and excessive overhead due to information acquisition/exchange. In this article, we explore some non-conventional game theoretic models that fit the inherent characteristics of future large-scale IoT systems. Specifically, we discuss evolutionary games, mean field games, minority games, mean field bandit games, and mean field auctions. We provide the basics of each of these game models and discuss the potential IoT-related resource management problems that can be solved by using these models. We also discuss challenges, pitfalls, and future research directions.",

   "abstract": "Software defined networking has brought new interesting challenges by externalizing the task of controlling the network to some generic computer software. In particular, the controller software can modify the network routes by introducing new forwarding rules and deleting old ones at a distributed set of switches, a challenge that has received lots of attention in the last six years. In this article, we survey the different techniques to update rules, sometimes relying on redundant paths to reroute the traffic during the update, sometimes activating rules at distinct switches in a specific order, to avoid looping packets. This state of the art helps understand another, often overlooked, problem that consists of determining the appropriate point in the update where it is safe to garbage collect old rules. To illustrate the difficulty of the problem, we list the previously proposed assumptions, like the upper bound on the transmission delay of every packet through the network. Finally, we propose a solution that alleviates these assumptions and speeds up the original two-phase rule update by about 80 percent through the use of dedicated clean-up packets that detect the absence of in-flight packets.",

Unlike most works that focus on client sides, this study is intended for market planning, from the perspective of enterprises. Several novel crowdsourced features based on metatrails, including hotspot networks, crowd transitions, affinity subnetworks, and sequential visiting patterns, are discussed in the article. These smart footprints can reflect crowd preferences and the topology of a site of interest. Marketers can utilize such information for commercial resource planning and deployment.

Unfortunately, communication and services may be compromised due to a number of factors including unreliable communication, complexity, and security threats like spoofing. Within the technologies involved in the IoT paradigm, passive RFID allows the inventorying of simple objects toward wireless communication with a low-cost investment. We present a solution to increase the personalization of IoT applications and services (e.g., accessing a restricted area with a contact- less card) by detecting people-object gestures with an accelerometer-enabled passive RFID tag. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal by achieving a precision of 85 percent in people-object gestures classification.",

   "abstract": "The network functions virtualization paradigm is rapidly gaining interest among Internet service providers. However, the transition to this paradigm on ISP networks comes with a unique set of challenges: legacy equipment already in place, heterogeneous traffic from multiple clients, and very large scalability requirements. In this article we thoroughly analyze such challenges and discuss NFV design guidelines that address them efficiently. Particularly, we show that a decentralization of NFV control while maintaining global state improves scalability, offers better per-flow decisions and simplifies the implementation of virtual network functions. Building on top of such principles, we propose a partially decentralized NFV architecture enabled via an enhanced software-defined networking infrastructure. We also perform a qualitative analysis of the architecture to identify advantages and challenges. Finally, we determine the bottleneck component, based on the qualitative analysis, which we implement and benchmark in order to assess the feasibility of the architecture.",

   "abstract": "The smart power grid enables intelligent automation at all levels of power system operation, from electricity generation at power plants to power usage in the home. The key enabling factor of an efficient smart grid is its built-in ICT, which monitors the real-time system operating state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic- based security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and attacking the ICT system of the smart grid. We also highlight several promising future research directions on graph-based security analysis and its applications in smart power grid.",

   "abstract": "As a flexible and scalable architecture, heterogeneous cloud radio access networks (H-CRANs) inject strong vigor into the green evolution of current wireless networks. But the brutal truth is that EE improves at the cost of other indices such as SE, fairness, and delay. It is thus important to investigate performance trade-offs for striking flexible balances between energy-efficient transmission and excellent QoS guarantees under this new architecture. In this article, we first propose some potential techniques to energy-efficiently operate H-CRANs by exploiting their features. We then elaborate the initial ideas of modeling three fundamental trade-offs, namely EE-SE, EE-fairness, and EE-delay trade-offs, when applying these green techniques, and present open issues and challenges for future investigation. These related results are expected to shed light on green operation of H-CRANs from adaptive resource allocation, intelligent network control, and scalable network planning.",

   "abstract": "Technical standards support compatibility and interoperability among numerous entities existing in the telecommunications market. However, the university curricula rarely include standards analysis and rarely encourage students to create solutions that are based on the standards. This fact poses a hindrance in the adoption of new technologies due to the fact that recent graduates as young professionals will most certainly have difficulties in using new standards they may get in touch with on their first job. In our approach, we acknowledge the need for students to work with standards before they graduate. Research activities, connected with industrial projects in which application of new standardized technologies is in focus, are combined with student projects, enabling students to get their own hands-on experience in analyzing and applying telecommunications standards. As the result, students gain valuable experience for their future careers, an academic setting is used as a safe environment for testing and possibly even enhancing new standards, and the industry attains deeper knowledge about standards and technologies that could be used in their real-world deployments.",

   "abstract": "In this article, the prospects and enabling technologies for high-efficiency device positioning and location-aware communications in emerging 5G networks are reviewed. We will first describe some key technical enablers and demonstrate by means of realistic ray-tracing and map based evaluations that positioning accuracies below one meter can be achieved by properly fusing direction and delay related measurements on the network side, even when tracking moving devices. We will then discuss the possibilities and opportunities that such high-efficiency positioning capabilities can offer, not only for location-based services in general, but also for the radio access network itself. In particular, we will demonstrate that geometric location-based beamforming schemes become technically feasible, which can offer substantially reduced reference symbol overhead compared to classic full channel state information (CSI)-based beamforming. At the same time, substantial power savings can be realized in future wideband 5G networks where acquiring full CSI calls for wideband reference signals while location estimation and tracking can, in turn, be accomplished with narrowband pilots.",

In this article, we propose novel four-tier architecture for urban traffic management with the convergence of VANETs, 5G networks, software-defined networks, and mobile edge computing technologies. The proposed architecture provides better communication and more rapid responsive speed in a more distributed and dynamic manner. The practical case of rapid accident rescue can significantly shorten the rescue time. Key technologies with respect to vehicle localization, data pre-fetching, traffic lights control, and traffic prediction are also discussed. Obviously, the novel architecture shows noteworthy potential for alleviating traffic congestion and improving the efficiency of urban traffic management.",

In this article, we give a comprehensive introduction to HBR using Wi-Fi channel state information. We first comprehensively review the state-of-art of HBR, based on the two techniques that drove recent progress in Wi-Fi channel-state-information-based HBR -- fingerprint-based and model-based. Specifically, we describe their corresponding characteristics, general architectures, and provide a performance comparison of the two mechanisms. We then provide insights into the future directions of HBR research, and propose two possible new schemes, and the technical challenges coming with them.",

   "abstract": "A former definition states that a brain-computer Interface provides a direct communication channel to the brain without the need for muscles and nerves. With the emergence of wearable and wireless brain-computer interfaces, these systems have evolved to become part of wireless body area networks, offering people-centric applications such as cognitive workload assessment and detection of selective attention. Currently, wireless body area networks are mostly integrated by low-cost devices that, because of their limited hardware resources, cannot generate secure random numbers for encryption. This is a critical issue in the context of new Internet of Things device communication and its security. Such devices require securing their communication, mostly by means of the automatic renewal of the cryptographic keys. In the domain of the people-centric Internet of Things, we propose to use wireless brain-computer interfaces as a secure source of entropy, based on neuro- activity, capable to generate secure keys that outperforms other generation methods. In our approach, current wireless brain-computer interface technology is an attractive option to offer novel services emerged from novel necessities in the context of the people-centric Internet of Things. Our proposal is an implementation of the human-in-the-loop paradigm, in which devices and humans indistinctly request and offer services to each other for mutual benefit.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing is a novel sensing paradigm enabled by the proliferation of mobile devices. Since crowdsensing applications are driven by sufficient users, advanced incentive mechanisms have been designed to enhance users' willingness to participate in sensing tasks. However, incentive mechanisms only provide adequate sensing opportunities on the condition that the available user base is large. If existing users are fewer than the required number of participants, incentive mechanisms will lose efficacy. This article proposes a hybrid framework called HySense to compensate for inadequate sensing opportunities solely provided by incentive mechanisms. Within each sensing cycle, HySense combines mobile devices with static sensor nodes to generate uniformly distributed space-time data under the constraint of field coverage. To balance sensing opportunities among different geographic regions, redundant users are efficiently migrated from densely populated areas to sparsely populated areas. HySense utilizes calibration mode for checking whether the participants' behavior patterns are consistent with the sensing task queue. Therefore, any change caused by unforeseen accidents can be dealt with in advance.",

This article provides a comprehensive survey of the various incarnations of such structures that have been proposed in the literature. We provide a taxonomy in terms of the required channel state information, that is, whether the processing adapts to the instantaneous or average (second-order) channel state information; while the former provides somewhat better signal- to-noise and interference ratio, the latter has much lower overhead for CSI acquisition. We furthermore distinguish hardware structures of different complexities. Finally, we point out the special design aspects for operation at millimeter-wave frequencies.",

   "abstract": "Heterogeneous ultra-dense networks (HUDNs) can significantly increase the spectral efficiency of cellular networks and cater for the explosive growth of data traffic in 5G communications. Due to the dense deployment of small cells, interference among neighboring cells becomes severe. As a result, effective resource allocation and user association algorithms are essential to minimize inter-cell interference and optimize network performance. However, optimizing network resources in an HUDN is extremely complicated as resource allocation and user association are coupled. Therefore, an HUDN requires low-complexity but effective resource allocation schemes to address these issues. Hypergraph theory has been recognized as a useful mathematical tool to model the complex relations among multiple entities. In this article, we show how the hypergraph models can be used to effectively tackle resource allocation problems in an HUDN. We also discuss several potential research issues in this field.",

   "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11ad amendment to the 802.11 standard ratified in 2012 created the first multi- Gb/s Wi-Fi technology by using the large swath of unlicensed spectrum at the mm-Wave band. While enabling multi-Gb/s wireless local communications was a significant achievement, throughput and reliability requirements of new applications, such as augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wireless backhauling, exceed what 802.11ad can offer. For this reason, building upon IEEE 802.11ad, the IEEE 802.11 Task Group ay has recently defined new PHY and MAC specifications that enable 100 Gb/s communications through a number of technical advancements. In this article, we identify and describe the main design elements of IEEE 802.11ay, including MIMO, channel bonding, improved channel access, and enhanced beamforming training. For each of these elements, we discuss how their design is impacted by mm-Wave radio propagation characteristics and present enabling mechanisms defined in IEEE 802.11ay.",

As with any other communication system, realistic channel models are of critical importance for VLC system design, performance evaluation, and testing. This article presents the reference channel models that were endorsed by the IEEE 802.15.7r1 Task Group for evaluation of VLC system proposals. These were developed for typical indoor environments, including home, office, and manufacturing cells. While highlighting the channel models, we further discuss physical layer techniques potentially considered for IEEE 802.15.7r1.",

   "abstract": "This article describes the concept and composition of the ITU Spectrum Management Training Program (SMTP) that was developed by the International Telecommunication Union and is currently being implemented under the auspices of the ITU Academy. SMTP was designed as a flexible ECTS-based modular framework for professional training that allows various degrees of immersion as well as different specialization paths toward a formal professional certification in the field of radio spectrum management. SMTP offers a solid and holistic system of professional education in both the theoretical and practical aspects of spectrum management as an important standardization activity supporting development of wireless communications. The ITU envisages SMTP eventually becoming a global \"gold standard\" for professional education in the highly specialized field of spectrum management. An essential differentiator for SMTP, compared to the limited offerings currently available for spectrum management training, is the formalized assessment of learning outcomes in terms of obtained professional skills and qualifications. Upon successful completion of SMTP, participants will be awarded a professional qualifications certificate by the ITU Academy or, possibly, a postgraduate professional education diploma of Master of Sciences from a partner university.",

This article provides a general analysis of the IEEE 802.15.7 standard for optical communications using visible light, focusing on the PHY I, intended for outdoor applications. Moreover, the article discusses how the standard's specifications apply to visible light communication use in vehicular networking applications. The article concentrates on the standard's applicability in this domain, and points out the fact that it has not been widely accepted, as most of the VLC developers are focused on decreasing system complexity and implementation costs, rather than complying with the standard's requirements. Furthermore, the article points out the necessity of a novel vehicular applications VLC specific standard, which should focus on the requirements imposed in this specific area.",

   "abstract": "Many people recognise the important role broadcasters have in providing people with an understanding of environmental issues through programs and other content, but broadcasters themselves also have a significant impact on the environment through the process of content creation and distribution. In this article we show how the carbon footprint of broadcasting is larger than most people appreciate, and then, using research undertaken by BBC R&amp;D and its partners, we examine in more detail the pawer consumption of program distribution and viewing on a range of common technology platforms. In conclusion, some thoughts on the challenges facing this industry are shared as well as some suggestions on where efforts might productively be focused in order to reduce broadcasting's carbon footprint.",

   "abstract": "Several popular low-level device-to-device techniques, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct, are seen today as enablers for 5G mobile networks, as the communication infrastructure for future Internet of Things systems. However, most of these technologies do not support direct over-the- air communication between end users/devices. Opportunistic networks propose the use of delay-tolerant and wireless communication over such technologies, toward routing messages between end users. In our previous studies, we have shown how taking advantage of the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure leads to high hit rates and low latency based on the increased wireless range coupled with high bandwidth. In this article, we extend our proposed architecture for covering infrastructure-less environments through a novel mechanism that allows connecting peers through Wi-Fi Direct in a seamless and secure fashion. Furthermore, we emulate real-life user traces to empirically prove that our solution improves hit rate by 13 percent without impacting battery life.",

   "abstract": "In-Flight Broadband Connectivity (IFBC) is a significant open market for mobile network operators, considering that more than 3.3 billion passengers were served by airlines in 2015. On-board broadband services are provided via air-to-ground (A2G) connectivity through direct A2G communication (DA2GC) and satellite A2G communication (SA2GC). Available on-board connectivity systems have significant limitations: high latency in SA2GC and low capacity in DA2GC. The customer expectancy is multi-Mb/s connections in every seat, which leads to capacity requirements of Gb/s to the aircraft. Creation of high capacity IFBC requires a collaborative interaction between different industry partners. For this reason, we investigate A2G architectures in terms of economic and technical perspectives, and propose business models by identifying new roles and positioning them in the A2G business ecosystem. In addition, we provide an extensive summary of the state-of-the-art and future improvements for A2G communications.",

The objective of this article is to address these questions. To do so we review the evolution of eCall, compare approaches developed in different parts of the world, and discuss interoperability between selected systems. This study shows that it is challenging to compare and classify in-vehicle emergency call systems because of different standards, terminologies, and proprietary specifications. We conclude that the NG-911/112 framework provides the building blocks to support next generation eCall, and can contribute to a common standard for the interface between private service centers and public safety answering points.",

   "abstract": "Inband FD operation has great potential in civilian/commercial wireless communications, because it can as much as double transmission links spectral efficiency by exploiting the newfound capability for STAR that is facilitated by advanced SIC techniques. This article surveys the prospects of exploiting the emerging FD radio technology in military communication applications as well. In addition to enabling high-rate twoway tactical communications, the STAR capability could give a major technical advantage to armed forces by allowing their radio transceivers to conduct electronic warfare at the same time that they are also receiving or transmitting other signals at the same frequency bands. After comprehensively introducing FD transceiver architectures and SIC requirements in military communications, this article outlines and analyzes all the most promising defensive and offensive applications of the STAR capability. It is not out of the question that this disruptive technology could even bring about a paradigm shift in operations at the cyber-electromagnetic battleground. At least, forward-looking innovators in the military communications community would right now have a window of opportunity to engage in original, potentially high-impact scientific research on FD military radio systems, which we would like to spur on by this speculative tutorial article.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, \"experiential learning\" as a method of delivering course material has become more recognized in university education. This article is a report on a project conducted in the School of Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University that incorporates experiential learning in a lower division course. The course is a firstyear, common core course in logic circuits. At the time that this project was implemented, the course did not have any lab components attached to it; therefore, incorporating experiential learning into the course was even more challenging. In this article, an example of an assignment given to students that incorporates experiential learning is presented, and the results of students' feedback on this method of learning compared to the conventional method are summarized. A similar approach can be applied to other subjects in engineering, even without requiring a laboratory component in the course. This article also provides example applications for analog and digital communication courses.",

Our control plane is a novel system that extends a TLD operator's traditional services and detects potential threats in the TLD by continuously analyzing the TLD operator's two key datasets: the typically large amounts of DNS traffic that it handles and its database of registered domain names. The control plane shares information on discovered threats with other players in the TLD's ecosystem and can also use it to dynamically scale the TLD operator's DNS infrastructure. The control plane builds on a set of open source modules that we have developed on top of a Hadoop-based data storage cluster. These enable, for example, TLD operators to run and develop threat detectors and to easily import their DNS traffic into the control plane. Our control plane uses policies to protect the privacy of TLD users and is based on our operational experience of running .nl TLD (Netherlands), which we are also using as the use case for our implementation.",

   "abstract": "For decades, instructors and researchers have been trying to improve or enhance the learning process of students. In this process, it is important to know whether students have misconceptions in their conceptual understanding. The study of these elements is becoming a relevant research area in science and engineering education. This article provides insights into why students have misconceptions in an online course on operating systems. Specifically, this study presents a four-year qualitative case study of 78 online students in order to identify misconceptions and the causes that generate them. Our results indicate that students experienced misconceptions with the concept of interrupt. In fact, this study reveals that the natural-language meaning of the term interrupt is a hindrance to understanding this concept. In addition, a methodology for discovering misconceptions and their causes is developed.",

   "abstract": "Point-of-care personalized medicine and home diagnostics are emerging topics that can help to master the challenges of aging societies. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is one of the most promising sensing principles because it enables the detection of proteins, metabolites, and reactive oxygen species, which play crucial roles in a large number of diseases, with high specificity. To provide a self-contained introduction to the topic, this article starts with a description of the basic working principle of magnetic resonance spectroscopy, highlighting the similarities and differences compared to conventional impedance spectroscopy methods. Focusing on the two specific techniques of NMR and ESR spectroscopy, we explain how miniaturized systems co-integrating detectors and the signal processing electronics on a single chip are a key enabler for portable, low-cost spectrometry systems. These systems bear many similarities to conventional communication transceivers and can therefore largely benefit from recent advances in communication circuits as well as entirely new detection principles such as VCObased detection, which are enabled by the use of modern nanometer-scaled integrated circuit technologies. An overview of the current state of the art of such miniaturized magnetic resonance spectrometers is presented, which both highlights the excellent new possibilities associated with these systems and at the same time outlines the current challenges and future research directions in this emerging field of research.",

   "abstract": "Full duplex wireless has drawn significant interest in the recent past due to the potential for doubling network capacity in the physical layer and offering numerous other benefits at higher layers. However, the implementation of integrated full duplex radios is fraught with several fundamental challenges. Achieving the levels of self-interference cancellation required over the wide bandwidths mandated by emerging wireless standards is challenging in an integrated circuit implementation. The dynamic range limitations of integrated electronics restrict the transmitter power levels and receiver noise floor levels that can be supported in integrated full duplex radios. Advances in compact antenna interfaces for full duplex are also required. Finally, networks employing full duplex nodes will require a complete rethinking of the medium access control layer as well as cross-layer interaction and co-design. This article describes recent research results that address these challenges. Several generations of full duplex transceiver ICs are described that feature novel RF self-interference cancellation circuits, antenna cancellation techniques, and a non-magnetic CMOS circulator. Resource allocation algorithms and rate gain/improvement characterizations are also discussed for full duplex configurations involving IC-based nodes.",

Without unifying the access to different kinds of devices, the construction of IoT service systems would be cumbersome. In our work, integrating distributed events into SOA is the basic principle. The data accessing capability of physical entities is separated from their actuation capability, which acts as a foundation for ultra-scale and elastic IoT applications. We then establish a distributed event-based IoT service platform to support IoT service creation and allow for the hiding of service access complexity, where the IoT services are event-driven, and impedance matching between service computation and event communication is the design goal. The coordination logic of an IoT service system is extracted as an event composition, which supports the distributed execution of the system with scalability. We finally implement applications over the platform to show its effectiveness and applicability.",

   "abstract": "Interference alignment has triggered high impact research in wireless communications since it was proposed nearly 10 years ago. However, the vast majority of research is centered on the theory of interference alignment and is hardly feasible in view of the existing state-of-the-art wireless technologies. Although several research groups have assessed the feasibility of interference alignment via testbed measurements in realistic environments, the experimental evaluation of interference alignment is still in its infancy since most of the experiments were limited to simpler scenarios and configurations. This article summarizes the practical limitations of experimentally evaluating interference alignment, provides an overview of the available interference alignment testbed implementations, including the costs, and highlights the imperatives for succeeding interference alignment testbed implementations. Finally, the article explores future research directions on the applications of interference alignment in the next generation wireless systems.",

The appealing IoT services and big data analytics are enabling smart city initiatives all over the world. These services are transforming cities by improving infrastructure and transportation systems, reducing traffic congestion, providing waste management, and improving the quality of human life. In this article, we devise a taxonomy to best bring forth a generic overview of the IoT paradigm for smart cities, integrated ICT, network types, possible opportunities and major requirements. Moreover, an overview of the up-to-date efforts from standard bodies is presented. Later, we give an overview of existing open source IoT platforms for realizing smart city applications followed by several exemplary case studies. In addition, we summarize the latest synergies and initiatives worldwide taken to promote IoT in the context of smart cities. Finally, we highlight several challenges in order to give future research directions.",

   "abstract": "To address the challenge of more spectrum for IoT connectivity, this article proposes an SA framework with rotating radars. The proposed framework is based on the results of our measurement campaign in which we measured spectrum usage patterns and signal characteristics of three different ground-based fixed rotating radar systems near Oulu, Finland. In our work, we review different IoT protocols and their use of licensed or unlicensed spectrum. We make the case that IoT systems generate much data that cannot be accommodated with licensed/unlicensed spectrum, which already suffer from congestion. We identify the suitability of shared access between different rotating radars and IoT networks. We then present a zone-based SA framework in rotating radar spectrum for the operators providing IoT services, highlight its benefits, and also specify challenges in its implementation. To fully develop the considered zone-based SA method that ensures coexistence of IoT devices with no harmful interference to the rotating radars, we propose an REM-enabled architecture for the SA. The proposed architecture provides principles and rules for using the SA for the IoT, and it does not require modifications in the incumbent radar systems.",

   "abstract": "The emerging fog paradigm has been attracting increasing interest from both academia and industry, due to the low-latency, resilient, and cost-effective services it can provide. Many fog applications, such as video mining and event monitoring, rely on data stream processing and analytics, which are very popular in the cloud, but have not been comprehensively investigated in the context of fog architecture. In this article, we present the general models and architecture of fog data streaming, by analyzing the common properties of several typical applications. We also analyze the design space of fog streaming with the consideration of four essential dimensions (system, data, human, and optimization), where both new design challenges and the issues that arise from leveraging existing techniques are investigated, such as cloud stream processing, computer networks, and mobile computing.",

   "abstract": "The technologies associated with the Internet of Things have great potential for application in the domain of food and agriculture, especially in view of the societal and environmental challenges faced by this sector. From farm to fork, IoT technologies could transform the sector, contributing to food safety, and the reduction of agricultural inputs and food waste. A major step toward greater uptake of these technologies will be the execution of IoT-based large-scale pilots (LSPs) in the entire supply chain. This article outlines the challenges and constraints that an LSP deployment of IoT in this domain must consider. Sectoral and technological challenges are described in order to identify a set of technological and agrifood requirements. An architecture based on a system of systems approach is briefly presented, the importance of addressing the interoperability challenges faced by this sector is highlighted, and we elaborate on requirements for new business models, security, privacy, and data governance. A description of the technologies and solutions involved in designing pilots for four agrifood domains (dairy, fruit, arable, meat and vegetable supply chain) is eventually provided. In conclusion, it is noted that for IoT to be successful in this domain, a significant change of culture is needed.",

   "abstract": "With the telecom market reaching saturation in many regions and revenues from voice calls decreasing, telecom operators are attempting to identify new sources of revenue. For this purpose, these operators can take advantage of their core functionalities, such as location and call control, by exposing them as services to be composed by developers with third-party offerings available over the web. Mashups enable technology to compose those services into new applications. However, existing mashup tools have some limitations in such convergent web-service-based integration, such as extra programming efforts for ordinary users. To address these limitations, we propose a novel LSMP, which includes the SDM, SRM, SCM, and SEM. The SDM defines a unified structure for atom-services to reduce the development complexity. The SRM defines a structurized data flow to reduce the coupling of data transfer between atom-services. The SCM provides a design method for the service process, with key data as the driving characteristic. The SEM provides a container for the service logic execution. With these models, ordinary users can create new personalized services freely via an intuitive and easy-to-use UI on a web browser.",

In this article, we describe best practices for meeting the challenging coexistence, harmonic management, linearity, and efficiency performance related to the functional partitioning, optimized integration, and technology selection of the RFFE. Recent trends to improve radio performance are driving specific blocks (e.g., the low noise amplifier) into the RFFE, with associated architecture changes in both primary and diversity paths. Carrier aggregation features are supported in a number of different methods with different insertion loss, isolation, and noise figure trade-offs, and here we examine benefits of a new category of highly integrated diversity receive modules to enhance receiver sensitivity across all use cases. Movement toward higher order MIMO in the DL is compounding additional RF Rx path support and requirements, and cost-effective solutions for optimum performance trade-offs require a holistic and complete RF system view of both Tx and Rx in order to address these emerging requirements.",

   "abstract": "Massive MTC over cellular networks is expected to be an integral part of wireless smart city applications. The LTE/LTE-A technology is a major candidate for provisioning of MTC applications. However, due to the diverse characteristics of payload size, transmission periodicity, power efficiency, and QoS requirement, MTC poses huge challenges to LTE/LTE-A technologies. In particular, efficient management of massive random access is one of the most critical challenges. In the case of massive random access attempts, the probability of preamble collision drastically increases, and thus the performance of LTE/LTE-A random access degrades sharply. In this context, this article reviews the current state-of-the-art proposals to control massive random access of MTC devices in LTE/LTE-A networks. The proposals are compared in terms of five major metrics: access delay, access success rate, power efficiency, QoS guarantee, and the effect on HTC. To this end, we propose a novel collision resolution random access model for massive MTC over LTE/LTE-A. Our proposed model basically resolves the preamble collisions instead of avoidance and targets the management of massive and bursty access attempts. Simulations of our proposed model show huge improvements in random access success rate compared to the standard slotted-Aloha- based models. The new model can also coexist with existing LTE/LTE-A MAC protocol and ensure high reliability and time-efficient network access.",

   "abstract": "VLC is an emerging optical wireless communication technology that can be added as a complementary feature into existing lighting infrastructures for alleviating pressure on the rapidly dwindling radio frequency spectrum. Although LEDs have been traditionally used as transmitters in VLC, the growing urgency for higher data rates in the gigabit class range has deviated focus toward the consideration of LDs as potential sources for VLC due to their unique features of high modulation bandwidth, efficiency, and beam convergence. This article focuses on the principles of LD-based VLC systems, highlighting the operational characteristics and link configurations. The unique features of LDs compared to LEDs are discussed alongside the communication and illumination aspects of different classifications of LD-VLC. The challenges in terms of practical implementation and the potential applications that might arise from this communication technology are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "A cloud radio access network deployed on top of edge networks as a software-defined radio access network architecture has been regarded as a promising paradigm for the next generation mobile networks, but it has not received considerable attention in the vehicular industry due to distinct design needs. For mobile networks, infrastructures provide powerful computation capability for universal radio resource optimization, and therefore an inherent \"cloud-down\" design is favorable. On the contrary, to deploy vehicular technologies, sophisticated processing capability has been a baseline feature for the next generation driving machines, which may not solely rely on wireless infrastructures to guarantee driving safety, so an \"edge-up\" design is preferred. Consequently, this article surveys the recent works on software-defined vehicular networks and proposes a series of edge-up software-defined networking designs, particularly emphasizing the most crucial function of latency control to support possible wireless applications for the next generation driving machines. The proposed designs thus create a paradigm shift to enable software-defined mobileedge vehicular networking.",

   "abstract": "Mobile communications are today widespread and contribute to the development of our society. Every day new devices include some means of wireless transmission, which is becoming ubiquitous with the Internet of Things. These systems are standardized by international organizations such as the IEEE, 3GPP, and ETSI, among others. Even though knowledge of wireless standards is key to the understanding of these systems, wireless communications are quite often taught in engineering degrees in a traditional way, without much emphasis on the standardization. Moreover, strong focus is often placed on the theoretical performance analysis rather than on practical implementation aspects. In contrast, most of the current applications make extensive use of mobile data, and the global users' satisfaction is highly correlated with the mobile data throughput. Thus, modern wireless engineers need to have deep insight on the standards that define the mobile transmission systems, and this knowledge is not acquired following the traditional theoretical teaching schemes. In this article, a new learning approach is described. This novel paradigm is based on a new flexible hardware/software platform (FRAMED-SOFT), which is also detailed. Although the article is focused on two wireless standards, GSM and UMTS, the work discussed in this article can easily be extended to other standards of interest, such as LTE and beyond, WiFi, and WiMAX.",

   "abstract": "Distribution of live multimedia streams to a high number of end users through an ISP network may be efficiently implemented through IP multicasting. Multicast traffic engineering with traditional decentralized approaches, however, is still a challenging problem for network operators. In this article we present a centralized approach to management of source-specific multicast traffic flows relying on software defined networking. Our approach is suitable for hybrid IP/SDN networks, where network nodes behave as traditional IP routers by default, but whose packet forwarding behavior may be customized for specific flows thanks to an OpenFlow-enabled control plane. We also describe a traffic management system that we implemented as a proof of concept, which can be used by an ISP to compute multicast distribution trees for a given set of channels to be distributed to their customers.",

   "abstract": "With mobility as the dominant theme in the emerging fabric of IoE (Internet of Everything), a prolific demand for capacity is a natural consequence. Throughput, latency reduction, availability and reliability are elemental attributes of experientially attractive and robust mobile multimedia services. These elemental attributes drive the demand for spectrum. The use of E-UTRA (Enhanced-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) technologies, specified under the LTE project, over the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum, is being considered as a forward-looking approach for standardization to meet the growing capacity demands to support mobile multimedia services. The 5 GHz spectrum band also includes the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, which is utilized by the IEEE 802 family of technologies. LAA (license assisted access) refers to the use of LTE technologies over unlicensed spectrum, with assistance using a licensed radio frequency carrier. A significant challenge in the standardization of LAA for interoperability is the management of co-channel and adjacent channel interference, when both E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies share the same unlicensed spectrum. These challenges are compounded by the differences in the regulations across the three different global ITU (International Telecommunication Union) regions (Europe, Americas, and Asia.) This article will identify strategies and corresponding trade-offs to mitigate the coexistence challenges between the E-UTRA and the IEEE family of technologies, utilizing forward-looking and interoperable enablers. In conclusion, the article will delineate recommendations for a realization of CA (carrier aggregation) between licensed and unlicensed spectrum for downlink and uplink, to accomplish deployment-specific capacity enhancements.",

   "abstract": "3D imaging technologies are applied in numerous areas, including self-driving cars, drones, and robots, and in advanced industrial, medical, scientific, and consumer applications. 3D imaging is usually accomplished by finding the distance to multiple points on an object or in a scene, and then creating a point cloud of those range measurements. Different methods can be used for the ranging. Some of these methods, such as stereovision, rely on processing 2D images. Other techniques estimate the distance more directly by measuring the round-trip delay of an ultrasonic or electromagnetic wave to the object. Ultrasonic waves suffer large losses in air and cannot reach distances beyond a few meters. Radars and lidars use electromagnetic waves in radio and optical spectra, respectively. The shorter wavelengths of the optical waves compared to the radio frequency waves translates into better resolution, and a more favorable choice for 3D imaging. The integration of lidars on electronic and photonic chips can lower their cost, size, and power consumption, making them affordable and accessible to all the abovementioned applications. This review article explains different lidar aspects and design choices, such as optical modulation and detection techniques, and point cloud generation by means of beam-steering or flashing an entire scene. Popular lidar architectures and circuits are presented, and the superiority of the FMCW lidar is discussed in terms of range resolution, receiver sensitivity, and compatibility with emerging technologies. At the end, an electronic-photonic integrated circuit for a micro-imaging FMCW lidar is presented as an example.",

   "abstract": "In order to provide higher data rates and to improve radio spectrum utilization, 3GPP has introduced the concept of CA in its Release 10 and onward commonly known as LTE-Advanced. The CA technology, particularly when applied in a noncontiguous manner, poses serious design and implementation challenges for radio transceivers, mainly due to the allowed flexibility in the transmitted signal characteristics and the nonlinear RF components in the TX and RX chains. As a consequence, substantial nonlinear distortion may occur that not only degrades the transmitted signal quality but can also affect the concurrent operation of the coexisting receiver when operating in the FDD mode. In this article, the key technical design challenges in terms of linearity requirements for LTE-Advanced mobile terminals are reviewed, and the corresponding self-interference problem related to the potential desensitization of the device's own receiver is highlighted. Then technical solutions to mitigate the self-interference at the RX band due to a nonlinear PA in the transmitter chain are reviewed, with specific emphasis on digital self-interference cancellation methods. As demonstrated through simulation and actual RF measurement examples, the cancellation solutions can substantially mitigate the RX desensitization problem, thus relaxing the RF isolation requirements between the TX and RX chains. Such cancellation methods are one potential enabling technique toward the full exploitation of the fragmented RF spectrum and the CA technology in future LTE-Advanced and beyond mobile networks<sup>.</sup>",

   "abstract": "Load-stress test is the experimental performance analysis in extreme traffic and density conditions, routinely required to validate any innovative radio access solution. This article focuses on load-stress test specifically designed for the two-hop architecture that enables the onboard connectivity in HSTs. The load-stress condition of train-to-infrastructure communication for a massive number of onboard UEs is very challenging, as it needs to account for extreme conditions and a complex testing environment. The load-stress method proposed in this article is for a ground network supporting onboard wireless connectivity in HSTs, and is validated for commercial eNBs from LTE cellular networks (Rel-11). The in-lab experimental setup is arranged by virtualizing multiple eNBs serving multiple cells, arranged sequentially along a line to simulate the HST track with a massive number of active onboard UEs. The focus of the experimental load-stress test is the analysis of the impact of Doppler shift and interruptions caused by the frequent HOs of multiple consecutive groups of UEs deployed in HST carriages at the speed of 300 km/h. The HO interruption time is characterized statistically based on the number of active UEe. The consequent impairments on the experienced QoS for high-throughput and low-latency services such as FTP and VoLTE are verified. This article validates experimentally the traffic and HO latency improvements (approximately threefold) in a multi-cell access scheme when the coverage of every single carriage is augmented by fixed directional antennas to offload UEs toward far-away eNBs along the train track.",

   "abstract": "A new breed of wireless technologies has emerged under the generic name of low-power, wide-area (LPWA), with a number of common characteristics that make these technologies uniquely suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These common characteristics include a power-optimized radio network, a simplified network topology, frame sizes in the order of tens of bytes transmitted a few times per day at ultralow speeds, and a mostly upstream transmission pattern that allows the devices to spend most of their time in low-energy deep-sleep mode. These characteristics enable a range of several kilometers and long battery lifetimes, possibly ten years of operation on a single coin-cell. It also enables simple and scalable deployments with low-cost devices and thin infrastructures.",

Unlike human-tohuman communication, distinct features of M2M traffic necessitates specialized and interoperable communication technologies. However, most existing solutions offering wired or wireless connectivity have limitations that hinder widespread horizons of M2M applications. To cope with the peculiar nature of M2M traffic, the evolving 5G system considers the integration of key enabling networking technologies for ubiquitous connectivity and guaranteed QoS. This study outlines the state-of-the-art architecture, recent advances, and open research challenges in communication technologies for M2M. Also, an overview of considerable architectural enhancements and novel techniques expected in 5G networks is presented, followed by the resultant services and benefits for M2M communications.",

   "abstract": "Foreseen 5G verticals hold the promise of being true value-added services, hence bringing significant income to their respective providers. However, the nature of these verticals are very demanding in terms of both economic and technical requirements, such as multi-operator cooperation, end-to-end quality assurance, and the unified orchestration of network and cloud resources. Existing systems fall short of satisfying these requirements, but emerging network softwarization and resource virtualization technologies, such as SDN and NFV, show promise for being key enablers in this context. In this article, we introduce the 5G Exchange (5GEx) concept that builds on SDN and NFV, and facilitates the provisioning of multi-operator 5G services by means of inter-operator management and orchestration of virtualized network, compute, and storage resources. We present potential 5GEx use cases, conceptual architecture, and value proposition. We also outline open research questions on how to exchange information in such a coopetitive environment, and provide an outlook on the impact of 5GEx on a network service provider's business and operation.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things promises ubiquitous connectivity of everything everywhere, which represents the biggest technology trend in the years to come. It is expected that by 2020 over 25 billion devices will be connected to cellular networks; far beyond the number of devices in current wireless networks. Machine-to-machine communications aims to provide the communication infrastructure for enabling IoT by facilitating the billions of multi-role devices to communicate with each other and with the underlying data transport infrastructure without, or with little, human intervention. Providing this infrastructure will require a dramatic shift from the current protocols mostly designed for human-to-human applications. This article reviews recent 3GPP solutions for enabling massive cellular IoT and investigates the random access strategies for M2M communications, which shows that cellular networks must evolve to handle the new ways in which devices will connect and communicate with the system. A massive non-orthogonal multiple access technique is then presented as a promising solution to support a massive number of IoT devices in cellular networks, where we also identify its practical challenges and future research directions.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things has been widely deployed in various areas of daily life through heterogeneous communications protocols. Each unstandardized protocol focuses on a specific IoT communication pattern. Inspired by the Internet architecture over which divergent devices can easily be accessed and a considerable number of applications can be run, we propose a generic architecture for IoT. This architecture supports two DIY areas: network DIY for data aggregation and application DIY for service cooperation. To connect these two DIYs, a centralized controller has been designed to provide standardized interfaces for data acquisition, organization, and storage, and to support elastic and supportive computing. With these properties, divergent devices can coexist in a uniform microworld, and rich services can be developed and provided on demand to interoperate with physical devices. This article discusses the background, design principles, and advantages of the proposed architecture, as well as open problems and our initial solution, which substantiates a novel IoT architecture and new research ground.",

   "abstract": "Configuring the antenna arrays is the main source of overhead in mmWave communication systems. In high mobility scenarios, the problem is exacerbated, as achieving the highest rates requires frequent link reconfiguration. One solution is to exploit spatial congruence between signals in different frequency bands and extract mmWave channel parameters with the aid of side information obtained in another band. In this article we propose the concept of out-of-band information aided mmWave communication. We analyze different strategies to leverage information derived from sensors or from other communication systems operating at sub-6 GHz bands to help configure the mmWave communication link. The overhead reductions that can be obtained when exploiting out-of-band information are characterized in a preliminary study. Finally, the challenges associated with using out-of-band signals as a source of side information at mmWave are analyzed in detail.",

   "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are a rising technology in the near future to provide a safe and efficient transportation experience. Vehicular communication systems are indispensable components in autonomous vehicles to share road conditions in a wireless manner. With the exponential increase of traffic data, conventional wireless technologies preliminarily show their incompetence because of limited bandwidth. This article explores the capability of millimeter-wave communications for autonomous vehicles. As the next-generation wireless technology, mmWave is advanced in its multi-gigabit transmittability and beamforming technique. Based on these features, we propose the novel design of a vehicular mmWave system combining the advantages of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. This mmWave system supports vehicles sharing multi-gigabit data about the surrounding environment and recognizing objects via the cloud in real time. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are able to determine the optimal driving strategy instantaneously.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing is a new paradigm, sharing sensing data collected by mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. As mobile devices are usually connected by an opportunistic network for data transfer, it is hard to acknowledge the contribution of each mobile user in network forwarding and find a sustainable incentive mechanism. In this article, we propose a software defined opportunistic network scheme for mobile crowdsensing. We design a centralized control structure to manage the opportunistic network and mobile crowdsensing. By the centralized structure, we also design an incentive mechanism for data forwarding and collection in a software defined opportunistic network and solve the optimal decision of mobile devices and the sensing service provider. From the extensive simulation results, our incentive mechanism performs better than original solutions.",

   "abstract": "The expected stringent requirements of future 5G networks such as ultra-low latency, user experience continuity, and high reliability will drive the need for highly localized services within RANs in close proximity to mobile subscribers. In light of this, the mobile edge computing (MEC) concept has emerged, which aims to unite telco, IT, and cloud computing to deliver cloud services directly from the network edge. To facilitate better understanding of MEC, this article first discusses its potential service scenarios and identifies design challenges of MEC-enabled networks. Given the importance of scaling up research in the area of network integration and convergence in support of MEC toward 5G, the article explores the possibilities of empowering integrated fiber-wireless (FiWi) access networks to offer MEC capabilities. More specifically, envisioned design scenarios of MEC over FiWi networks for typical RAN technologies (i.e., WLAN, 4G LTE, LTE-A HetNets) are investigated, accounting for both network architecture and enhanced resource management. The performance of MEC over Ethernet-based FiWi networks in terms of delay, response time efficiency, and battery life of edge devices is then analyzed. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MEC over FiWi concept.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes an approach to enhance users' experience of video streaming in the context of smart cities. The proposed approach relies on the concept of MEC as a key factor in enhancing QoS. It sustains QoS by ensuring that applications/services follow the mobility of users, realizing the \"Follow Me Edge\" concept. The proposed scheme enforces an autonomic creation of MEC services to allow anywhere anytime data access with optimum QoE and reduced latency. Considering its application in smart city scenarios, the proposed scheme represents an important solution for reducing core network traffic and ensuring ultra-short latency through a smart MEC architecture capable of achieving the 1 ms latency dream for the upcoming 5G mobile systems.",

   "abstract": "The increasing popularity and usage of portable smart devices have heightened the demand for higher data rates and mobility support in wireless communication networks. Many portable device users rely heavily on public transport during their trips to work, school, and other business locations. To facilitate the provision of high data rates for these commuters, the development of innovative wireless technologies is critical. Small cell networks can be a promising solution to this challenge. However, incorporating small cells in vehicular environments demands further investigation, especially for issues related to their communication architecture, interference and resource management. In this article, we present a small cell network system design that can provide seamless high data rate services to public transport users. We address the frequency allocation problem for mobile small cells and introduce time-varying frequency allocation solutions to meet the dynamic network topology and varying user traffic requirements.",

   "abstract": "Full-duplex technique is considered as an essential component of the coming 5G wireless systems. Since the SI from its transmit antennas dominates over the signal received from remote sites, the suppression of SI is the first priority challenge in the design of FD systems, and thus combinations of analog SI cancellation with radio frequency domain approaches are considered. Applying BF techniques with multiple antennas on top of these combined approaches can further strengthen the SI suppression capability so that wireless systems can enjoy the benefit from FD operation without much concern on SI. However, various factors affect the design of BF in FD networks, and hence they provide a set of research challenges. Also, S-ER is an alternative way of utilizing SI in FD networks, where the RF radiation from a node is reused as an energy source. In this article, we go through these opportunities and challenges along with a survey of technical results developed so far in regard to the BF for handling the SI of FD systems. We look at various network models, the strategies for handling the SI, relay protocols, and antenna structure to see how these provide technical challenges for the BF design.",

This article discusses the potential applications and recent work about SC and observes two issues regarding green SC. Further, motivated by solving these two issues, this article proposes a Multi-Method Data Delivery (MMDD) scheme for SC users. MMDD strategically incorporates four kinds of delivery: delivery from cloud to SC users; delivery from WSN to SC users; delivery from SC users to SC users; and delivery from cloudlet to SC users. Compared to exclusive data delivery from cloud to SC users, evaluation results show that MMDD could achieve lower delivery cost or less delivery time for SC users.",

In such a system, multiple types of services coexist in one baseband system with each service having its optimal frame structure and low out-of-band emission waveforms operating on the service frequency band to reduce the ISvcBI. In this article, a framework for a multi-service system is established, and the challenges and possible solutions are studied. The multi-service system implementation in both the time and frequency domains is discussed. Two representative SFMC waveforms, F-OFDM and UFMC, are considered in this article. Specifically, the design methodology, criteria, orthogonality conditions, and prospective application scenarios in the context of 5G are discussed. We consider both SR and MR signal processing methods. Compared to the SR system, the MR system has significantly reduced computational complexity at the expense of performance loss due to ISubBI in MR systems. The ISvcBI and ISubBI in MR systems are investigated with proposed low-complexity interference cancellation algorithms to enable multi-service operation in low interference level conditions.",

   "abstract": "Telecommunication standards are documents that contain consolidated knowledge about communication systems and implementation best practices. They are created based on long consensus processes in order to meet practical constraints. This article describes how the DVB-S2 standard is used in the electrical engineering curricula at KU Leuven within a design and implementation course called EAGLE. The goal of the course is to teach third-year Bachelor students how to apply the abstract knowledge gathered in the theoretical courses (control theory, communication theory, software, and hardware) to the design of a complex and real engineering project. Based on their progress during the academic year, we illustrate how standards can be used to teach a broad skill set and act as an accelerator to abstract system implementation complexity. We give an overview of the objectives of the EAGLE project and the relevance of the DVB-S2 standard, the design and implementation task that the students need to accomplish, and how they finally learn to master the complexity of a real communication standard, VHDL coding, and system verification and integration.",

   "abstract": "NATs are commonplace in the Internet nowadays. It is fair to say that most residential and mobile users are connected to the Internet through one or more NATs. As with any other technology, NAT presents upsides and downsides. Probably the most acknowledged downside of the NAT technology is that it introduces additional difficulties for some applications such as peer-to-peer applications, gaming, and others to function properly. This is partially due to the nature of the NAT technology but also due to the diversity of behaviors of the different NAT implementations deployed in the Internet. Understanding the properties of the currently deployed NAT base provides useful input for application and protocol developers regarding what to expect when deploying new applications in the Internet. The goal of this article is to identify common NAT profiles in order to provide an overview of the current behavior of NATs. We develop NATwatcher, a tool to test NAT boxes using a crowdsourcing- based measurement methodology. We perform a large measurement campaign using NATwatcher recruiting over 700 users, from 65 different countries and 280 ISPs. We present the results after testing and profiling NAT products from over 120 vendors.",

   "abstract": "The sockets API has become the standard way that applications access the transport services offered by the IP stack. This article presents NEAT, a user space library that can provide an alternate transport API. NEAT allows applications to request the service they need using a new design that is agnostic to the specific choice of transport protocol underneath. This not only allows applications to take advantage of common protocol machinery, but also eases introduction of new network mechanisms and transport protocols. The article describes the components of the NEAT library and illustrates the important benefits that can be gained from this new approach. NEAT is a software platform for developing advanced network applications that was designed in accordance with the standardization efforts on transport services in the IETF, but its features exceed the envisioned functionality of a TAPS system.",

Designing NFV management and orchestration to provide dynamic SFC as a service is addressed by the proposed NFV orchestration framework.1 The framework is designed to facilitate the development of NFV architecture components with a focus on SFC orchestration, placement algorithms, required monitoring, and network services stitching. The proposed framework can be used to compare placement algorithms as well as develop and evaluate other service function chaining solutions using a variety of SDN controllers to interact with heterogeneous underlying networking technologies.

NR will enable new use cases, requiring further enhanced data rates, latency, coverage, capacity, and reliability. This needs to be accomplished with improved network energy performance and the ability to exploit spectrum in very high frequency bands. Key technology components to reach these targets include flexible numerology, latency-optimized frame structure, massive MIMO, interworking between high and low frequency bands, and ultra-lean transmissions. Preliminary evaluations indicate that, with these technology components, NR can reach the 5G targets.",

   "abstract": "Named data networking and software defined networking share mutual courage in changing legacy networking architectures. In the case of NDN, IP-based communication has been tackled by naming the data or content itself, while SDN proposes to decouple the control and data planes to make various services manageable without physical interference with switches and routers. Both NDN and SDN also support communication via heterogeneous interfaces and have been recently investigated for vehicular networks. Naive VNs are based on the IP-based legacy, which is prone to several issues due to the dynamic network topology among other factors. In this article, we first see both SDN and NDN enabled VNs from a bird's eye view, and for the very first time, we present an architecture that combines SDN functionalities within VNs to retrieve the required content using NDN. Moreover, we discuss a number of current research challenges and provide a precise roadmap that can be considered for the research community to jointly address such challenges.",

   "abstract": "Piggyback crowdsensing (PCS) is a novel energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing paradigm that reduces the energy consumption of crowdsensing tasks by leveraging smartphone app opportunities (SAOs). This article, based on several fundamental assumptions of incentive payment for PCS task participation and spatial-temporal coverage assessment for collected sensor data, first proposes two alternating data collection goals. Goal 1 is maximizing overall spatial-temporal coverage under a predefined incentive budget constraint; goal 2 is minimizing total incentive payment while ensuring predefined spatial-temporal coverage for collected sensor data, all on top of the PCS task model. With all of the above assumptions, settings, and models, we introduce CrowdMind - a generic incentive allocation framework for the two optimal data collection goals, on top of the PCS model. We evaluated CrowdMind extensively using a large-scale real-world SAO dataset for the two incentive allocation problems. The results demonstrate that compared to baseline algorithms, CrowdMind achieves better spatial-temporal coverage under the same incentive budget constraint, while costing less in total incentive payments and ensuring the same spatial-temporal coverage, under various coverage/incentive settings. Further, a short theoretical analysis is presented to analyze the performance of CrowdMind in terms of the optimization with total incentive cost and overall spatial-temporal coverage objectives/constraints.",

   "abstract": "Besides advanced telecommunications techniques, the most prominent evolution of wireless networks is the densification of network deployment. In particular, the increasing access point/ user density and reduced cell size significantly enhance spatial reuse, thereby improving network capacity. Nevertheless, does network ultra-densification and over-deployment always boost the performance of wireless networks? Since the distance from transmitters to receivers is greatly reduced in dense networks, signal is more likely to be propagated from long- to short-range distance. Without considering short-range propagation features, conventional understanding of network densification becomes doubtful. In this regard, it is imperative to reconsider the pros and cons brought by network densification. In this article, we first discuss the short-range propagation features in densely deployed networks and verify through experimental results the validity of the proposed short-range propagation model. Considering short-range propagation, we further explore the fundamental impact of network densification on network capacity, aided by which a concrete interpretation of ultra-densification is presented from the network capacity perspective. Meanwhile, as short-range propagation makes interference more complicated and difficult to handle, we discuss possible approaches to further enhance network capacity in ultra-dense wireless networks. Moreover, key challenges are presented to suggest future directions.",

   "abstract": "Service providers and vendors are moving toward a network virtualized core, whereby multiple applications would be treated on their own merit in programmable hardware. Such a network would have the advantage of being customized for user requirements and allow provisioning of next generation services that are built specifically to meet user needs. In this article, we articulate the impact of network virtualization on networks that provide customized services and how a provider's business can grow with network virtualization. We outline a decision map that allows mapping of applications with technology that is supported in network-virtualization--oriented equipment. Analogies to the world of virtual machines and generic virtualization show that hardware supporting network virtualization will facilitate new customer needs while optimizing the provider network from the cost and performance perspectives. A key conclusion of the article is that growth would yield sizable revenue when providers plan ahead in terms of supporting network-virtualization-oriented technology in their networks. To be precise, providers have to incorporate into their growth plans network elements capable of new service deployments while protecting network neutrality. A simulation study validates our NV-induced model.",

   "abstract": "In the last few years, we have seen an exponential increase in the number of Internet-enabled devices, which has resulted in popularity of fog and cloud computing among end users. End users expect high data rates coupled with secure data access for various applications executed either at the edge (fog computing) or in the core network (cloud computing). However, the bidirectional data flow between the end users and the devices located at either the edge or core may cause congestion at the cloud data centers, which are used mainly for data storage and data analytics. The high mobility of devices (e.g., vehicles) may also pose additional challenges with respect to data availability and processing at the core data centers. Hence, there is a need to have most of the resources available at the edge of the network to ensure the smooth execution of end-user applications. Considering the challenges of future user demands, we present an architecture that integrates cloud and fog computing in the 5G environment that works in collaboration with the advanced technologies such as SDN and NFV with the NSC model. The NSC service model helps to automate the virtual resources by chaining in a series for fast computing in both computing technologies. The proposed architecture also supports data analytics and management with respect to device mobility. Moreover, we also compare the core and edge computing with respect to the type of hypervisors, virtualization, security, and node heterogeneity. By focusing on nodes' heterogeneity at the edge or core in the 5G environment, we also present security challenges and possible types of attacks on the data shared between different devices in the 5G environment.",

   "abstract": "5G networks are expected to be able to satisfy users' different QoS requirements. Network slicing is a promising technology for 5G networks to provide services tailored for users' specific QoS demands. Driven by the increased massive wireless data traffic from different application scenarios, efficient resource allocation schemes should be exploited to improve the flexibility of network resource allocation and capacity of 5G networks based on network slicing. Due to the diversity of 5G application scenarios, new mobility management schemes are greatly needed to guarantee seamless handover in network-slicing-based 5G systems. In this article, we introduce a logical architecture for network-slicing-based 5G systems, and present a scheme for managing mobility between different access networks, as well as a joint power and subchannel allocation scheme in spectrum-sharing two-tier systems based on network slicing, where both the co-tier interference and cross-tier interference are taken into account. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme can flexibly allocate network resources between different slices in 5G systems. Finally, several open issues and challenges in network-slicing-based 5G networks are discussed, including network reconstruction, network slicing management, and cooperation with other 5G technologies.",

   "abstract": "The fifth generation of mobile communications is anticipated to open up innovation opportunities for new industries such as vertical markets. However, these verticals originate myriad use cases with diverging requirements that future 5G networks have to efficiently support. Network slicing may be a natural solution to simultaneously accommodate, over a common network infrastructure, the wide range of services that vertical- specific use cases will demand. In this article, we present the network slicing concept, with a particular focus on its application to 5G systems. We start by summarizing the key aspects that enable the realization of so-called network slices. Then we give a brief overview on the SDN architecture proposed by the ONF and show that it provides tools to support slicing. We argue that although such architecture paves the way for network slicing implementation, it lacks some essential capabilities that can be supplied by NFV. Hence, we analyze a proposal from ETSI to incorporate the capabilities of SDN into the NFV architecture. Additionally, we present an example scenario that combines SDN and NFV technologies to address the realization of network slices. Finally, we summarize the open research issues with the purpose of motivating new advances in this field.",

Slicing a single physical network into multiple isolated logical networks has emerged as a key to realizing this vision. This article is meant to act as a survey, the first to the authors' knowledge, on this topic of prime interest. We begin by reviewing the state of the art in 5G network slicing and present a framework for bringing together and discussing existing work in a holistic manner. Using this framework, we evaluate the maturity of current proposals and identify a number of open research questions.",

   "abstract": "Network slicing has been advocated by both academia and industry as a cost-efficient way to enable operators to provide networks on an as-a-service basis and meet the wide range of use cases that the fifth generation wireless network will serve. The existing works on network slicing are mainly targeted at the partition of the core network, and the prospect of network slicing in radio access networks should be jointly exploited. To solve this challenge, enhanced network slicing in F-RANs, called access slicing, is proposed. This article comprehensively presents a novel architecture and related key techniques for access slicing in F-RANs. The proposed hierarchical architecture of access slicing consists of a centralized orchestration layer and a slice instance layer, which makes access slicing adaptively implementable in a convenient way. Meanwhile, key techniques and their corresponding solutions, including radio and cache resource management as well as social-aware slicing, are presented. Open issues in terms of standardization developments and field trials are identified.",

We elaborate on the challenges that emerge when designing 5G networks based on network slicing. We focus on the architectural aspects associated with the coexistence of dedicated as well as shared slices in the network. In particular, we analyze the realization options of a flexible radio access network with focus on network slicing and their impact on the design of 5G mobile networks. In addition to the technical study, this article provides an investigation of the revenue potential of network slicing, where the applications that originate from this concept and the profit capabilities from the network operator's perspective are put forward.",

With the ubiquitous Internet-of-the-Things technologies including vehicle- to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technologies, the nexus of the Internet, EVs, charging stations, and smart grid forms a perfect storm of opportunities for future green and intelligent transportation systems. In this new paradigm, reliable and efficient information exchanges between EVs, meters, charging stations and the power grid, as well as intelligent charging services, are key issues. To address these issues, this article promotes a hybrid vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication network design. Facilitated by ubiquitous communication systems, how to efficiently and effectively manage EV charging services in both the charging station scenario and the distributed home charging scenario is discussed. Then, open research issues related to the communication technologies and charging services for networked EVs are summarized. Ultimately, networked EVs may not only revolutionize how people and goods move, but also how energy flows, leading to future green and intelligent transportation systems of both things and energy.",

   "abstract": "Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential enabler for the development of 5G and beyond wireless networks. By allowing multiple users to share the same time and frequency, NOMA can scale up the number of served users, increase spectral efficiency, and improve user-fairness compared to existing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. While single-cell NOMA has drawn significant attention recently, much less attention has been given to multi-cell NOMA. This article discusses the opportunities and challenges of NOMA in a multi-cell environment. As the density of base stations and devices increases, inter-cell interference becomes a major obstacle in multi-cell networks. As such, identifying techniques that combine interference management approaches with NOMA is of great significance. After discussing the theory behind NOMA, this article provides an overview of the current literature and discusses key implementation and research challenges, with an emphasis on multi-cell NOMA.",

   "abstract": "One of the promising technologies for Long Term Evolution is full-duplex radio, an innovation that is expected to double spectral efficiency. To realize full-duplex in practice, the main challenge is overcoming self-interference, and to do so, researchers have developed self-interference cancellation techniques. Since most wireless transceivers use power amplifiers, especially in cellular systems, researchers have revealed the importance of nonlinear self-interference cancellation. In this article, we first explore several nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation techniques. We then propose a low-complexity pre-calibration- based nonlinear digital self-interference cancellation technique. Next, we discuss the issues about reference signal allocation and the overhead of each technique. For performance evaluations, we carry out extensive measurements through a real-time prototype and link-/system-level simulations. For link-level analysis, we measure the amount of cancelled self-interference for each technique. We also evaluate system-level performance through 3D ray-tracing-based simulations. Numerical results confirm the significant performance improvement over a half-duplex system even in interference-limited indoor environments.",

   "abstract": "Route diversity in networks is elemental for establishing reliable, high-capacity connections with appropriate security between endpoints. As for the Internet, route diversity has already been studied at both the autonomous system and router level topologies by means of graph theoretical disjoint paths. In this article we complement these approaches by proposing a method for measuring the diversity of Internet paths in a geographical sense. By leveraging the recent developments in IP geolocation we show how to map the paths discovered by traceroute into geographically equivalent classes. This allows us to identify the geographical footprints of the major transmission paths between end-hosts, and building on our observations, we propose a quantitative measure for geographical diversity of Internet routes between any two hosts.",

   "abstract": "Nowadays, a great part of Internet content is not reachable from search engines. Studying the nature of these contents from a cyber security perspective is of high interest, as they could be part of many malware distribution processes, child pornography or copyrighted material exchange, botnet command and control messages, and so on. Although the research community has put a lot of effort into this challenge, most of the existing works are focused on contents that are hidden in websites. However, there are other relevant services that are used to keep and transmit hidden resources, such as P2P protocols. In the present work, we suggest the concept of Deep Torrent to refer to those torrents available in BitTorrent that cannot be found by means of public websites or search engines. We present an implementation of a complete system to crawl the Deep Torrent and evaluate its existence and size. We describe a basic experiment crawling the Deep Torrent for 39 days, in which an initial estimation of its size is 67 percent of the total number of resources shared in the BitTorrent network.",

   "abstract": "Network functions virtualization is an emerging technology that can significantly improve the flexibility of network service provisioning and offer potential cost savings. However, it is critical that service providers offer high reliability and availability of the network and services when moving from proprietary hardware appliances to virtualized network functions on commodity servers. In a network consisting of physical appliances, providers can deploy redundant hardware and extra capacity to handle failures, although this is quite expensive in practice. Virtualization of network functions lead to more challenges for resiliency, but also bring new opportunities to address these challenges in a more cost-effective manner. In this article, we explain the resiliency requirements for virtual network functions in order to provide carrier grade services, summarize the existing solutions in the literature, highlight several research challenges, and present a concrete case study to demonstrate how to decompose a type of virtual router and thus enhance its resiliency.",

   "abstract": "The global mobile traffic is growing exponentially, and currently more than 90 percent of the internet traffic depends on TCP for reliable transmission. However, it is well known that TCP performs quite poorly over unreliable wireless networks, while its dynamic TCP flow control is sensitive to congestion events and tends to underutilize the available network capacity. Despite these known limitations, the industry believes that significant network performance enhancement can be achieved through TCP optimization, and in particular through solutions centered on Split-TCP. In this article we share a sample of TCP throughput performance measurements after implementing Split-TCP on commercial 4G LTE and 3G networks. Experimental results show that Split-TCP provides average TCP throughput gains on the order of 60 percent over a 4G LTE network and on the order of 5 percent over a 3G network. Furthermore, TCP throughput gains superior to 200 percent were measured for individual TCP connections over the 4G LTE network. We expect such throughput gains to be even greater when advanced radio technologies, such as 5G, are deployed. For these reasons, Split-TCP has the potential to be widely deployed in both current and next generation networks.",

   "abstract": "We are witnessing how urban areas are reclaiming road space, before devoted exclusively to cars, for pedestrians. With the increase of pedestrian activity, we need to update our existing transportation forecasting models by focusing more on people walking. The first step of extending the current models is to start with collecting information on pedestrians needed for the trip generation phase. This article discusses opportunities and limitations of tracking pedestrian activity by utilizing information provided by cellular networks. In order to track people, regardless of the underlying wireless media, two qualifications must be met: first, unique and anonymous identification, and second, geospatial visibility through time. While the latter requirement can be achieved with techniques that are similar for different wireless media, how to uniquely identify a pedestrian using a cellular network is domain-specific. We show that tracking of pedestrians using cellular networks can be done not only without their constant active participation, but also without disrupting normal cellular service. However, although this method is technically feasible, one should be very careful when wanting to implement it by keeping in mind a very important thing: how to protect people's privacy.",

   "abstract": "OCC is a pragmatic version of VLC based on a smart device camera that allows easier implementation of various services in smart devices. This article presents a flexible and novel motion detection scheme over a smart device camera in OCC. The motion detection is conducted in conjunction with a static downlink optical camera communication, where a mobile phone front camera is employed as the receiver and an 8 x 8 dot matrix LED as the transmitter. In addition to the 8 x 8 dot matrix LED for data transmission, 10 white LEDs are also employed for providing illumination, acquiring camera focus, and light metering. The motion detection or MoC is designed to detect the user's finger movement through the OCC link via the camera. A simple but efficient quadrant division based motion detection algorithm is proposed for reliable and accurate detection of motion. The experiment and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to detect motion with a success probability of up to 96 percent in the mobile phone camera based OCC. It is envisioned that the proposed motion detection can facilitate cost-effective and convenient smart home environments in the OCC, where the provision of illumination and short-range wireless communications has already been addressed.",

   "abstract": "Mobile video traffic accounts for more than half of the global mobile data traffic nowadays, and the ratio is expected to further increase in the near future. However, providing high quality of experience for video streaming in mobile networks is challenging due to the heterogeneous and varying wireless channel conditions. To meet the increasing demand of high-quality mobile video streaming services, researchers have proposed several cooperative video streaming models that enable mobile users to download video contents cooperatively. The key idea is to pool network edge resources so as to either alleviate the load on the video servers and the cellular network, or alleviate the impact of channel variations and improve resource utilization. In this article, we review four types of cooperative video streaming models that pool various network resources effectively in different application scenarios. Then we focus on the crowdsourced mobile streaming model, which aims to pool users' download capacities in order to alleviate the impact of channel variations and achieve efficient utilization of network resources. We introduce the corresponding optimization issue of efficient resource allocation and the economic issue of user cooperation. We also outline future challenges and open issues in cooperative video streaming models.",

   "abstract": "The fifth generation of mobile networks is planned to be commercially available in a few years. The scope of 5G goes beyond introducing new radio interfaces, and will include new services like low-latency industrial applications, as well as new deployment models such as cooperative cells and densification through small cells. An efficient realization of these new features greatly benefit from tight coordination among radio and transport network resources, something that is missing in current networks. In this article, we first present an overview of the benefits and technical requirements of resource coordination across radio and transport networks in the context of 5G. Then, we discuss how SDN principles can bring programmability to both the transport and radio domains, which in turn enables the design of a hierarchical, modular, and programmable control and orchestration plane across the domains. Finally, we introduce two use cases of SDN-based transport and RAN orchestration, and present an experimental implementation of them in a testbed in our lab, which confirms the feasibility and benefits of the proposed orchestration.",

Then we categorize and classify SDVN concepts and establish a taxonomy based on important characteristics, such as services, access technologies, network architectural components, opportunities, operational modes, and system components. Furthermore, we identify and outline the key requirements for SDVNs. Finally, we enumerate and outline future research challenges.",

   "abstract": "Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a large number of base station antennas, often called massive MIMO, have received much attention in academia and industry as a means to improve the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and processing complexity of next generation cellular systems. The mobile communication industry has initiated a feasibility study of massive MIMO systems to meet the increasing demand of future wireless systems. Field trials of the proof-of-concept systems have demonstrated the potential gain of the Full-Dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO), an official name for the MIMO enhancement in the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP). 3GPP initiated standardization activity for the seamless integration of this technology into current 4G LTE systems. In this article, we provide an overview of FD-MIMO systems, with emphasis on the discussion and debate conducted on the standardization process of Release 13. We present key features for FD-MIMO systems, a summary of the major issues for the standardization and practical system design, and performance evaluations for typical FD-MIMO scenarios.",

   "abstract": "In response to the growing demand in the public safety community for broadband communication systems, LTE is currently being adopted as the base technology for next generation public safety networks. In parallel, notable efforts are being made by the 3GPP to enhance the LTE standard in order to offer public safety oriented services. In the recent Release 13, the Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety (IOPS) concept was introduced. IOPS aims at maintaining a level of communication between public safety users, offering them local mission-critical services even when the backhaul connectivity to the core network is not fully functional. Isolated operation is usually needed in mission-critical situations, when the infrastructure is damaged or completely destroyed, and in out of coverage areas. In this article, we present a detailed technical overview of the IOPS specifications, and then identify several research prospects and development perspectives opened up by IOPS, being a relatively novel concept in the mobile networks field.",

   "abstract": "5G mobile systems are expected to meet different strict requirements beyond the traditional operator use cases. Effectively, to accommodate needs of new industry segments such as healthcare and manufacturing, 5G systems need to accommodate elasticity, flexibility, dynamicity, scalability, manageability, agility, and customization along with different levels of service delivery parameters according to the service requirements. This is currently possible only by running the networks on top of the same infrastructure, the technology called network function virtualization, through this sharing of the development and infrastructure costs between the different networks. In this article, we discuss the need for the deep customization of mobile networks at different granularity levels: per network, per application, per group of users, per individual users, and even per data of users. The article also assesses the potential of network slicing to provide the appropriate customization and highlights the technology challenges. Finally, a high-level architectural solution is proposed, addressing a massive multi-slice environment.",

   "abstract": "The Bluetooth 5 specification, which introduces new core features such as advertising extensions, additional physical layer transmission modes, and an enhanced frequency hopping scheme, was released in December 2016. As a first step to a complete technology evaluation for Bluetooth 5, this manuscript assesses the performance of the advertising extension feature, compared to the connection-oriented and advertising data transfer approaches available in previous Bluetooth releases. Service ratio, communication delays, and battery lifetime of a network of Bluetooth devices are evaluated by means of computer simulations, considering a home automation use case with a realistic deployment and varying traffic loads. The results show that advertising extension guarantees good performance in terms of all considered indicators, although it suffers from higher losses compared to connections for low traffic loads, and longer delays compared to legacy advertising. Such tradeoffs can be exploited for standardization of future Bluetooth specifications.",

   "abstract": "Mobile users seek ubiquitous broadband connectivity even during a flight above the clouds. As many passengers are expected to be connected to high-speed Internet, robust and high-capacity direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC) to connect the aircraft with the ground cellular network is particularly attractive. In this article, we assess the capacity limitations of DA2GC links provided to an aircraft by employing currently available 4G radio technologies. Further, we study different capacity enhancement techniques toward 5G such as an implementation of Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) or coordinated beamsteering to improve DA2GC capacity. We also compare DA2GC performance with connectivity offered by satellites. According to our results, a DA2GC network extended with techniques toward 5G can increase the capacity available per aircraft by nearly 100 Mb/s in comparison with the 4G DA2GC network, assuming 20 MHz bandwidth is exploited. Although the maximum capacity provided by the 5G DA2GC network and satellite communication is the same, satellite communication exhibits only 40 Mb/s for 10000 deployed satellites on average. To motivate future investigation in this field, this article also outlines open challenges and research directions toward more efficient DA2GC.",

The 3GPP has dedicated a significant effort during its Release 14 to enhance positioning support for its IoT technologies to further improve the 3GPPbased IoT eco-system. In this article, we identify the design challenges of positioning support in LTE-M and NB-IoT, and overview the 3GPP's work in enhancing the positioning support for LTE-M and NB-IoT. We focus on OTDOA, which is a downlink based positioning method. We provide an overview of the OTDOA architecture and protocols, summarize the designs of OTDOA positioning reference signals, and present simulation results to illustrate the positioning performance.",

   "abstract": "Coexistence with WiFi is the key issue for unlicensed band LTE. The main coexistence mechanism is listen-before-talk, whereby radio frequency energy is sensed over a short period and compared to a threshold. Given the default energy thresholds, the energy sensing range is much less than the cell range. Either technology can experience a collision due to transmissions being below energy detection threshold. Currently, WiFi is agnostic to unlicensed band LTE. To improve coexistence, a relay-based communications channel is proposed whereby LTE announces its presence. Legacy WiFi APs may be programmed to interpret and respond by firmware upgrade . Higher performance for both networks is demonstrated via more effective radio frequency channel selection and adaptive energy detection thresholding.",

OOR leverages the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to map overlay identifiers to underlay locators, and to dynamically tunnel overlay traffic through the underlay network. LISP overlay state exchange is complemented with NETCONF remote configuration and VXLANGPE encapsulation. OOR aims to offer a flexible, portable, and extensible overlay solution via a user-space implementation available for multiple platforms (Linux, Android, and OpenWrt). In this article, we describe the OOR software architecture and how it overcomes the challenges associated with a user-space LISP implementation.

   "abstract": "An incentive mechanism is important for mobile crowdsensing to recruit sufficient participants to complete large-scale sensing tasks with high quality. Previous incentive mechanisms have focused on quantifying participants' contribution to the quality of sensing and provide incentives directly to them. In this article, we introduce a novel approach, called the social incentive mechanism, which, surprisingly, incentivizes the social friends of the participants who perform the sensing tasks. The basic idea is to leverage the social ties among participants to promote global cooperation. Since the incentive that a participant receives largely relies on the behaviors of his/her social friends, participants have the motivation to impact their friends' behaviors through their social relationships in order to gain a higher payoff. This approach is applicable to many scenarios where the contributions to the quality of sensing among participants are interdependent, such as data aggregation. We have provided a case study which shows that the social incentive mechanism is more cost-effective than traditional incentive mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "Currently, our society is undergoing a radical change due to the increasing pervasive use of ICT within all of its processes. Such an evolution has been triggered by the advent of the Internet of Things vision, where smart sensing devices can be integrated in the daily objects surrounding any human being. The increasing demand of dealing with the big data generated, managed, and stored by the applications built on top of such novel sensory networks has called for innovative architectures, such as edge and fog computing, which have not yet been fully standardized. Considering the large scale and complexity of these architectures, testing a software artifact to be deployed in the nodes composing an edge-fog ecosystem could be extremely challenging. Pure simulated environments and real testbeds could be not representative enough of realistic scenarios or unacceptably expensive. We explore such issues and present a pseudo-dynamic testing approach, where a portion of the experimental scenario is simulated, while the edge and fog nodes under test are emulated or executed in a real environment.",

   "abstract": "An important concept in wireless systems has been QoE-aware video transmission. Such communications are considered not only connection- based communications but also content- aware communications, since the video quality is closely related to the content itself. It becomes necessary, therefore, for video communications to utilize a cross-layer design (also known as joint source and channel coding). To provide efficient methods of allocating network resources, the wireless network uses its cross-layer knowledge to perform UEP solutions. In this article, we summarize the latest video transmission technologies that are based on SVC over MIMO systems with cross-layer designs. To provide insight into video transmission in wireless networks, we investigate UEP solutions in the delivering of video over massive MIMO systems. Our results show that in terms of QoE, SVC layer prioritization, which was considered important in prior work, is not always beneficial in massive MIMO systems; consideration must be given to the content characteristics.",

Although hundreds of active Booters exist today, only a handful of those that promoted massive attacks faced mitigation and prosecution actions. In this tutorial article we focus our attention on Booters that are \"under the radar\" of security initiatives, by advertising high attack power and being very popular on the Internet. We discuss and provide grounds for critical thinking on what should be further done toward Booter mitigation.",

   "abstract": "Online video streaming is becoming a key consumer of future networks, generating high-throughput and highly dynamic traffic from large numbers of heterogeneous user devices. This places significant pressure on the underlying networks and can lead to deterioration in performance, efficiency, and fairness. To address this issue, future networks must incorporate contextual network designs that recognize application and user-level requirements. However, designs of new network traffic management components such as resource provisioning models are often tested within simulation environments, which lack subtleties in how network equipment behaves in practice. This article contributes the design and operational guidelines for an SDN rapid experimentation framework (REF), which enables rapid evaluation of contextual networking designs using real network infrastructures. Two use case studies of a QoE-aware resource allocation model and a network-aware dynamic ACL demonstrate the effectiveness of REF in facilitating the design and validation of SDN-assisted networking.",

In this article, we describe the main design concepts when integrating mmWave RANs into 5G systems, considering aspects such as spectrum, architecture, and backhauling/fronthauling. The corresponding RRM challenges, extended RRM functionalities for 5G mmWave RAN, and RRM splits are addressed. Finally, based on these discussions, a framework is proposed that allows joint backhaul and access operation for 5G mmWave RAN, which we envisage as one of the key innovative technologies in 5G. The proposed framework consists of a joint scheduling and resource allocation algorithm to improve resource utilization efficiency with low computational complexity and to fully exploit spatial multiplexing gain for fulfilling user demands.",

   "abstract": "Supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is one of the major goals in 5G communication systems. Previous studies focus on ensuring end-to-end delay requirement by reducing transmission delay and coding delay, and only consider reliability in data transmission. However, the reliability reflected by overall packet loss also includes other components such as queueing delay violation. Moreover, which tools are appropriate to design radio resource allocation under constraints on delay, reliability, and availability is not well understood. As a result, how to optimize resource allocation for URLLC is still unclear. In this article, we first discuss the delay and packet loss components in URLLC and the network availability for supporting the quality of service of users. Then we present tools for resource optimization in URLLC. Last, we summarize the major challenges related to resource management for URLLC, and perform a case study.",

   "abstract": "5G wireless networks are expected to support new services with stringent requirements on data rates, latency and reliability. One novel feature is the ability to serve a dense crowd of devices, calling for radically new ways of accessing the network. This is the case in machine-type communications, but also in urban environments and hotspots. In those use cases, the high number of devices and the relatively short channel coherence interval do not allow per-device allocation of orthogonal pilot sequences. This article addresses the need for random access by the devices to pilot sequences used for channel estimation, and shows that Massive MIMO is a main enabler to achieve fast access with high data rates, and delay-tolerant access with different data rate levels. Three pilot access protocols along with data transmission protocols are described, fulfilling different requirements of 5G services.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radio technology can facilitate communication in smart grid applications through dynamic spectrum access. However, traditional routing and MAC protocols adopted for cognitive radio networks may not be beneficial in CR-based smart grid environments due to large data sizes and variable link quality among different functional blocks of smart grids. The interference and fading in wireless links necessitate efficient routing for reliable low-latency data delivery of smart grid applications. This low-latency data delivery must be achieved while protecting the legitimate primary users. Besides efficient routing, MAC layer protocols should be enhanced to achieve successful data delivery with simultaneous spectrum sensing and duty cycling for energy-efficient operation. In this article, we evaluate the requirements and key design challenges for routing and MAC protocols in the CR-based smart grid. We also provide a review of research carried out to date for routing and MAC protocols for the CR-based smart grid.",

   "abstract": "The future smart grid is envisioned as a network of interconnected microgrids (MGs) -- small-scale local power networks composed of generators, storage capacities, and loads. MGs bring unprecedented modularity, efficiency, sustainability, and resilience to the power grid as a whole. Due to a high share of renewable generation, MGs require innovative concepts for control and optimization, giving rise to a novel class of smart energy applications, in which communications represent an integral part. In this article, we review power talk, a communication technique specifically developed for direct current MGs, which exploits the communication potential residing within the MG power equipment. Depending on the smart energy application, power talk can be used as either a primary communication enabler or an auxiliary communication system that provides resilient and secure operation. The key advantage of power talk is that it derives its availability, reliability, and security from the very MG elements, outmatching standard off-the shelf communication solutions.",

   "abstract": "The 5G networks are envisioned to use mmWave bands to provide gigabit-per-second throughput. To extend the coverage of extreme data rates provided by mmWave technologies, we consider two-hop relaying based on D2D communication in an integrated mmWave/sub-6 GHz 5G network. Compared to single-hop multi-cell networks, two-hop D2D relaying in this network will complicate the network management. Relay selection and beam selection should be considered together as relaying in mmWave bands would use directional beamforming transmissions. MmWave/ sub-6 GHz multi-connectivity has to be managed, and resources have to be allocated across frequencies with disparate propagation conditions. In this article, a hierarchical network control framework is considered to address the relay and beam selection, resource allocation, and interference coordination problems. The sub-6 GHz band is responsible for network control and for providing relatively reliable communications, while the mmWave band provides high-throughput enhancement. Opportunistic relay selection and mmWave analog beamforming are used to limit the signaling overhead. We evaluate mmWave/sub-6 GHz multi-connectivity with and without two-hop relaying in urban outdoor scenarios for different site deployment densities. MmWave/sub-6 GHz multi-connectivity with relaying shows considerable promise for reaching consistent user experience with high end-to-end throughput in a cost-effective network deployment.",

This challenge will not be met using traditional approaches like increasing spectral efficiency and bandwidth, as witnessed in previous technology generations. Cell densification will play a major role thanks to its ability to increase the spatial reuse of the available resources. However, this solution is accompanied by some additional management challenges.

While solutions for pointto- point nanocommunications have already been proposed, larger networks cannot function properly without routing. In this article we focus on nanocommunications via FRET, which was found to be a technique with a very high signal propagation speed, and discuss how to route signals through nanonetworks. We introduce five new routing mechanisms, based on biological properties of specific molecules. We experimentally validate one of these mechanisms. Finally, we analyze open issues showing the technical challenges for signal transmission and routing in FRET-based nanocommunications.",

   "abstract": "With the anticipated arrival of autonomous vehicles, supporting vehicle generated data traffic due to the dramatically increased use of in-vehicle mobile Internet access will become extremely challenging in 5G-based vehicular networks. This is mainly due to the high mobility of vehicles on the road and the high complexity of 5G HetNets. In order to support the increasing traffic and improve Het- Net management, an SDN enabled 5G VANET is proposed in this article, where neighboring vehicles are clustered adaptively according to real-time road conditions using SDN's global information gathering and network control capabilities. With proposed dual cluster head design and dynamic beamforming coverage, both trunk link communication quality and network robustness of vehicle clusters are significantly enhanced. Furthermore, an adaptive transmission scheme with selective modulation and power control is proposed to improve the capacity of the trunk link between the cluster head and base station. With cooperative communication between the mobile gateway candidates, the latency of traffic aggregation and distribution is also reduced. Computer simulation results show that the proposed design substantially improved 5G users' bit error rate and trunk link throughput rate.",

   "abstract": "The migration of service providers' wide area networks toward SDN is a challenging task. In this article, we consider the critical requirements of G\u00c9ANT, the 500 Gb/s pan-European provider interconnecting 38 national research and educational networks, for a total of 50 million users. A long-term evolution path toward the softwarization of G\u00c9ANT is discussed, consisting of four steps to be realized in future years, from providing SDN-based connectivity, to the so-called software defined infrastructure (SDI). As a first step, the softwarization of some basic services currently offered by G\u00c9ANT is considered: G\u00c9ANT IP, G\u00c9ANT plus, and G\u00c9ANT Open. This article reports the concrete experience in the SDN-based design and implementation of these services, which have been called L3-SDX and L2-SDX. Both use cases have been addressed with the use of the open source Open Network Operating System (ONOS\u00ae). The L3-SDX service has been developed on top of an existing ONOS application, called SDN-IP. SDN-IP allows interconnections between SDN and legacy networks through BGP. The L2-SDX service has been realized as a new ONOS application. Both services are currently deployed on the G\u00c9ANT Testbed Service, a continental facility offering geographical virtual testbeds to the research community. The article reports the experience gained from this experimental deployment and discusses the benefits for a service provider like G\u00c9ANT.",

   "abstract": "Fueled by the ever growing consumption of digital content and services, providers of packet- switched networks suffer more and more a conflict between network engineering constraints and end-user usage patterns. This conflict is due to the fact that deployed networks exhibit low efficiency in their average resource utilization rate, which stands opposed to, at times, unsatisfiable resource request peaks generated by users. Multipath transmissions are theoretically able to temper this offset, but have been an uphill road due to the complexity they require to dominate. This article proposes a network paradigm able to transparently provide end users with such capabilities, by virtually pooling network resources through Software-Defined Networking. It is shown how this discipline may be deployed in current network infrastructures, while complying with the main 5G architectures envisaged so far. It is advocated how such an effort may allow service providers to meet users' expectations and strengthen profits without the need for unbearable financial investments, at the same time seamlessly improving their networks' performance, reliability, resource utilization efficiency and energy consumption. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and the potential benefits of the proposed approach, we present a set of emulation results showing that the sweet spot between n-fold performance increases and robust resilience properties can be practically met.",

However, the existing SDN applications in the vehicular network mainly focus on the data communications between the vehicles and other network nodes or devices, while the vehicular controller area network is still limited to some particular applications, only providing users with basic services, but unable to meet the demands in a complex driving environment. Thus, this article proposes an SDN-based approach to develop the safety-oriented vehicular controller area network, which can guarantee traffic safety based on driver fatigue detection and emotional recognition, which are monitored through the driver's physiological and psychological state.",

   "abstract": "With regard to cyber security, pervasive traffic visibility is one of the most essential functionalities for complex network systems. A traditional network system has limited access to core and edge switches on the network; on the other hand, SDN technology can provide flexible and programmable network management operations. In this article, we consider the practical problem concerning how to achieve scalable traffic measurement using SDN functionalities. Less intrusive traffic monitoring can be achieved by using a packet sampling technique that probabilistically captures data packets at switches, and the sampled traffic is steered toward a traffic analyzer such as an IDS on SDN. We propose the use of a centrality measure in graph theory for deciding the traffic sampling points among the switches. In addition, we discuss how to decide the traffic sampling rates at the selected switches. The results of the simulation and SDN testbed experiments indicate that the proposed sampling point and rate decision methods enhance the intrusion detection performance of an IDS in terms of malicious traffic flows in large-scale networks.",

   "abstract": "Lately, with the prevalence of digital devices and social network applications, the explosive growth of multimedia big data poses many challenges for users to obtain them securely in various application scenarios. In this article, investigating secure multimedia big data application in trust-assisted sensor cloud (TASC), which is one kind of SC for smart city, the recent work about multimedia big data and SC is reviewed first. Further, the critical issues that affect the success of secure multimedia big data in TASC are identified. With that, motivated by addressing the identified critical issues, this article proposes two types of TASC: TASC-S (TASC with a single trust value threshold), and TASC-M (TASC with multiple trust value thresholds). Finally, with extensive simulation results about TASC-S and TASC-M as well as SC without trust assistance (SCWTA), the following insights into secure multimedia big data in TASC are achieved: the throughput of TASC-S and TASC-M can both be generally higher than that of SCWTA; the throughput of TASC-S can trend with tuned trust value threshold; and the throughput of TASC-M can fluctuate with the same trust value thresholds.",

However, public key schemes like ECC can easily be broken by the upcoming quantum computers. Due to recent advances in quantum computing, we should act now to prepare the IoT for the quantum world. In this article, we focus on the current state of the art and recent developments in the area of quantum-resistant cryptosystems for securing the IoT. We first demonstrate the impacts of quantum computers on the security of the cryptographic schemes used today, and then give an overview of the recommendations for cryptographic schemes that can be secure under the attacks of both classical and quantum computers. After that, we present the existing implementations of quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes on constrained devices suitable for the IoT. Finally, we give an introduction to ongoing projects for quantum-resistant schemes that will help develop future security solutions for the IoT.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things is increasingly becoming a ubiquitous computing service, requiring huge volumes of data storage and processing. Unfortunately, due to the unique characteristics of resource constraints, self-organization, and shortrange communication in IoT, it always resorts to the cloud for outsourced storage and computation, which has brought about a series of new challenging security and privacy threats. In this article, we introduce the architecture and unique security and privacy requirements for the next generation mobile technologies on cloud-based IoT, identify the inappropriateness of most existing work, and address the challenging issues of secure packet forwarding and efficient privacy preserving authentication by proposing new efficient privacy preserving data aggregation without public key homomorphic encryption. Finally, several interesting open problems are suggested with promising ideas to trigger more research efforts in this emerging area.",

A smart city can monitor the physical world in real time, and provide intelligent services to both local residents and travelers in terms of transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns arise, since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city facilities and influence people\u2019s lives. In this article, we investigate security and privacy in smart city applications. Specifically, we first introduce promising smart city applications and architecture. Then we discuss several security and privacy challenges in these applications. Some research efforts are subsequently presented to address these security and privacy challenges for intelligent healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Finally, we point out some open issues for future research.",

Nowadays, cloud-based solutions can support collaborative data science platforms and deliver all types of processing operations through the network service chain. In this article we deal with healthcare-related data management and exchange, and we propose security and privacy requirements together with a novel microservices approach. We investigate how cloud computing can be adopted within healthcare systems. The interoperability of existing technologies will improve the quality of life and the efficiency of healthcare systems by making them more personalized and centered on patients, together with reducing operational costs and medical errors. To have a socially acceptable health network service chain, the security and privacy issues need to be analyzed and addressed. We explore the the security and privacy requirements and implications, and also discuss existing methods, and in the end propose an architecture of a secure manager for cloud-based healthcare-related data management and exchange.",

Unlike traditional mobile crowdsensing, fog nodes are introduced specifically to meet the requirements for location- specific applications and location-aware data management in vehicular ad hoc networks. In this article, we examine the architecture, applications, and especially security, privacy, and fairness of fog-based vehicular crowdsensing. Specifically, we first introduce the overall infrastructure and some promising applications, including parking navigation, road surface monitoring, and traffic collision reconstruction. We then study the security, privacy, and fairness requirements in fog-based vehicular crowdsensing, and describe the possible solutions to achieve security assurance, privacy preservation, and incentive fairness.

   "abstract": "The proliferation of connected objects has revolutionized the traditional Internet, giving rise to the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT ecosystem is very large, and it includes smart interconnections among sensors and devices with applications in both the industrial world and customers' daily lives. As a unified standard for IoT is still under development, many challenges related to IoT must be discussed and addressed, especially those related to energy efficiency. This article tackles the challenge of energy efficiency in IoT from a novel perspective. It shows that instead of maximizing the QoS, which is generally energy costly, better energy efficiency can be achieved by targeting satisfactory QoS levels only. The approach aims to enhance energy efficiency while ensuring a desired QoS threshold. This is supported by a game theoretical solution concept referred to as the satisfaction equilibrium. Moreover, as IoT objects require self-configuring techniques to maintain the network scalability and flexibility, this article introduces fully distributed schemes in order to reach efficient satisfaction equilibria in both slow- and fast-fading channel contexts. The proposed schemes can also be adapted to achieve the maximum performance of IoT applications that desire the highest QoS levels. The performance of these algorithms is illustrated through a smart home use case scenario.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we investigate cost-effective 5G-enabled vehicular networks to support emerging vehicular applications, such as autonomous driving, in-car infotainment and location-based road services. To this end, self-sustaining caching stations (SCSs) are introduced to liberate on-road base stations from the constraints of power lines and wired backhauls. Specifically, the cache-enabled SCSs are powered by renewable energy and connected to core networks through wireless backhauls, which can realize \"drop-and-play\" deployment, green operation, and low-latency services. With SCSs integrated, a 5G-enabled heterogeneous vehicular networking architecture is further proposed, where SCSs are deployed along the roadside for traffic offloading while conventional MBSs provide ubiquitous coverage to vehicles. In addition, a hierarchical network management framework is designed to deal with high dynamics in vehicular traffic and renewable energy, where content caching, energy management and traffic steering are jointly investigated to optimize the service capability of SCSs with balanced power demand and supply in different time scales. Case studies are provided to illustrate SCS deployment and operation designs, and some open research issues are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "By recognizing patterns in occupants' daily activities, building systems are able to optimize and personalize services. Established technologies are available for data collection and pattern mining, but they all share the drawback that the methodology used for data collection tends to be ill suited for pattern recognition. For this research, we developed a bespoke WSN and combined it with a compact data format for frequent episode mining to overcome this obstacle. The proposed framework has been evaluated with both synthetic data from a smart home simulator and with real data from a self-organizing WSN in a student's home. We are able to demonstrate that the framework is capable of discovering sequential patterns in heterogeneous sensor data. With corresponding scenarios, patterns in daily activities can be deduced. The framework is self-contained, scalable, and energy-efficient, and is thus applicable in multiple building system settings.",

   "abstract": "Although there is consensus that software defined networking and network functions virtualization overhaul service provisioning and deployment, the community still lacks a definite answer on how carrier-grade operations praxis needs to evolve. This article presents what lies beyond the first evolutionary steps in network management, identifies the challenges in service verification, observability, and troubleshooting, and explains how to address them using our Service Provider DevOps (SP-DevOps) framework. We compendiously cover the entire process from design goals to tool realization and employ an elastic version of an industry-standard use case to show how on-the-fly verification, software-defined monitoring, and automated troubleshooting of services reduce the cost of fault management actions. We assess SP-DevOps with respect to key attributes of software-defined telecommunication infrastructures both qualitatively and quantitatively, and demonstrate that SP-DevOps paves the way toward carrier-grade operations and management in the network virtualization era.",

   "abstract": "Optimal placement and selection of service instances in a distributed heterogeneous cloud is a complex trade-off between application requirements and resource capabilities that requires detailed information on the service, infrastructure constraints, and the underlying IP network. In this article we first posit that from an analysis of a snapshot of today's centralized and regional data center infrastructure, there is a sufficient number of candidate sites for deploying many services while meeting latency and bandwidth constraints. We then provide quantitative arguments why both network and hardware performance needs to be taken into account when selecting candidate sites to deploy a given service. Finally, we propose a novel architectural solution for service-centric networking. The resulting system exploits the availability of fine-grained execution nodes across the Internet and uses knowledge of available computational and network resources for deploying, replicating and selecting instances to optimize quality of experience for a wide range of services.",

   "abstract": "The latest impressive technological advancements in the telecommunications domain have entailed the involvement of new network operators and over-the-top (OTT) providers that offer their services over the existing networks. This entry of new stakeholders has changed the Internet dynamics and triggered a long-standing conversation on whether different types of data in the network should be prioritized, also known as the network neutrality debate. On the one hand, OTT providers benefit from the current neutral Internet policy of not discriminating against any application or content in order to transfer their data for free, whereas network providers would like to seize the business opportunity and create revenues by supporting the prioritized delivery of data. In this article, we want to shed light on the emerging Internet ecosystem and the conflicting interests of its stakeholders. To that end, we first identify the different Internet players and describe their interrelationships. Furthermore, in an effort to offer a new perspective on the network neutrality debate, we propose two novel econometric models that employ recent financial data to capture the relationship between the OTT revenues and the financial gains and investments of the telecommunication operators. Our empirical results provide tangible answers to fundamental questions that had not been answered before, showcasing that OTT and telecommunication providers have aligned interests and their collaboration could be beneficial to both parties.",

The high operational costs and impossibility of replacing or recharging wireless device batteries in multiple scenarios, such as wireless medical sensors inside the human body, call for a new technology by which wireless devices can harvest energy from the environment via capturing ambient RF signals. SWIPT has emerged as a powerful means to address this issue. In this article, we survey the current architectures and enabling technologies for SWIPT and identify technical challenges to implement SWIPT. Following an overview of enabling technologies for SWIPT and SWIPT-assisted wireless systems, we showcase a novel SWIPT-supported power allocation mechanism for D2D communications to illustrate the importance of the application of SWIPT. As an ending note, we point out some future research directions to encourage and motivate more research efforts on SWIPT.",

The complementary nature of the IoT and the could in terms of storage, processing, accessibility, security, service sharing, and components makes the convergence suitable for many applications. The advancement of mobile technologies adds a degree of flexibility to this solution. The health industry is one of the venues that can benefit from IoT\u2013Cloud technology, because of the scarcity of specialized doctors and the physical movement restrictions of patients, among other factors. In this article, as a case study, we discuss the feasibility of and propose a solution for voice pathology monitoring of people using IoT\u2013cloud. More specifically, a voice pathology detection system is proposed inside the monitoring framework using a local binary pattern on a Mel-spectrum representation of the voice signal, and an extreme learning machine classifier to detect the pathology. The proposed monitoring framework can achieve high accuracy of detection, and it is easy to use.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes to integrate two entities, the Internet of Things and a cognitive dynamic system (CDS), and studies a smart home scenario as the application of interest. As a people-centric IoT, the smart home aims to enhance the intelligence level of the living environment and improve the quality of human life. Cognition, the distinct principles of which are perception-action cycle, memory, attention, intelligence, and language, can play a key role to pave the way for building truly smart homes. With cognition as its foundation, the engineering paradigm of CDS provides step-by-step guidelines for systematic development of smart homes. Hence, CDS can significantly contribute to the interactive IoT ecosystem.",

   "abstract": "While a number of studies reveal the performance and effectiveness of applying wireless systems to various smart city applications, surprisingly, a market environment, in which we rely on a daily or weekly basis for purchasing essential goods, is still understudied. A wireless system in a market, along with rapidly growing IoT technology, can enable interesting applications such as automated electronic price tag updates, shopping- cart-based advertisements and information display, and automated inventory/stock management. These applications can first benefit market staff by automating routine tasks or opening possibilities for additional profits. Not only that: for everyday customers, these applications provide more reliable services by eliminating many man-made errors and offer additional services that can be enabled by newly gained connectivities. In this work, we introduce application requirements and technical challenges for such smart market applications and pilot deployment experiences in an urban large-scale market. Our pilot deployment experiences of wireless systems in markets provide quantified knowledge on the impact of various in-market activities on the wireless link performance and led us to design MarketNet, a wireless networking architecture suitable for IoTbased smart market systems. We see this work as a first step in bringing the attention of many researchers to a new application area, where wireless systems have the potential to benefit the quality of life of many smart city residents.",

   "abstract": "Toward ITS, academia and industry aim to utilize all possible radio access technologies in order to support reliable services and applications in VANETs. Thus, the inclusion of already deployed Wi-Fi networks in VANET topology is a crucial step for the next generation vehicular networks. However, the VANET topology also requires preservation of the features already offered by DSRC and the core cellular network. As a result, the coexistence of multiple different access technologies results in high complexity in terms of the control and management of the network infrastructure. To this end, software defined networking provides a promising opportunity to simplify the management and control of clumsy network infrastructures by decoupling the data and control planes in order to provide elasticity for current networks. In this article, we propose an architectural model that exploits this opportunity in order to enhance VANET with Wi-Fi access capability. Moreover, we offer a novel software defined VANET architecture that consists of soft OpenFlow switches with Wi-Fi capabilities as both roadside units and vehicles. In particular, we first investigate existing test tools and environments for software defined wireless networks and also supply a novel testbed architecture in order to provide a feasible test environment for evaluating the proposed architecture. Additionally, we propose a Wireless Access Management (WAM) protocol that provides wireless host management and basic flow admission with respect to the available bandwidth to validate the capability of the offered architecture. The observation results of the deployed testbed prove the conformity of the offered 802.11 architecture to the VANET.",

This motivates us to propose a unified communication framework for smart energy management by exploring the integration of software-defined networking with machine-to-machine communication. In this article, first we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art contributions from the perspective of software defined networking and machineto- machine integration. Second, the overall design of the proposed software-defined machine-to-machine (SD-M2M) framework is presented, with an emphasis on its technical contributions to cost reduction, fine granularity resource allocation, and end-to-end quality of service guarantee. Then a case study is conducted for an electric vehicle energy management system to validate the proposed SD-M2M framework. Finally, we identify several open issues and present key research opportunities.",

   "abstract": "The fifth generation wireless networks are expected to offer high capacity and accommodate numerous over-the-top applications, relying on users' Internet connectivity, thus involving different stakeholders, that is, network service providers and over-the-top service providers. For the efficient management of over-the-top application flows, the implementation of service functions and their interconnection in service chains, namely network service chaining, should consider the over-the-top service providers' performance goals and user management strategies. However, in current wireless network deployments, the network service providers have full control of network service chaining. Considering that user satisfaction from the offered services is a common interest for both types of stakeholders, the over-the-top service providers need to participate in network service chaining, and apply QoS and user prioritization policies to network service chain resource management, which involves users connected at different network points, in a distributed manner. In this article, we describe 5G network management architectures and propose virtualization components that enable over-the-top service-provider- oriented network service. We also outline the arising issues for over-the-top service providers in network service chaining and introduce a distributed prioritization network service chain management scheme for over-the-top application flows, based on matching theory. The evaluation results indicate the performance gains in over-the-top service providers' service levels that stem from the proposed scheme, demonstrating the benefits of introducing prioritization in network service chain deployment.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a software defined spaceair- ground integrated network architecture for supporting diverse vehicular services in a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective manner. First, the motivations and challenges for integration of space-air-ground networks are reviewed. Second, a software defined network architecture with a layered structure is presented. To protect the legacy services in the satellite, aerial, and terrestrial segments, resources in each segment are sliced through network slicing to achieve service isolation. Then available resources are put into a common and dynamic space-air-ground resource pool, which is managed by hierarchical controllers to accommodate vehicular services. Finally, a case study is carried out, followed by discussion on some open research topics.",

MEF 55 defines an agile methodology that, with support of proper tool chaining, can deliver open APIs from an information model in an automated fashion. This methodology is an example of a spiral approach with feedback loops that enable quick rework cycles at each step of the process and help to maintain integrity between all artifacts that are produced. By using the MEF life cycle service orchestration (LSO) PRESTO reference point and MEF PRESTO network resource provisioning (NRP) API as a running example, we discuss the steps of the LSO engineering methodology and propose a tool chain that enables process automation.",

   "abstract": "A VNF is a software entity to be run in diverse execution environments with variable configuration options and capabilities (e.g., hardware acceleration) impacting performance. NFV resource multiplexed infrastructures can impose hard-topredict relationships between VNF performance metrics (e.g., latency, frame loss), the underlying allocated resources (e.g., units of vCPU), and the overall system workload. Characterized by many-fold platform configuration and environment variables, the evolving scenario of NFV calls for adequate testing methodologies embracing modern continuous development and integration practices and leveraging open source tools and mindset. To this end, we introduce Gym as our proposed testing framework and methodology for automated NFV performance benchmarking. We present our design principles and the outcomes from a practical validation on a vIMS scenario. A discussion of the lessons learned and the overall NFV performance testing landscape are further contributions of this article.",

It is one of the key standards-based technologies to enable industrial process monitoring and control, and unleash the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The 6TiSCH stack is also a valuable asset for educational purposes, as it integrates an Internet-enabled IPv6-based upper stack with stateof- the-art low-power wireless mesh communication technologies. Teaching with 6TiSCH empowers students with a valuable set of competencies, including topics related to computer networking (medium access control operation, IPv6 networking), embedded systems (process scheduling, concurrency), and wireless communications (multipath propagation, interference effects), as well as application requirements for the IIoT. This article discusses how the 6TiSCH stack can be incorporated into existing and new curricula to teach the next generation of electrical engineering and computer science professionals about designing and deploying such networks. It also gives a comprehensive overview of the 6TiSCH stack and the tools that exist to support a course based on it.",

   "abstract": "Telecommunication standards have become a reliable mechanism to strengthen collaboration between industry and research institutions to accelerate the evolution of communications systems. Standards are needed to enable cooperation while promoting competition. Within the framework of a standard, the companies involved in the standardization process contribute and agree on appropriate technical specifications to ensure diversity and compatibility, and facilitate worldwide commercial deployment and evolution. Those parts of the system that can create competitive advantages are intentionally left open in the specifications. Such specifications are extensive, complex, and minimalistic. This makes telecommunication standards education a difficult endeavor, but it is much demanded by industry and governments to spur economic growth. This article describes a methodology for teaching wireless communications standards. We define our methodology around six learning stages that assimilate the standardization process and identify key learning objectives for each. Enabled by software-defined radio technology, we describe a practical learning environment that facilitates developing many of the needed technical and soft skills without the inherent difficulty and cost associated with radio frequency components and regulation. Using only open source software and commercial of-the-shelf computers, this environment is portable and can easily be recreated at other educational institutions and adapted to their educational needs and constraints. We discuss our and our students' experiences when employing the proposed methodology to 4G LTE standard education at Barcelona Tech.",

   "abstract": "The next generation mobile networks (5G) is about to introduce many new functionalities that will enable a portfolio of new services and applications to the benefit of the end user. One such functionality is positioning, which is a sought-after service especially for mobile network operators as location-based services is a massive market opportunity. To reach the goal of having the infrastructure ready for positioning services by 2020, this article tries to raise the awareness of the main technology and standardization gaps. One such gap concerns accurate and precise time synchronization, as one of the best telecom-based positioning technologies requires the mobile base stations to be synchronized to nanoseconds relative to each other. On top of that, the evolution of LTE and 5G will introduce a broad portfolio of new technology trends and concepts that will have a significant impact on the overall mobile network architecture and therefore will affect the traditional positioning concepts as well. Hence, the focus of this article is further extended to new technology trends that are directly related to the positioning functionality and are planned for broad deployment in the near future, or widely recognized to be essential for 5G, such as massive MIMO (mMIMO), mmWave, and dense small cell deployment.",

   "abstract": "We propose the TelcoFog architecture as a novel, secure, highly distributed, and ultra-dense fog computing infrastructure, which can be allocated at the extreme edge of a wired/wireless network for a telecom operator to provide multiple unified, cost-effective, and new 5G services, such as NFV, MEC, and services for third parties (e.g., smart cities, vertical industries, and IoT). The distributed and programmable fog technologies that are proposed in TelcoFog are expected to strengthen the position of the mobile network and cloud markets. TelcoFog, by design, is capable of integrating an ecosystem for network operators willing to provide NFV, MEC, and IoT services. TelcoFog's key benefits are the dynamic deployment of new distributed low-latency services. The novel TelcoFog architecture consists of three main building blocks: a scalable TelcoFog node, which is seamlessly integrated in the telecom infrastructure; a TelcoFog controller, focused on service assurance and based on service data modeling using YANG, which is integrated in the management and orchestration architecture of the telecom operator; and TelcoFog services, which are able to run on top of the TelcoFog and telecom infrastructure. The TelcoFog architecture is validated through a proof of concept for IoT services.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing has emerged as an efficient sensing paradigm that combines the crowd intelligence and the sensing power of mobile devices, such as mobile phones and Internet of Things gadgets. This article addresses the contradicting incentives of privacy preservation by crowdsensing users, and accuracy maximization and collection of true data by service providers. We first define the individual contributions of crowdsensing users based on the accuracy in data analytics achieved by the service provider from buying their data. We then propose a truthful mechanism for achieving high service accuracy while protecting privacy based on user preferences. The users are incentivized to provide true data by being paid based on their individual contribution to the overall service accuracy. Moreover, we propose a coalition strategy that allows users to cooperate in providing their data under one identity, increasing their anonymity privacy protection, and sharing the resulting payoff. Finally, we outline important open research directions in mobile and people- centric crowdsensing.",

   "abstract": "Network slicing is a technique for flexible resource provisioning in future wireless networks. With the powerful SDN and NFV technologies available, network slices can be quickly deployed and centrally managed, leading to simplified management, better resource utilization, and cost efficiency by commoditization of resources. Departing from the one-type-fits-all design philosophy, future wireless networks will employ the network slicing methodology in order to accommodate applications with widely diverse requirements over the same physical network. On the other hand, deciding how to efficiently allocate, manage, and control the slice resources in real time is very challenging. This article focuses on the algorithmic challenges that emerge in efficient network slicing, necessitating novel techniques from the communities of operation research, networking, and computer science.",

Many of these technologies are restricted by being platform-specific, application-specific, or not being open source. In particular, despite people being an integral part of the IoT ecosystem, the need for people-oriented applications and features has not yet been prioritized. IES Cities aims to address this by being a new cloud-based, citizen-centric platform. It is an open source, adaptable, and easy-to-use solution that has been designed around the needs of citizens and has been extensively tested in real-world deployments in a number of European cities. IES Cities is a working system that allows and encourages the building and rapid deployment of people- oriented, cross-platform applications across a wide range of smart environments.",

   "abstract": "Low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) are at the core of many Internet of Things solutions. Significant standardization effort has been put in creating a protocol stack suited for LLNs. Among these standards, IEEE 802.15.4-2011 and RPL allow LLN devices to form a multi-hop mesh network. Today, RPL creates a routing topology without a priori knowledge about the topology created at the MAC layer. This negatively impacts the number of redundant paths, their quality, and the overall performance of the routing protocol. In this article, we highlight the need for an intermediate layer between the MAC and network layers to solve these problems. We describe the protocols to be used in future Internet of Things, emphasize their weaknesses when deployed together, and propose areas of improvement.",

This article argues that fog computing will become part of that convergence, and introduces an open and converged architecture based on MANO that offers uniform management of IoT services spanning the continuum from the cloud to the edge. More specifically, we created the first YANG models for fog nodes, for IoT services involving cloud, network, and/or fog, and expanded the concept of \"orchestrated assurance\" to provision carrier-grade service assurance in IoT. The article also discusses the application of our model in a flagship pilot in the city of Barcelona.",

   "abstract": "Lab courses are a great setting to teach. However, to result in a successful learning experience, they often require teachers to spend a significant amount of time. This article reports about how lab courses can be implemented for efficiently supporting learners while significantly reducing the workload of teachers. The presented iLab concept consists of a blended learning teaching methodology and the labsystem eLearning platform that was especially designed for supporting the teaching methodology. Applying the concept results in students and teachers not having to spend time on surrounding tasks that produce overhead, but instead being able to focus on learning and teaching. The iLab concept enables teaching more content in less time. It especially reduces the workload on teachers, making lab courses scale. The iLab concept shows very good learning results with more than 1500 students between 2004 and 2017. The iLab concept was originally developed for teaching students about computer networks and distributed systems. In the meantime, it was successfully used in other domains such as training future teachers.",

   "abstract": "With advanced ICT, the ever-rapid development of informatization has become an integral part of smart city services in healthcare, transportation, energy, education, business, community life, and so on. A huge amount of data, called big data, is generated from various sources, and effective analysis and utilization of big data has become a key factor in the success of smart city services. However, in order to achieve precise big data analytics and make real-time decisions, one of the challenging issues is how to efficiently deliver the huge amounts of collected data to the processing servers. In this article, we first propose a novel architecture to support smart city services based on SDN technology. Then we study the time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under the proposed architecture, and present an intelligent strategy to address the TBTS issue by utilizing the SDN controller to conduct dynamic flow control and multi-path transfer scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can efficiently support big data transfer in terms of low transfer delay and high bandwidth utilization.",

Further, we introduce three types of sensor-cloud (i.e., PSC, ASC, and SSC) for green city. Specifically, about PSC, participatory sensing is incorporated into sensor-cloud for sensing big data. In terms of ASC, an agent is incorporated into sensor-cloud for transmitting big data. For SSC, a social network is incorporated into sensor- cloud for sharing big data. Finally, the open research issues with respect to big data and sensor- cloud are discussed, respectively. We hope this article can serve as enlightening guidance for future research regarding big data in green city.",

   "abstract": "It is expected that the incessant use of SBSs by indoor mobile users to achieve high data rate and high energy efficiency for their smart mobile devices will drive ultra dense deployment of SCNs within MCNs, specifically in future smart cities. However, SCN densification has a hard effect on the deterioration of the energy efficiency and QoS throughput of mobile users equipped with smart mobile devices like smartphones, laptops, PDAs, and tablets. This degradation is due to the severe cross-tier interferences occurring in ultra dense co-channel deployments of SCNs within MCNs. The present article intends to study the energy efficiency of mobile users for better battery life management of their smart mobile devices through minimal energy consumption during their uplink transmissions. The proposed solution, based on a fully decentralized algorithm for sharing time access executed by SBSs and multi-homing capabilities of macrocellular users, improves the energy efficiency of mobile users for better battery life, and keeps their QoS throughput requirements. Therefore, it leads to the eco-friendly smart mobile devices required in future smart cities. The results validate our proposed solution and show the improvement achieved compared to the conventional access control mechanisms. Furthermore, our scheme requires no coordination among SBSs and macro base stations, which reduces the huge signaling overhead when using cooperative schemes.",

   "abstract": "Knowing the variety of services and applications to be supported in the upcoming 5G systems, the current \"one size fits all\" network architecture is no more efficient. Indeed, each 5G service may have different needs in terms of latency, bandwidth, and reliability, which cannot be sustained by the same physical network infrastructure. In this context, network virtualization represents a viable way to provide a network slice tailored to each service. Several 5G initiatives (from industry and academia) have been pushing for solutions to enable network slicing in mobile networks, mainly based on SDN, NFV, and cloud computing as key enablers. The proposed architectures focus principally on the process of instantiating and deploying network slices, while ignoring how they are enforced in the mobile network. While several techniques of slicing the network infrastructure exist, slicing the RAN is still challenging. In this article, we propose a new framework to enforce network slices, featuring radio resources abstraction. The proposed framework is complementary to the ongoing solutions of network slicing, and fully compliant with the 3GPP vision. Indeed, our contributions are twofold: a fully programmable network slicing architecture based on the 3GPP DCN and a flexible RAN (i.e., programmable RAN) to enforce network slicing; a two-level MAC scheduler to abstract and share the physical resources among slices. Finally, a proof of concept on RAN slicing has been developed on top of OAI to derive key performance results, focusing on the flexibility and dynamicity of the proposed architecture to share the RAN resources among slices.",

In such environments, high availability and scalability are two of the most prominent issues, and thus extensive work is ongoing. In this article, we first review the state of the art on high availability and scalability issues in SDN and investigate relevant open source activities. In particular, two well-known open source projects, OpenDaylight (ODL) and Open Network Operating System (ONOS), are analyzed in terms of high availability (i.e., network state database replication/synchronization and controller failover mechanisms) and scalability (i.e., network state database partition/ distribution and controller assignment mechanisms) issues. We also present experimental results on the flow rule installation/read throughput and the failover time upon a controller failure in ONOS and ODL, and identify open research challenges.",

   "abstract": "Just recently, the concept of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) over wireless has taken the entire 5G ecosystem by storm, spurring an unprecedented interest from academia, industry, and others. However, the success of an immersive VR experience hinges on solving a plethora of grand challenges cutting across multiple disciplines. This article underscores the importance of VR technology as a disruptive use case of 5G (and beyond) harnessing the latest development of storage/ memory, fog/edge computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and others. In particular, the main requirements of wireless interconnected VR are described followed by a selection of key enablers; then research avenues and their underlying grand challenges are presented. Furthermore, we examine three VR case studies and provide numerical results under various storage, computing, and network configurations. Finally, this article exposes the limitations of current networks and makes the case for more theory, and innovations to spearhead VR for the masses.",

   "abstract": "Smart grid has emerged as the next generation of power grids for improved control and efficiency of power production, delivery, and consumption. Unlike the traditional power grid, a smart grid involves significant data communication across the grid. However, in the current practice, different areas of the power domain use different data semantic models, which has caused significant interoperability issues among systems and become a major barrier toward smart grids. Interoperability issues can also arise in communication. There has been growing interest in adopting publish-subscribe communication for improved quality of communication in smart grids. However, adopting publish-subscribe communication requires resolving potential interoperability issues with the client-server communication in the traditional power grid. In this article, we explore interoperability issues in smart grids and discuss how they can be addressed from the data and communication perspectives.",

   "abstract": "The emerging software defined vehicular networking (SDVN) paradigm promises to dramatically simplify network management and enable innovation through network programmability. Despite noticeable advances of SDNs in wired networks, it is also becoming an indispensable component that potentially provides flexible and well managed next-generation wireless networks, gaining massive attention from both industry and academia. In spite of all the hype surrounding emerging SDVNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding, and security is still the key concern and an equally arresting challenge. On the contrary, the complete transformation of the network into an SDN structure is still questionable, and the security and dependability of SDNs have largely been neglected topics. Moreover, the logical centralization of network intelligence and the tremendously evolving landscape of digital threats and cyber attacks that predominantly target emerging SDVNs will have even more devastating effects than they are in simple networks. Besides, the deployment of the SDVNs' novel entities and several architectural components drive new security threats and vulnerabilities. Since the SDVNs architectural layers and their corresponding APIs are heavily dependent on each other, this article aims to present a systematic top-down approach to tackle the potential security vulnerabilities, attacks, and challenges pertaining to each layer. The article contributes by presenting the security implications of the emerging SDVNs to devise comprehensive thematic core layered taxonomies together with external communication APIs. Moreover, we also describe the potential requirements and key enablers toward secure SDVNs. Finally, a plethora of open security research issues are presented that may be deemed appropriate for young researchers and professionals around the globe to tackle in anticipation of secure SDVNs.",

   "abstract": "With the cost of telecommunication becoming as cheap as Internet data, the telephone network today is rife with telephone spam and scams. In recent years, the U.S. government has received record numbers of complaints on phone fraud and unwanted calls. Caller ID is at the heart of stopping telephone spam - a variety of apps and services, including law enforcement, rely on caller ID information to defend against unwanted calls. However, spammers are using spoofed caller IDs to defeat call blockers, to evade identification, and to further a variety of scams. To provide a solution to this problem, this article proposes a standardized authentication scheme for caller ID that enables the possibility of a security indicator for telecommunication. The goal of this proposal is to help prevent users from falling victim to telephone spam and scams, as well as provide a foundation for future and existing defenses to stop unwanted telephone communication based on caller ID information.",

   "abstract": "Analyzing IP flows is an essential part of traffic measurement for cyber security. Based on information from IP flows, it is possible to discover the majority of concurrent cyber threats in highspeed, large-scale networks. Some major prevailing challenges for IP flow analysis include, but are not limited to, analysis over a large volume of IP flows, scalability issues, and detecting cyber threats in real time. In this article, we discuss the transformation of present IP flow analysis into a stream-based approach to face current challenges in IP flow analysis. We examine the possible positive and negative impacts of the transformation and present examples of real-world applications, along with our recommendations. Our ongoing results show that stream-based IP flow analysis successfully meets the above-mentioned challenges and is suitable for achieving real-time network security analysis and situational awareness.",

   "abstract": "Meeting the diverse delay requirements of emerging wireless applications is one of the most critical goals for the design of ultra-dense networks. Although the delay of point-to-point communications has been well investigated using classical queueing theory, the delay of multipoint- to-multipoint communications, such as in ultra-dense networks, has not been explored in depth. The main technical difficulty lies in the interacting queues problem, in which the service rate is coupled with the statuses of other queues. In this article, we elaborate on the main challenges in the delay analysis in ultra-dense networks. Several promising approaches, such as introducing the dominant system and the simplified system, to bypass these difficulties are proposed and summarized to provide useful guidance.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, the progress in both hardware and software allows user-space applications to capture packets at 10 Gb/s line rate or more, with cheap COTS hardware. However, processing packets at such rates with software is still far from being trivial. In the literature, this challenge has been extensively studied for network intrusion detection systems, where per-packet operations are easy to parallelize with support of hardware acceleration. Conversely, the scalability of statistical traffic analyzers (STAs) is intrinsically complicated by the need to track per-flow state to collect statistics. This challenge has received less attention so far, and it is the focus of this work. We present and discuss design choices to enable a STA to collects hundreds of per-flow metrics at a multi-10-Gb/s line rate. We leverage a handful of hardware advancements proposed over the last years (e.g., RSS queues, NUMA architecture), and we provide insights on the trade-offs they imply when combined with state-of-the-art packet capture libraries and the multi-process paradigm. We outline the principles to design an optimized STA, and we implement them to engineer DPDKStat, a solution combining the Intel DPDK framework with the traffic analyzer Tstat. Using traces collected from real networks, we demonstrate that DPDKStat achieves 40 Gb/s of aggregated rate with a single COTS PC.",

Alternatively, blocking malware via patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation.",

The nature of the trust in an innovation evolves significantly among the phases of the adoption as distinctive categories of adopters place different priorities on the three main elements of trust, which are the credibility, the integrity, and the benevolence of the innovation provider. The article explains how standardization effectively contributes to generate trust in an innovation in different manners along the various phases of the adoption cycle. We show how different types of standards, i.e. anticipatory, enabling, and responsive, help shape the relevant elements of trust for each category of innovation adopters. In conclusion, we discuss future avenues for the standardization of trust in order to manage it more effectively for the successful adoption of technology innovation.",

   "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining a lot of popularity among an ever growing community of amateurs as well as service providers. Emerging technologies, such as LTE 4G/5G networks and mobile edge computing, will widen the use case scenarios of UAVs. In this article, we discuss the potential of UAVs, equipped with IoT devices, in delivering IoT services from great heights. A high-level view of a UAV-based integrative IoT platform for the delivery of IoT services from large height, along with the overall system orchestrator, is presented in this article. As an envisioned use case of the platform, the article demonstrates how UAVs can be used for crowd surveillance based on face recognition. To evaluate the use case, we study the offloading of video data processing to a MEC node compared to the local processing of video data onboard UAVs. For this, we developed a testbed consisting of a local processing node and one MEC node. To perform face recognition, the Local Binary Pattern Histogram method from the Open Source Computer Vision is used. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the MEC-based offloading approach in saving the scarce energy of UAVs, reducing the processing time of recognition, and promptly detecting suspicious persons.",

While legacy ITS technologies are deployed worldwide in smart cities, enabling the next generation of ITS relies on effective integration of connected and autonomous vehicles, the two technologies that are under wide field testing in many cities around the world. Even though these two emerging technologies are crucial in enabling fully automated transportation systems, there is still a significant need to automate other road and transportation components. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation, and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many ITS application domains.

   "abstract": "Internet of Things devices communicate using a variety of protocols, differing in many aspects, with the channel access method being one of the most important. Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and Listen Before Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments Listen Before Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.",

   "abstract": "Will the Internet of Things happen? Clearly, the hardware and software components comprising the Internet of Things are technologically feasible, but the sweeping adoption we envision might not take place. The success of technological innovations depends on the creation of a business model that both customers and providers perceive as beneficial. As the recently abandoned Google Glass project shows, privacy concerns can kill an otherwise technologically feasible product. On the other hand, the example of Twitter illustrates that very popular products might fail to make money. Both academic researchers and businesses are becoming increasingly aware that we need to reason about the economic and social implications of provided value and privacy in a rigorous, quantitative way. In this article we call these quantities value of information, which appears to both the service providers and the customers, and cost of privacy, which normally is only relevant to the customers. We describe the importance of assessing these values in the context of the Internet of Things, possible directions of their formalization, their relationships to other problems, and related areas as well as future directions of the field.",

   "abstract": "Vehicles have embedded software dedicated to diverse functionality ranging from driving assistance to entertainment. Vehicle manufacturers often need to perform updates on software installed on vehicles. Software updates can either be pushed by the manufacturer to install fixes, or be requested by vehicle owners to upgrade some functionality. We propose an architecture for distributing software updates on vehicles based on SDN and cloud computing. We show that using SDN, the emergent networking paradigm, which provides on-demand network programmability, adds substantial flexibility for deploying software updates on vehicles. We propose solutions for how vehicular networks can be modeled as connectivity graphs that can be used as input for the SDN architecture. After constructing graphs, we present an SDN-based solution where different frequency bands are assigned to different graph edges to improve the network performance.",

Standardization of Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based V2X has been actively conducted by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to provide solutions for V2X communications, and has benefited from the global deployment and fast commercialization of LTE systems. LTE-based V2X was widely used as LTE-V in the Chinese vehicular communications industry, and LTE-based V2X was redefined as LTE V2X in 3GPP standardization progress. In this article, the overview of requirements and use cases in V2X services in 3GPP is presented. The up-to-date standardization of LTE V2X in 3GPP is surveyed. The challenges and detailed design aspects in LTE V2X are also discussed. Meanwhile, the enhanced V2X (eV2X) services and possible 5G solutions are analyzed. Finally, the implementations of LTE V2X are presented with the latest progress in industrial alliances, research, development of prototypes, and field tests.",

This allows us to support more ubiquitous vehicles, achieve better communication efficiency, and address limitations in conventional vehicular networks in terms of latency, location awareness, and real-time response (typically required in smart traffic control, driving safety applications, entertainment services, and other applications). Such requirements are particularly important in adversarial environments (e.g., urban warfare and battlefields in the Internet of Battlefield Things involving military vehicles). However, there is no one widely accepted definition for vehicular fog computing and use cases.

   "abstract": "Current radio access networks (RANs) need to evolve to handle diverse service requirements coming from the growing number of connected devices and increasing data rates for the upcoming 5G era. Incremental improvements on traditional distributed RANs cannot satisfy these requirements, so the novel and disruptive concept of a cloud RAN (CRAN) has been proposed to decouple digital units (DUs) and radio units (RUs) of base stations (BSs), and centralize DUs into a central office, where virtualization and cloud computing technologies are leveraged to move DUs into the cloud. However, separating RUs and DUs requires low-latency and high-bandwidth connectivity links, called \"fronthaul,\" as opposed to traditional backhaul links. Hence, design of the 5G transport network, that is, the part of the network that carries mobile data traffic between BSs and the core network and data centers, is key to meet the new 5G mobile service requirements and effectively transport the fronthaul traffic. Today, consensus is yet to be achieved on how the fronthaul traffic will be transported between RUs and DUs, and how virtualization of network resources will occur from a radio network segment to the centralized baseband processing units. In this article, we present a new 5G architecture, called virtualized cloud radio access network (V-CRAN), moving toward a cell-less 5G network architecture. We leverage the concept of a virtualized BS (V-BS) that can be optimally formed by exploiting several enabling technologies such as software defined radio (SDR) and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception. A V-BS can be formed on a per-cell basis or per-user basis by allocating virtualized resources on demand. For the fronthaul solution, our approach exploits the passive optical network (PON), where a wavelength can be dynamically assigned and shared to form a virtualized passive optical network (VPON). Several use cases of the V-CRAN are presented to show how network architecture evolution can enhance system throughput, energy efficiency, and mobility management.",

Specifically, both advanced terminal technologies (e.g., smart clothing) and advanced cloud technologies (e.g., big data analytics and cognitive computing in clouds) are expected to provide people with more reliable and intelligent services. Therefore, in this article we propose a Wearable 2.0 healthcare system to improve QoE and QoS of the next generation healthcare system.

These advancements cover many aspects, such as interface definitions, protocol mechanisms and security. Many scenarios discussed show that interfaces and standards can serve as a foundation for interoperable real-time multimedia applications that are easy to implement. In addition to the transfer of real-time-media data, the currently discussed protocol stacks also support transfer of non-media data. This article gives a brief top-down discussion of how the standardization efforts reflect the use cases of non-media data transfer, which use cases could be addressed, and how technologies are applied to achieve the goals. Furthermore, it provides an insight into specific protocol mechanisms as well as unresolved issues for future work.",

   "abstract": "WebRTC comprises a set of novel technologies and standards that provide Real-Time Communication on Web browsers. WebRTC makes simple the embedding of voice and video communications in all types of applications. However, releasing those applications to production is still very challenging due to the complexity of their testing. Validating a WebRTC service requires assessing many functional (e.g. signaling logic, media connectivity, etc.) and non-functional (e.g. quality of experience, interoperability, scalability, etc.) properties on large, complex, distributed and heterogeneous systems that spawn across client devices, networks and cloud infrastructures. In this article, we present a novel methodology and an associated tool for doing it at scale and in an automated way. Our strategy is based on a blackbox end-to-end approach through which we use an automated containerized cloud environment for instrumenting Web browser clients, which benchmark the SUT (system under test), and fake clients, that load it. Through these benchmarks, we obtain, in a reliable and statistically significant way, both network-dependent QoS (Quality of Service) metrics and media-dependent QoE (Quality of Experience) indicators. These are fed, at a second stage, to a number of testing assertions that validate the appropriateness of the functional and non-functional properties of the SUT under controlled and configurable load and fail conditions. To finish, we illustrate our experiences using such tool and methodology in the context of the Kurento open source software project and conclude that they are suitable for validating large and complex WebRTC systems at scale.",

   "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of traffic-intensive video applications, UDNs are treated as one of the most promising technologies for massive video delivery. However, due to the drastic interference between neighboring cells, how to achieve high energy and spectrum efficiency is still an open and challenging problem. This work proposes a systematic solution for content delivery over UDNs by integrating collaboration with intelligence. In particular, we first design a hybrid video coding scheme that is flexible and robust to the dynamic wireless environment. Then an active and proactive video update strategy is designed by intelligently alleviating the impact of the interference. Finally, a collaborative video scheduling scheme is developed to maximize the video quality as well as the energy and spectrum efficiency. Importantly, we summarize three fundamental design guidelines, and believe that they are useful for improving the transmission capacity of UDNs.",

   "abstract": "Electrical load forecasting is still a challenging open problem due to the complex and variable influences (e.g., weather and time). Although, with the recent development of IoT and smart meter technology, people have obtained the ability to record relevant information on a large scale, traditional methods struggle in analyzing such complicated relationships for their limited abilities in handling nonlinear data. In the article, we introduce an IoTbased deep learning system to automatically extract features from the captured data, and ultimately, give an accurate estimation of future load value. One significant advantage of our method is the specially designed two-step forecasting scheme, which significantly improves the forecasting precision. Also, the proposed method is able to quantitatively analyze the influences of some major factors, which is of great guiding significance to select attribute combination and deploy onboard sensors for smart grids with vast areas, variable climates, and social conventions. Simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms some existing approaches, and can be well applied in various situations.",

Smartphones, as the typical pivot of IoT devices, use various kinds of apps, which collect our private data. In fact, private data leakage, as a potential hazard, is caused by the current design trend in industry, which is bigger and bigger. However, few people notice the side-effect, while we seem never bored by pursuing \u201csmart\u201d devices. In this article, we introduce the behaviors of data collection, and illustrate the motivations and reasons behind them. Thankfully, cloud computing with sufficient resources and exquisite services is a perfect way out. We introduce a mobile-cloud framework to provide fine-grained permission authorization service for IoT devices, and show its performance by experimental results. Nevertheless, there are still lots of issues to be solved for the perfect IoT-cloud architecture. We list and analyze some obstacles and trends in the field of IoT-cloud.",

   "abstract": "Wi-Fi, which enables convenient wireless access to Internet services, has become integral to our modern lives. With widely-deployed Wi-Fi infrastructure, modern people can enjoy a variety of online services such as web browsing, online shopping, social interaction, and e-commerce almost at any time and any place. Traditionally, the most significant functionality of Wi-Fi is to enable high-throughput data communication between terminal devices and the Internet. However, beyond that, we observe that a novel type of system based on commodity Wi-Fi is increasingly attracting intense academic interest. Without hardware modification and redeployment, researchers are exploiting channel state information output by commodity Wi-Fi and transforming existing Wi-Fi systems into radar-like ones that can recognize human behavior along with data communication. This fancy functionality is tremendously expanding the boundaries of Wi-Fi to a new realm and triggering revolutionary applications in the context of the Internet of Things. In this article, we provide a guide to and introduce the impressive landscape of this new realm.",

   "abstract": "Although WiFi was initially designed for providing local access to the Internet, today's expansive and explosive deployment of WiFi networks has enabled nearly ubiquitous access for mobile users in many urban areas. However, these WiFi networks have been woefully undermeasured and underinstrumented during the wild expansion. We have closely collaborated with a leading network service provider to collect massive information about wireless APs and their users in four metropolises. In this article, based on the large-scale dataset, we attempt to answer the critical questions on how the APs are deployed and how they are utilized in urban areas. At the macro level, we depict the coverage of WiFi networks and the usage patterns, and by carefully classifying the APs, we unveil rich geographical features of today's urban WiFi networks. At the micro level, we identify the implicit social relationships among WiFi users, and uncover the underlying social communities that have great potential for network optimization.",

   "abstract": "The paradigm shift toward the Internet of Things results in an increasing number of wireless applications being deployed. Since many of these applications contend for the same physical medium (i.e., the unlicensed ISM bands), there is a clear need for beyond-state-of-the-art solutions that coordinate medium access across heterogeneous wireless networks. Such solutions demand fine-grained control of each device and technology, which currently requires a substantial amount of effort given that the control APIs are different on each hardware platform, technology, and operating system. In this article an open architecture is proposed that overcomes this hurdle by providing unified programming interfaces (UPIs) for monitoring and controlling heterogeneous devices and wireless networks. The UPIs enable creation and testing of advanced coordination solutions while minimizing the complexity and implementation overhead. The availability of such interfaces is also crucial for the realization of emerging software-defined networking approaches for heterogeneous wireless networks. To illustrate the use of UPIs, a showcase is presented that simultaneously changes the MAC behavior of multiple wireless technologies in order to mitigate cross-technology interference taking advantage of the enhanced monitoring and control functionality. An open source implementation of the UPIs is available for wireless researchers and developers. It currently supports multiple widely used technologies (IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE), operating systems (Linux, Windows, Contiki), and radio platforms (Atheros, Broadcom, CC2520, Xylink Zynq, ), as well as advanced reconfigurable radio systems (IRIS, GNURadio, WMP, TAISC).",

   "abstract": "The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services is accelerating, aided by ubiquitous wireless connectivity, declining communication costs, and the emergence of cloud platforms. Most major mobile network operators view machine-to-machine (M2M) communication networks for supporting IoT as a significant source of new revenue. In this article, we discuss the need for wide-area M2M wireless networks, especially for short data packet communication to support a very large number of IoT devices. We first present a brief overview of current and emerging technologies for supporting wide area M2M, and then using communication theory principles, discuss the fundamental challenges and potential solutions for these networks, highlighting tradeoffs and strategies for random and scheduled access. We conclude with recommendations for how future 5G networks should be designed for efficient wide-area M2M communications.",

This gives immediate access to various data about the objects and the environmental context -- leading to smart services and increased efficiency. A number of retail stores have started to adopt IoT enabled services to attract customers. In particular, thanks to indoor proximity technologies, it is possible to introduce location-based smart services to customers, for example, transmitting identifiable signals that represent the locations of stores. In this article, we investigate a potential security risk involved in such technologies: physical signals used as identifiers can be captured and forged easily with today's widely available IoT software for implementing location spoofing attacks.

   "abstract": "Multi-vendor interoperability can be achieved at node and network levels by relying on standard data modeling. YANG represents an attractive data modeling solution for network component definition. This article reports on the work done on YANG models for optical networks with particular reference to flexible-grid networks. In addition to a YANG model description for link, node, and media channels, YANG for a sliceable transponder is introduced given the importance of such a data plane device for the next generation backbone. Then a contribution is provided in proposing YANG models for events and state machine to further extend and increase the programmability of networks. This latter contribution is particularly relevant in the case of faults or physical layer degradation in a network. Finally, YANG models are validated in an experimental control plane testbed.",
