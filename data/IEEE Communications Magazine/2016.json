   "abstract": "Since 2012, 3GPP Release 12 (the beyond fourth generation (B4G) network) has been adopted as the next generation public safety network to be deployed in 2015. In addition to conventional high data rate transmissions in LTE-A, a public safety network is required to further support communications for users out of base station (BS) coverage. Avoiding any signal relay via BSs, direct data exchanges among users, known as device-to-device (D2D) communications, have consequently emerged as the most crucial innovation and the mandatory technology for a public safety network. However, due to the tight schedule for standardization, a special form of \"broadcasting\" communications has been adopted by D2D communications in Release 12. To fully comprehend such an unprecedented technology in cellular networks, this article provides a comprehensive overview of D2D operations in Release 12. From the system architecture to the radio interface, the provided insights boost the knowledge to practice D2D communications over cellular networks.",

   "abstract": "While there is clarity on the wide range of applications that are to be supported by 5G cellular communications, and standardization of 5G has now started in 3GPP, there is no conclusion yet on the detailed design of the overall 5G RAN. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the 5G RAN design guidelines, key design considerations, and functional innovations as identified and developed by key players in the field.1 It depicts the air interface landscape that is envisioned for 5G, and elaborates on how this will likely be harmonized and integrated into an overall 5G RAN, in the form of concrete control and user plane design considerations and architectural enablers for network slicing, supporting independent business-driven logical networks on a common infrastructure. The article also explains key functional design considerations for the 5G RAN, highlighting the difference to legacy systems such as LTE-A and the implications of the overall RAN design.",

   "abstract": "Mobile transport networks will play a vital role in future 5G and beyond networks. In particular, access transport networks connecting radio access with core networks are of critical importance. They will be required to support massive connectivity, super high data rates, and real-time services in a ubiquitous environment. To attain these targets, transport networks should be constructed on the basis of a variety of technologies and methods, depending on application scenarios, geographic areas, and deployment models. In this article, we present several technologies, including analog radio-over-fiber transmission, intermediate-frequency- over-fiber technology, radio-on-radio transmission, and the convergence of fiber and millimeter-wave systems, that can facilitate building such effective transport networks in many use cases. For each technology, we present the system concept, possible application cases, and demonstration results. We also discuss potential standardization and development directions so the proposed technologies can be widely used.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things paradigm is supporting - and will support - an ever increasing number of services and applications impacting on almost every aspect of our everyday life. The current trend is forecasting IoT to connect tens of billions of objects by 2020 yielding a very high volume of data to be acquired, transmitted, and processed. IoT typically relies on cloud computing to process, analyze, and store the data acquired by IoT entities. Unfortunately, the need to transmit all data from the information producing objects to the cloud for a subsequent processing/analysis phase would require a large bandwidth and increase the latency in the decision making process whenever decisions/reactions must be promptly made by the IoT units. The fog computing paradigm aims to address these problems by extending cloud computing toward the edge of the network. In this direction, this article introduces a novel FC-IoT paradigm designed to move computing, storage, and applications/services close to IoT objects so as to reduce communication bandwidth and energy consumption as well as decision making latency. The proposed IoT-based solution has been designed to have intelligent and autonomous IoT objects that are integrated with an FC and fog networking approach. The distinguishing features of the intelligent FC-IoT platform are low latency, self-adaptation, low energy consumption, and spectrum efficiency.",

However, the authentication for a large number of M2M nodes in smart grids has become a challenging issue. In this article, we design a lastmile authentication scheme for AMI that utilizes smart meters to enable two-way communications between the meters and the utility. We also present a framework of M2M authentication in smart grids via a two-layer approach, that is, global and local layers. More specifically, smart meters are authenticated globally by PKI, and authenticated locally by channel signatures. The usage patterns of electricity and personal private information are distributed separately in utility and service provider for protecting the privacy of customers. The proposed framework helps to achieve the goals of reliable and secure M2M communications among smart meters.",

At the same time, the demand for the \u201cbread and butter\u201d services of mobile broadband will continue to increase, driving the need for ubiquitous data capacity everywhere. Compared to 3GPP LTE, fifth generation radio access networks need to support much more diverse requirements with a wide range of deployment options for infrastructure and spectrum availability. Based on this insight, this article discusses a flexible and scalable radio access network architecture design.",

   "abstract": "A key objective of the IDEALIST project included the design and implementation of a GMPLS and PCE-based control plane for multi-vendor and multi-domain flexi-grid EON, leveraging the project advances in optical switching and transmission technology, an enabling interoperable deployment. A control plane, relying on a set of entities, interfaces, and protocols, provides the automation of the provisioning, recovery, and monitoring of end-to-end optical connections. This article provides an overview of the implemented architecture. We present the macroscopic system along with the core functional blocks, control procedures, message flows, and protocol extensions. The implemented end-toend architecture adopted active stateful hierarchical PCE, under the control and orchestration of an adaptive network manager, interacting with a parent PCE, which first coordinates the selection of domains and the end-to-end provisioning using an abstracted view of the topology, and second, delegates the actual computation and intra-domain provisioning to the corresponding children PCEs. End-to-end connectivity is obtained by either a single LSP, or by the concatenation of multiple LSP segments, which are set up independently by the underlying GMPLS control plane at each domain. The architecture and protocol extensions have been implemented by several partners, assessing interoperability in a multi-partner testbed and adoption by the relevant Internet SDO (standards development organization).",

   "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks, which deploy small cells in the mmWave band underlying the macrocell network, have attracted intense interest from both academia and industry. Different from the communication systems using lower carrier frequencies, mmWave communications have unique features, such as high propagation loss, directional communications, and sensitivity to blockage. Aiming to overcome the challenging problems in mmWave networks, such as interference management, spatial reuse, anti-blockage, QoS guarantee, and load balancing, we architecturally borrow the ideas of heterogeneous cloud radio access networks and software-defined networking to propose a software-defined mmWave mobile broadband system via a cross-layer design approach. In this architecture, a centralized controller is introduced by abstracting the control functions from the network layer to the physical layer. Through quantitative simulations in a realistic indoor scenario, we demonstrate the performance advantages of our system in terms of network throughput and flow throughput. This work is the first cross-layer and software-defined design for mmWave communications, which opens up an opportunity for mmWave communications to make a significant impact on future 5G networks.",

   "abstract": "A 5G frame structure designed for efficient support of users with highly diverse service requirements is proposed. It includes support for mobile broadband data, mission-critical communication, and massive machine communication. The solution encompasses flexible multiplexing of users on a shared channel with dynamic adjustment of the transmission time interval in coherence with the service requirements per link. This allows optimizing the fundamental tradeoffs between spectral efficiency, latency, and reliability for each link and service flow. The frame structure is based on in-resource physical layer control signaling that follows the corresponding data transmission for each individual user. Comparison against the corresponding LTE design choices shows attractive benefits.",

   "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were initially developed for military monitoring and surveillance tasks but found several interesting applications in the civilian domain. A promising application/technology is to use drone small cells (DSCs) to expand wireless communication coverage on demand. Rapid deployment along with limited operating costs are key factors that boost the development of DSCs for both military and civilian utilizations. DSCs are rapidly deployable to provide connectivity for temporary users (e.g. attendees of festivals, sporting events, or seminars), or over disaster areas to replace damaged communication infrastructure. UAVs are battery-powered, which makes energy consumption optimization a critical issue for acceptable performance, high availability, and an economically viable DCS deployment. In this article we focus on the scheduling of beaconing periods as an efficient means of energy consumption optimization. The conducted study provides a sub-modular game perspective of the problem and investigates its structural properties. We also provide a learning algorithm that ensures convergence of the considered UAV network with its unique Nash equilibrium operating point. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical investigations to assist our claims about the energy efficiency of the strategic beaconing policy (at Nash equilibrium).",

   "abstract": "Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications is the only reliable method for long-distance communications underwater, and is widely used in commercial, scientific, and military scenarios. However, the UWA channel is most challenging due to its double dispersion property in both long time delay and large Doppler spread, resulting in severe multipath spread and time variation. Among these, Doppler spread is one of the most critical challenges, and researchers have proposed various models in order to resolve Doppler spread in UWA channels. In this article, an overview of Doppler modeling and resolving is provided, divided into four stages: the quasi- static model of the mid-1980s, the uniform Doppler shift model in the 1990s, the basis expansion model and uniform path speed models of the late 1990s, and the recently developed non-uniform path speed model. Furthermore, the UWA channel sparsity property utilized by each of those models will also be discussed.",

   "abstract": "The computer communication research community has a significant interest in the paradigm of ICN. Continuously, new proposals for ICN-related challenges (caching, forwarding, etc.) are published. However, due to a lack of a readily available testbed, the majority of these proposals are evaluated by either theoretical analysis and/or conducting network simulations, potentially masking further challenges that are not observable in synthetic environments. Therefore, this article presents a framework for an ICN testbed using low-budget physical hardware with little deployment and maintenance effort for the individual researcher; specifically, named data networking is considered. The employed hardware and software are powerful enough for most research projects, but extremely resource-intensive tasks may push both components toward their limits. The testbed framework is based on well established open source software and provides the tools to readily investigate important ICN characteristics on physical hardware emulating arbitrary network topologies. The article discusses the testbed architecture and provides first results obtained from emulations that investigate the performance of various forwarding strategies. The results indicate that further challenges have to be overcome when heading towards a real-world deployment of ICN-based communication.",

   "abstract": "SDN is a centrally managed network architecture that automatically and dynamically allocates network resources to different types of workloads according to their application characteristics as well as current network conditions. We note that state-of-the-art SDN measurement mechanisms generally are slow, require reserved network resources, or use protocol-specific information when collecting flow-level statistics and constructing global network views. The lack of a fast and accurate SDN measurement mechanism significantly limits the effectiveness of SDN. In this article, we focus on the design of a scalable, accurate, and fast SDN measurement mechanism. We exploit packet-level statistics and propose a low-latency load-aware two-tier measurement and control platform for SDN. The port counter of the SDN switch, which tracks the number of bytes and packets that are sent and received on each port, is used for estimating link utilizations. The SDN switch actively monitors link states and pushes the statistics back to the SDN controller periodically for the detection of network congestion. When necessary, the controller can retrieve the flow statistics of the congested link from the SDN switches for traffic engineering. We implement a small-scale testbed and conduct emulations for evaluation. The experiment results show that compared to OpenSample and Planck, our two-tier mechanism quickly and accurately estimates link utilization and controls flow routes for better bisection throughput.",

   "abstract": "The separation between the control plane and the user plane is a key property of the newly proposed heterogeneous networks that will be widely deployed in 5G. In contrast to the failure of a small cell base station in the user plane which can be directly handled by the associated macrocell base station, the solution to handling a macrocell base station failure in the control plane is less investigated, in particular with regard to the signaling scalability issues of having all the affected small cell base stations directly communicate with the core network. In this article, we propose a small cell controller scheme for controlling and managing affected small cell base stations in a clustered fashion during the corresponding macrocell base station fail-over period. The advantage is to achieve substantial reduction of signaling overhead caused by user device handovers across small cell base station boundaries as compared to the existing solution, while maintaining comparable system performance. The proposed scheme is evaluated through realistic simulation studies and compared against the legacy scheme. The results clearly indicate that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the signaling latency and processing load on the core network during the macrocell base station fail-over period.",

   "abstract": "Prior work has shown that a biologically inspired approach can solve some of the fundamental transportation problems in urban areas. As one instance of this approach, it was shown that vehicles equipped with dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) radios can manage traffic in urban areas in a completely self-organized manner similar to self-organizing biological systems (e.g., ants, birds, and fish). This scheme is known as virtual traffic lights, and its success is enabled by the design of local rules which allow vehicles approaching an intersection to resolve the ensuing conflict in a seamless and self-organized manner without the need for any infrastructure. One important safety issue in urban traffic is how to manage the presence of emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks. In this article, it is shown that by designing a different set of local rules, one can give priority to emergency vehicles at every intersection, thus expediting their response times.",

   "abstract": "Recent years have seen the proliferation in versatile mobile devices and application services that demand different data rates and latencies. Fixed channelization configuration in today's wireless devices fail to be efficient in the presence of such dynamic demands. In this regard, fine-grained spectrum management designs have been advocated by the research community to embrace the heterogeneity in devices and services. However, manufacturers hesitate to make hardware investments without comprehensive understanding of these designs. To break this stalemate, software-defined wireless networking (SDWN) has been pushed to market as a cost-effective paradigm. Motivated by recent innovations in SDWN, this article systematically investigates the spectrum management architecture design that reaps the benefits of SDWN while maintaining the features of fine-grained channelization. We shed light on design principles and key challenges in realizing the SDWN-enabled spectrum management architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture with a new baseband virtualization design. We build a prototype that seamlessly integrates with the IEEE 802.11 protocol stack and commodity RF front-end. We demonstrate that the proposed architecture improves spectrum efficiency by emulating the upper layer behaviors using the traces captured in a campus WLAN.",

   "abstract": "Connectivity services are ubiquitous to enterprises, and many enterprises are looking to outsource basic networking services traditionally implemented using on-premise network equipment. The rising expectations on service providers to rapidly change the definition of services and the ability to introduce new types of network elements is leading to exploding complexity in the orchestration layer. The severity of this problem is such that the ability to introduce new services and new device vendors in the network is reduced due to the time and cost associated with such changes. We illustrate that a two-layered data model approach using the YANG language can help overcome these challenges. We use an example describing the process of implementing an IP MPLS VPN service in a network comprising sets of provider edge (PE) routers and customer edge (CE) routers. The example includes a service model and decomposition logic using data transformation, and we show the resulting configuration",

Due to the increasing availability of RAN features addressing mobile data delivery over a variety of spectrum access techniques, a new traffic steering design is required for the evolving LTE-Advanced Pro standard. LTE evolution toward 5G brings an opportunity to introduce a native and unified approach to the coordination of radio access mechanisms in multi-radio access technology networks for efficient data delivery in mobile networks. This leads to a design of a unified traffic steering framework, aiming at the orchestration of traffic steering related features for optimal radio resource utilization. Load-based radio access network coordination is presented and accompanied by illustrative examples to visualize how the multitude of LTE-Advanced Pro features can be handled in a holistic manner. Based on the proposed solution, potential evolution directions of mobile networks are discussed as an initial step toward the standardization of 5G.",

   "abstract": "Today, the rapid adoption of mobile social networking is changing how and where humans communicate. As a result, in recent years we have been increasingly moving from physical (e.g., face-to-face) to virtual interaction. However, there is also a new emerging category of social applications that take advantage of both worlds, that is, using virtual interaction to enhance physical interaction. This novel form of networking is enabled by D2D communication between/among the laptops, smartphones, and wearables of persons in proximity of each other. Unfortunately, it has remained limited by the fact that most people are simply not aware of the many potential virtual opportunities in their proximity at any given time. This is a result of the very real digital privacy and security concerns surrounding direct communication between \"stranger\" devices. Fortunately, these concerns can be mitigated with the help of a centralized trusted entity, such as a cellular service provider, which can not only authenticate and protect the privacy of devices involved into D2D communication, but also facilitate the discovery of device capabilities and their available content. This article offers an extensive research summary behind this type of \"cellular-assisted\" D2D communication, detailing the enabling technology and its implementation, relevant usage scenarios, security challenges, and user experience observations from large-scale deployments.",

   "abstract": "The emergence of the Internet of Things paradigm promises a multi-disciplinary revolution covering different spheres of our daily lives. However, the ubiquitous nature of IoT requires inclusive approaches in order to agree on a common understanding about its implications. Particularly, in order to unlock its huge potential and maximize its benefits, it is necessary to minimize the risks that are associated with security and privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a comprehensive architectural design to capture the main security and privacy requirements during the lifecycle of a smart object. The resulting architecture has been designed, instantiated, and implemented within the scope of different European IoT initiatives, in order to promote the design and development of secure and privacy-aware IoT-enabled services.",

   "abstract": "Communication networks these days face a relentless increase in traffic load. Multi-gigabitper- second links are becoming widespread, and network devices are under continuous stress, so testing whether they guarantee the specified throughput or delay is a must. Software-based solutions, such as packet-train traffic injection, were adequate for lower speeds, but they have become inaccurate in the current scenario. Hardware-based solutions have proved to be very accurate, but usually at the expense of much higher development and acquisition costs. Fortunately, new affordable FPGA SoC devices, as well as high-level synthesis tools, can very efficiently reduce these costs. In this article we show the advantages of hardware-based solutions in terms of accuracy, comparing the results obtained in an FPGA SoC development platform and in NetFPGA-10G to those of software. Results show that a hardware-based solution is significantly better, especially at 10 Gb/s. By leveraging high-level synthesis and open source platforms, prototypes were quickly developed. Noticeable advantages of our proposal are high accuracy, competitive cost with respect to the software counterpart, which runs in high-end off-the-shelf workstations, and the capability to easily evolve to upcoming 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s networks.",

   "abstract": "In light of recent natural catastrophes and terrorist activities, it has become evident that new architectural approaches are needed for next generation public protection and disaster relief networks. These architectures should be adaptable to the conditions at the event site and resilient enough to operate under adverse conditions in an emergency. Furthermore, they should enable rapid gathering of crucial event data and its delivery to the responder units at the site as well as the command and control center that is off-site. In this article, we first examine the state of the art in areas related to communication in PPDR systems, and discuss the open research issues for each topic. Then we propose a novel architecture that meets the aforementioned requirements and relies on a novel device called an ICG. An ICG enables flexible use of the spectrum and facilitates data gathering from all lower-tier devices and relays this data to relevant units through the higher-tier public or commercial backhaul networks. Finally, we provide some results that justify the need for these devices in emergency scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Modern cellular networks in traditional frequency bands are notoriously interference-limited, especially in urban areas, where base stations are deployed in close proximity to one another. The latest releases of LTE incorporate features for coordinating downlink transmissions as an efficient means of managing interference. Recent field trial results and theoretical studies of the performance of JT CoMP schemes revealed, however, that their gains are not as high as initially expected, despite the large coordination overhead. These schemes are known to be very sensitive to defects in synchronization or information exchange between coordinating base stations as well as uncoordinated interference. In this article, we review recent advanced CB schemes as alternatives, requiring less overhead than JT CoMP while achieving good performance in realistic conditions. By stipulating that in certain LTE scenarios of increasing interest, uncoordinated interference constitutes a major factor in the performance of CoMP techniques at large, we hereby assess the resilience of the state-of- the-art CB to uncoordinated interference. We also describe how these techniques can leverage the latest specifications of current cellular networks, and how they may perform when we consider standardized feedback and coordination. This allows us to identify some key road blocks and research directions to address as LTE evolves toward the future of mobile communications.",

The technology holds great potential in enhancing LTE with the necessary capability to accommodate the unprecedented traffic volume that today's wireless cellular system is facing. However, the high density of RRHs in C-RANs leads to severe scalability issues in terms of computational and implementation complexities. This article discusses the challenges and recent developments in the technologies that potentially address the scalability issues of C-RANs. In particular, we focus on the collaborative signal processing, resource management, and green architecture of C-RAN systems. This article is a humble attempt to draw the attention of the research community to the following important question: how to leverage the revolutionary architecture of C-RAN to attain unprecedented system capacity at an affordable cost and complexity.",

   "abstract": "Beyond traditional telecom providers, citizens and organizations pool their own resources and coordinate in order to build local network infrastructures to address the digital divide in many parts of the world. These crowdsourced network infrastructures can be self-organized and shared by a community for the collective benefit of its members. Several of these networks have developed open, free, and neutral agreements, and are governed as a common-pool resource: community networks. These are built using a variety of commodity wireless hardware (e.g., Wi-Fi long-range point-to-point links, Wi-Fi and GSM access points, and mesh networks), sometimes optical fiber links, heterogeneous nodes, routing protocols, and applications. A group of researchers, developers, and community networks developed the Community-Lab testbed, and for the last five years have worked together to overcome obstacles, improve the technologies, tools, and operational models being used, as well as model best practices for more effective and sustainable community networks. This article presents the challenges for experimentation, the testbeds built, results, lessons learned, and the impact of that work to place wireless community networks as one sustainable way toward an Internet accessible to all.",

   "abstract": "Advanced meter infrastructures (AMIs) are systems that measure, collect, and analyze utilities distribution and consumption, and communicate with metering devices either on a schedule or on request. AMIs are becoming a vital part of utilities distribution network and allow the development of Smart Cities. In this article we propose an integrated Internet of Things architecture for smart meter networks to be deployed in smart cities. We discuss the communication protocol, the data format, the data gathering procedure, and the decision system based on big data treatment. The architecture includes electricity, water, and gas smart meters. Real measurements show the benefits of the proposed IoT architecture for both the customers and the utilities.",

   "abstract": "In the last few years, SDN and NFV have introduced a new way to design, deploy, and manage networking and application services in telecommunications networks. In this context, this article presents an SDN/NFV-based platform for telco operators who intend to enter the market of video broadcasting service providers. The proposed platform allows telco operators to achieve deployment simplification and management cost reduction to support big/small live streaming content providers, and even unusual video broadcasters, in transmitting video flows to a number of interested users that can be either fixed or mobile, without the need to adopt a dedicated and expensive data delivery infrastructure. The design of the architecture proposed in this article is the result of a cooperative work realized by Telecom Italia, the University of Catania, and Wave Joint Open Lab (JOL), representing three of the most important roles in the evolution process of telecommunications networks toward network softwarization, that is, telco operator, academia, and research lab. Besides an operational and functional description of the proposed architecture, the article discusses implementation aspects of the platform, by introducing a proof of concept that has been realized on the JOLNet platform, a nationwide Italian SDN experimental network developed by Telecom Italia to interconnect its JOL labs with a large-scale geographical facility, with the aim of carrying on research and experimentations on SDN technologies and applications.",

   "abstract": "This article argues that SDN and NFV, together with cloud and edge-fog computing, can be seen as different facets of a systemic transformation of telecommunications and ICT, called softwarization. The first impact will be at the edge of current telecommunications infrastructures, which are becoming powerful network and service platforms. The edge operating system (EOS) software architecture is proposed as the means to get there. In fact, the main feature of EOS is to bring several service domains, such as cloud robotics, Internet of Things, and Tactile Internet, into convergence at the edge. The development of EOS leverages available open source software. A use case is described to validate the EOS with a proof-of-concept.",

New physical layer solutions, MAC procedures, and network architectures are needed to evolve the current LTE cellular systems to meet the demands of IoT services. Several steps have been taken under the 3GPP to accomplish these objectives and are included in the upcoming 3GPP LTE standards release (3GPP Release 13). In this tutorial article, we present an overview of several features included in 3GPP to accommodate the needs of M2M communications, including changes in the physical layer such as enhanced machine type communications, and new MAC and higher-layer procedures provided by extended discontinuous reception. We also briefly discuss the narrowband IoT, which is in the development stage with a target completion date of June 2016.",

   "abstract": "End-user applications are provisioned in cloud settings using PaaS. Portability is key to the success of end-user application providers because it helps avoid vendor lock-in. It makes the components deployment of the same end-user application across multiple PaaS possible. It also enables them to move end-user applications from PaaS to PaaS with minimal adaptation efforts. This survey discusses and evaluates the approaches proposed so far within the standardization bodies, research projects, and academia for enabling end-user applications portability in PaaS. It also identifies the trajectory of research on the topic. An illustrative use case is described in order to identify evaluation requirements, and then the state of the art is reviewed in light of the requirements. The identified research directions are related to application executables, deployment descriptors, and operations, and a comprehensive set of management operations in the PaaS.",

   "abstract": "The single most important factor enabling the data rate increases in wireless networks over the past few decades has been densification, namely adding more base stations and access points and thus getting more spatial reuse of the spectrum. This trend is set to continue into 5G and beyond. However, at some point further densification will no longer be able to provide exponentially increasing data rates. Like the end of Moore's Law, this will have extensive implications for the entire technology landscape, which depends ever more heavily on wireless connectivity. When and why will this happen? How might we delay this from occurring for as long as possible? These are the questions explored in this article.",

   "abstract": "In order to cope with the relentless data tsunami in 5G wireless networks, current approaches such as acquiring new spectrum, deploying more BSs, and increasing nodes in mobile packet core networks are becoming ineffective in terms of scalability, cost and flexibility. In this regard, context- aware 5G networks with edge/cloud computing and exploitation of big data analytics can yield significant gains for mobile operators. In this article, proactive content caching in 5G wireless networks is investigated in which a big-data-enabled architecture is proposed. In this practical architecture, a vast amount of data is harnessed for content popularity estimation, and strategic contents are cached at BSs to achieve higher user satisfaction and backhaul offloading. To validate the proposed solution, we consider a real-world case study where several hours worth of mobile data traffic is collected from a major telecom operator in Turkey, and big-data-enabled analysis is carried out, leveraging tools from machine learning. Based on the available information and storage capacity, numerical studies show that several gains are achieved in terms of both user satisfaction and backhaul offloading. For example, in the case of 16 BSs with 30 percent of content ratings and 13 GB storage size (78 percent of total library size), proactive caching yields 100 percent user satisfaction and offloads 98 percent of the backhaul.",

   "abstract": "The chirp signal is one of the first bio-inspired signals commonly used in RF applications where the term chirp is a reference to the chirping sound made by birds. It has since been recognized that birds communicate through such chirping sounds to attract other birds of the same species, to transmit an alarm for specific threats, and so on. However, birds of a different species, or sometime even birds in a different social group within a species, are unable to connect a specific meaning to certain calls - they will simply hear a bird chirping. Inspired by such, this article provides a tutorial on a novel RF steganography scheme to conceal digital communication in linear chirp radar signals. We first provide a review of the linear chirp signal and existing communication systems using chirp waveforms. Next we discuss how to implement the RF steganography and hide digitally modulated communication information inside a linear chirp radar signal to prevent an enemy from detecting the existence of such hidden information. A new modulation called reduced phase shift keying is employed to make the modulated chirp waveform almost identical to the unmodulated chirp signal. Furthermore, variable symbol durations are employed to eliminate cyclostationary features that might otherwise be exploited by an enemy to detect the existence of the hidden information.",

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a pivotal role in CPSs, particularly for operations such as surveillance and monitoring. However, these WSNs are subject to various types of cyberattacks that can cause damage, theft, or destruction of sensitive data, in addition to disruption of services provided by CPSs. To strengthen cybersecurity in WSN-enabled CPSs, various researchers have proposed a new category of efficient algorithms, inspired by biological phenomena. We present a careful review of different bio-inspired techniques developed for improving cybersecurity of CPSs using WSNs. Additionally, we propose a generic bio-inspired model called Swarm Intelligence for WSN Cybersecurity (SIWC) that addresses drawbacks of prior bio-inspired approaches.",

   "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy was designed as a low-power alternative to classic Bluetooth. However, the use of BLE in dense Internet of Things deployments results in high collision rates and wasted energy. To alleviate some of this contention, we present opportunistic listening, an extension to BLE active mode targeting IoT deployments with large numbers of tags and small numbers of scanning devices. For dense deployments of passive advertising devices, we present the design of Smart LaBLEs (BLE-enabled, electronic, de-centralized hubs), which aggregate multiple advertisements across similar products in a retail environment.",

   "abstract": "Buffer sizing is an important network configuration parameter that impacts the quality of service characteristics of data traffic. With falling memory costs and the fallacy that \"more is better,\" network devices are being overprovisioned with large buffers. This may increase queueing delays experienced by a packet and subsequently impact stability of core protocols such as TCP. The problem has been studied extensively for wired networks. However, there is little work addressing the unique challenges of wireless environments such as time-varying channel capacity, variable packet inter-service time, and packet aggregation, among others. In this article we discuss these challenges, classify the current state-of-the-art solutions, discuss their limitations, and provide directions for future research in the area.",

   "abstract": "C-RAN has become a promising scenario to accommodate high-performance services, which provides ubiquitous user coverage and supports real-time cloud computing using cloud BBUs. The interaction between RRH and BBU or resource schedule among BBUs in cloud have become more frequent and complex due to the development of system-scale and user requirements. The heavy-duty interaction can promote the networking demand among RRHs and BBUs, and forces to form elastic optical fiber switching and optical networking according to the characteristics of high bandwidth, low cost, and transparent multi-rate traffic transmission. In such a network, the multiple stratum resources of radio, optical, and BBU processing unit have interwoven with each other, so the traditional architecture cannot efficiently implement the resource optimization and scheduling for the high-level QoS guarantee. In this article, we present a novel C-RoFN architecture for MSRO using software defined networking. The proposed architecture can globally optimize radio frequency, optical spectrum, and BBU processing resources effectively to maximize radio coverage and meet the QoS requirement. The functional modules of C-RoFN architecture, including the core elements of radio, optical, and BBU controllers, are described in detail. The cooperation procedures in multi-layer vertical integration and cross-stratum horizontal merging models are investigated. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are also experimentally demonstrated on our SDN-enabled testbed with OpenFlow-enabled elastic optical nodes, and compared to cross-stratum optimization strategy in terms of resource occupation and path provisioning latency. Numerical results are given and analyzed based on the testbed. Some future discussions are presented in the conclusion.",

   "abstract": "Content delivery service has become a major traffic load on today's Internet, and this has triggered the interest of ISPs in operating their own content delivery networks (CDNs) to optimize Internet traffic considering both content delivery caching and user-network proximity. ISPs, however, are typically regionally bound or network-domain-wise isolated; hence, their CDN gain is somewhat limited. In order to enhance the gain of ISP CDN services to the level of incumbent global CDNs, a CDN interconnection (CDNI) model is introduced by IETF, where local ISP CDN services can be extended among heterogeneous CDNs across network domains. However, despite the multiple benefits of a CDNI system, it is difficult to apply a CDNI service to the current CDN market due to the platform independence. Hence, we introduced a CDNI gateway model that is standard-capable and platform-independent. With the CDNI gateway model, we design and implement a complete CDNI system and conduct a CDNI service trial with three major ISPs in South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CDNI service trial complying with the IETF standard achieved by a multi-ISP collaboration. According to the analysis of experimental results from the service trial, we observe that CDNI can reduce content traffic by about 40 percent at the Internet exchange link compared to a legacy CDN system.",

   "abstract": "CMOS ADC-based serial link receivers enable powerful digital equalization and symbol detection techniques for high data rate operation over electrical and optical wireline channels. Common ADC architectures and equalization techniques that allow 10 Gb/s and higher operation are surveyed in this article. As time-interleaving is most often employed to achieve these high sampling rates, the associated errors and calibration techniques are presented. The impact of ADC quantization noise on receiver performance and how this can be improved via embedded partial analog equalization are detailed. A description of a 65 nm CMOS hybrid ADC-based receiver architecture that employs a 3-tap analog FFE embedded inside a 6-bit asynchronous successive approximation register (SAR) ADC and a per-symbol dynamically enabled digital equalizer operating at 10 Gb/s concludes the discussion.",

These improvements are rooted in the fact that popular contents are reused, asynchronously, by many users. In this article we first introduce methods to predict the popularity distributions and user preferences, and the impact of erroneous information. We then discuss the two aspects of caching systems, content placement and delivery. We expound the key differences between wired and wireless caching, and outline the differences in the system arising from where the caching takes place (e.g., at base stations or on the wireless devices themselves). Special attention is paid to the essential limitations in wireless caching, and possible trade-offs between spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and cache size.",

   "abstract": "A traditional cellular system (e.g., LTE) operates only on licensed spectrum. This article describes the concept of cellular communications on both licensed and license-exempt/unlicensed spectrum under a unified architecture. The purpose of extending a cellular system into the bandwidth-rich license-exempt spectrum is to form a larger cellular network for both spectrum types. This would result in an ultimate mobile converged cellular network. This article examines the benefits of this concept and the technical challenges, and provides a conceptual LTE-based design example that demonstrates how a traditional cellular system like LTE can adapt itself to a different spectrum type, conform to the regulatory requirements, and harmoniously coexist with the incumbent systems such as WiFi. In order to cope with the interference and regulatory rules on license-exempt spectrum, a special medium access mechanism is introduced into the existing LTE transmission frame structure to exploit the full benefits of coordinated and managed cellular architecture.",

   "abstract": "Clock synchronization is highly desirable in distributed systems, including many applications in the Internet of Things and Humans. It improves the efficiency, modularity, and scalability of the system, and optimizes use of event triggers. For IoTH, BLE - a subset of the recent Bluetooth v4.0 stack - provides a low-power and loosely coupled mechanism for sensor data collection with ubiquitous units (e.g., smartphones and tablets) carried by humans. This fundamental design paradigm of BLE is enabled by a range of broadcast advertising modes. While its operational benefits are numerous, the lack of a common time reference in the broadcast mode of BLE has been a fundamental limitation. This article presents and describes CheepSync, a time synchronization service for BLE advertisers, especially tailored for applications requiring high time precision on resource constrained BLE platforms. Designed on top of the existing Bluetooth v4.0 standard, the CheepSync framework utilizes low-level timestamping and comprehensive error compensation mechanisms for overcoming uncertainties in message transmission, clock drift, and other system-specific constraints. CheepSync was implemented on custom designed nRF24Cheep beacon platforms (as broadcasters) and commercial off-the-shelf Android ported smartphones (as passive listeners). We demonstrate the efficacy of CheepSync by numerous empirical evaluations in a variety of experimental setups, and show that its average (single-hop) time synchronization accuracy is in the 10 \u03bcs range.",

   "abstract": "With the advances in IoT, future public safety responders will be well armed with devices that pump data between on-site responders and command centers, carrying useful information about the event scene, the status of a mission, and helping critical decisions to be made in real time. In addition, wearable and on-body sensors will monitor the vital signals and well being of the responders. These connected devices or the so-called IoT surrounding public safety responders generate highly vulnerable data, where security breaches may have life threatening consequences. Authentication of responder devices is essential in order to control access to public safety networks. Most of the existing authentication schemes do not scale well with the large number of devices of IoT, and are not fast enough to work during time-critical public safety missions. On the other hand, for general IoT services, cloud-based solutions provide unlimited resources for storing and accessing IoT data. However, the cloud may have some implications for sensitive data that are collected for public safety. Therefore, authentication solutions are desired to integrate well into the cloud environment. In this article, we propose cloud-centric, multi-level authentication as a service approach that addresses scalability and time constraints, and demonstrate its effectiveness. We draw future research directions for secure public safety networks in the presence of IoT devices and the cloud.",

   "abstract": "4G systems have been continuously evolving to cope with the emerging challenges of human-centric and M2M applications. Research has also now started on 5G systems. Scenarios have been proposed and initial requirements derived. 4G and beyond systems are expected to easily deliver a wide range of human-centric and M2M applications and services in a scalable, elastic, and cost-efficient manner. The 3GPP IMS was standardized as the service delivery platform for 3G networks. Unfortunately, it does not meet several requirements for provisioning applications and services in 4G and beyond systems. However, cloudifying it will certainly pave the way for its use as a service delivery platform for 4G and beyond. This article presents a critical overview of the architectures proposed so far for cloudifying the IMS. There are two classes of approaches; the first focuses on the whole IMS system, and the second deals with specific IMS entities. Research directions are also discussed. IMS granularity and a PaaS for the development and management of IMS functional entities are the two key directions we currently foresee.",

   "abstract": "CoAP is a lightweight RESTful application layer protocol devised for the IoT. Operating on top of UDP, CoAP must handle congestion control by itself. The core CoAP specification defines a basic congestion control mechanism, but it is not capable of adapting to network conditions. However, IoT scenarios exhibit significant resource constraints, which pose new challenges on the design of congestion control mechanisms. In this article we present CoCoA, an advanced congestion control mechanism for CoAP being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force CoRE working group. CoCoA introduces a novel round-trip time estimation technique, together with a variable backoff factor and aging mechanisms in order to provide dynamic and controlled retransmission timeout adaptation suitable for the peculiarities of IoT communications. We conduct a comparative performance analysis of CoCoA and a variety of alternative algorithms including state-of-the-art mechanisms developed for TCP. The study is based on experiments carried out in real testbeds. Results show that, in contrast to the alternative methods considered, CoCoA consistently outperforms the default CoAP congestion control mechanism in all evaluated scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Caching is an essential technique to improve throughput and latency in a vast variety of applications. The core idea is to duplicate content in memories distributed across the network, which can then be exploited to deliver requested content with less congestion and delay. The traditional role of cache memories is to deliver the maximal amount of requested content locally rather than from a remote server. While this approach is optimal for single-cache systems, it has recently been shown to be significantly suboptimal for systems with multiple caches (i.e., cache networks). Instead, cache memories should be used to enable a coded multicasting gain. In this article, we survey these recent developments. We discuss both the fundamental performance limits of cache networks and the practical challenges that need to be overcome in real-life scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Smart phones, tablets, and the rise of the Internet of Things are driving an insatiable demand for wireless capacity. This demand requires networking and Internet infrastructures to evolve to meet the needs of current and future multimedia applications. Wireless HetNets will play an important role toward the goal of using a diverse spectrum to provide high quality-of-service, especially in indoor environments where most data are consumed. An additional tier in the wireless HetNets concept is envisioned using indoor gigabit small-cells to offer additional wireless capacity where it is needed the most. The use of light as a new mobile access medium is considered promising. In this article, we describe the general characteristics of WiFi and VLC (or LiFi) and demonstrate a practical framework for both technologies to coexist. We explore the existing research activity in this area and articulate current and future research challenges based on our experience in building a proof-of-concept prototype VLC HetNet.",

   "abstract": "Electric vehicles use 10 to 25 kWh batteries. After their use in cars, these batteries are still in good condition to be used for energy storage in stationary applications and smart grid systems at all stages: generation, transmission, and distribution. However, before their reuse, there are some changes to be made on these batteries, such as those concerning communications. Electric vehicle batteries use a battery management system that controls functionality and safety, transmitting their condition and status, but also containing confidential information. This article studies two strategies to deal with communications difficulties in their second life as storage energy devices.",

   "abstract": "In future generation mobile systems, hyperdense small cell networks will be deployed to meet the tremendous growth of mobile traffic, in which interference is a key limitation. Interference alignment, IA, is a potential technique for interference management of small cell networks. However, there are still some practical challenges that hinder the development of IA-based small cell networks. On the other hand, to better cope with the shift from the sender-driven end-to-end communication paradigm to the receiver-driven content retrieval paradigm, content-centric communication has attracted great attention. Together with recent advances in computing, a communications, caching, and computing - 3C - oriented design paradigm for mobile networks is emerging. In this article, we propose a framework of 3C-oriented small cell networks with IA, in which caching and computing are exploited to simplify the network topology, improve the throughput, reduce the backhaul load, and guarantee the quality of experience of users. Furthermore, some research challenges are discussed for 3C-oriented small cell networks with IA.",

ICT can play a key role in disseminating such knowledge across the world. But a digital divide exists between urban and rural/remote areas, which results in economic and social disparities across regions. Developing last-mile telecommunication technologies for rural/remote areas is a crucial aspect in providing computing and ICT services that can integrate millions of stakeholders in rural/remote areas globally into the digital age, particularly with the advent of cloud computing. This article focuses on the different aspects of providing last-mile rural telecommunication access such as interfering factors, technology options, and deployment trends. This article aims to guide service providers, industry practitioners, and local entrepreneurs with a technology-and-deployment-trend analysis to choose, deploy, and operate suitable telecommunication networks depending on the unique features of the rural/remote area. Our goal is to bring attention to accessible and affordable technologies with practical considerations.",

   "abstract": "Successful execution of future network-centric military operations relies on effective enforcement of both need-to-know and responsibility- to-share principles. In modern military missions and coalitions, which have an increasingly agile character, a promising solution is to enforce security policies based on the properties of individual information objects - we call this approach content-based security. This article discusses the enforcement of content-based security policies at the different layers of the TCP/ IP model, and introduces a proof-of-concept implementation of a content-based protection and release mechanism in a software-defined networking environment. Our aim is to provide consistent enforcement of security policies across multiple system layers and multiple security dimensions (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). The results of an analysis of a concrete example of a software-defined network emulated in Mininet are encouraging and confirm the effectiveness of our approach with respect to improving protection of data in transit. The work presented in this article offers a basis for further research in this area.",

   "abstract": "In EONs, the establishment of flexi-grid optical connections requires configuring both BVTs and bandwidth variable cross-connects. Such configuration has to be performed through proper control plane architecture and extensions, accounting for the client signal data rate, the required modulation format, the adopted forwarding error correction mechanisms, the number of carriers, and the required spectrum resources. Nowadays, two candidate control plane architectures with similar functions (like endpoint and node addressing, automatic topology discovery, network abstraction, path computation, and connection provisioning) can be adopted: distributed GMPLS - with optional PCE and instantiation/modification - and a control plane based on SDN with a logically centralized controller and an open protocol such as OpenFlow. In this work, by relying on the data modeling of 1 Tb/s SBVTs, we aim to design and provide feasible control plane enhancements for both GMPLS/PCE and SDN/OpenFlow architectures to automatically configure endpoint SBVTs while dynamically establishing end-to-end connections in EONs. Such extensions, successfully validated in experimental scenarios, are qualitatively compared to ease eventual EON operator selection.",

   "abstract": "FTTdp networks using G.fast can complement the rollout of FTTH, especially in regions where the deployment of fiber inside the building is difficult. This article analyzes the main cost components of FTTdp networks with G.fast and the cost differences that can be achieved in comparison to FTTH networks. The two metrics employed in the article, the cost per home passed and the cost per home connected, were applied to six different geotypes that range from dense urban to rural scenarios. The results show that the cost per home passed of an FTTdp network with the distribution point located in the street is lower than the cost of FTTH. The cost per home connected for FTTdp is lower than that of FTTH for all of the scenarios studied. The cost reduction rates achieved by FTTdp networks are higher when employing a brownfield deployment scheme than when employing a greenfield deployment scheme.",

   "abstract": "The evolution of communication technology and the proliferation of electronic devices have rendered adversaries powerful means for targeted attacks via all sorts of accessible resources. In particular, due to the intrinsic interdependence and ubiquitous connectivity of modern communication systems, adversaries can devise malware that propagates through intermediate hosts to approach the target, to which we refer as transmissive attacks. Inspired by biology, the transmission pattern of such an attack in the digital space much resembles the spread of an epidemic in real life. This article describes transmissive attacks, summarizes the utility of epidemic models in communication systems, and draws connections between transmissive attacks and epidemic models. Simulations, experiments, and ongoing research challenges on transmissive attacks are also addressed.",

   "abstract": "Standards development organizations (SDOs) exist to assure the development of consensus- based, quality standards. These formal standards are needed in the telecommunications market to achieve functional interoperability. The standardization process takes years, and then a vendor still needs to implement the resulting standard in a product. This prevents service providers (SPs) who are willing to venture into new domains from doing so at a fast pace. With the development of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), opensource technology is emerging as a new option in the telecommunications market. In contrast to SDOs, open-source software (OSS) communities create a product that may implicitly define a de-facto standard based on market consensus. Therefore, SPs are drawn to OSS, but they face technical, procedural, legal, and cultural challenges due to their lack of experience with open software development. The question therefore arises, how the interaction between OSS communities, SDOs, and industry fora (IF) can be organized to tackle these challenges.",

   "abstract": "The unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel impose many challenges that limit the utilization of underwater sensor networks. In this context, opportunistic routing, which has been extensively investigated in terrestrial wireless ad hoc network scenarios, has greater potential for mitigating drawbacks from underwater acoustic communication and improving network performance. In this work, we discuss the two main building blocks for the design of opportunistic routing protocols for underwater sensor networks: candidate set selection and candidate coordination procedures. We propose classifying candidate set selection procedures into sender-side, receiver-side, and hybrid approaches, and candidate coordination procedures into timer-based and control-packet-based approaches. Based on this classification, we discuss particular characteristics of each approach and how they relate to underwater acoustic communication. Furthermore, we argue that those characteristics should be considered during the design of opportunistic routing protocols for different scenarios in underwater sensor networks.",

   "abstract": "Providing \"connectivity from the sky\" is the new innovative trend in wireless communications. High and low altitude platforms, drones, aircrafts, and airships are being considered as candidates for deploying wireless communications complementing the terrestrial communication infrastructure. In this article we report the detailed account of the design and implementation challenges of an aerial network consisting of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) base stations. In particular, we review achievements and innovations harnessed by an aerial network composed of Helikite platforms. Helikites can be raised in the sky to bring Internet access during special events and in the aftermath of an emergency. The trial phase of the system mounting LTE-A technology onboard Helikites to serve users on the ground yielded very encouraging results, and showed that such a system could offer a longer lasting solution, provided that inefficiency in powering the radio frequency equipment in the Helikite can be overcome.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we look into how the LTE network can efficiently evolve to cater for new data services by utilizing direct communications between mobile devices and extending the direct transmissions to the unlicensed bands, that is, D2D communications in conjunction with LTE-Unlicensed. In doing so, it provides an opportunity to solve the main challenge of mutual interference between D2D and CC transmissions. In this context, we review three interconnected major technical areas of multihop D2D: transmission band selection, routing path selection, and resource management. Traditionally, D2D transmissions are limited to specific regions of a cell's coverage area in order to limit the interference to CC primary links. We show that by allowing D2D to operate in the unlicensed bands with protective fairness measures for WiFi transmissions, D2D is able to operate across the whole coverage area and, in doing so, efficiently scale the overall network capacity while minimizing cross-tier and cross-technology interference.",

   "abstract": "Spectrally non-contiguous transmissions pose serious transceiver design challenges due to the nonlinear PA. When two or more non-contiguous carriers with close proximity are amplified by the same PA, spurious emissions inside or in the vicinity of the transmitter RF band are created. These spurious emissions may violate emission limits or otherwise compromise network coverage and reliability. Lowering the transmit power is a straightforward remedy, but it will reduce throughput, coverage, and power efficiency of the device. To improve linearity without sacrificing performance, several DPD techniques have recently been proposed to target the spurious emissions explicitly. These techniques are designed to minimize the computational and hardware complexity of DPD, thus making them better suited for mobile terminals and other lowcost devices. In this article, these recent advances in DPD for non-contiguous transmission scenarios are discussed, with a focus on mitigating the spurious emissions in the concrete example case of non-contiguous dual-carrier transmission. The techniques are compared to more traditional DPD approaches in terms of their computational and hardware complexities, as well as linearization performance.",

   "abstract": "One big challenge in building a smart grid arises from the fast growing amount of data and limited communication resources. The traditional centralized communication architecture does not scale well with the explosive increase of data and has a high probability of encountering communication bottlenecks due to long communication paths. To address this challenging issue, this article presents a distributed communication architecture that implements smart grid communications in an efficient and cost-effective way. This distributed architecture consists of multiple distributed operation centers, each of which is connected to several data concentrators serving one local area and only sends summary or required integrated information to a central operation center. Using this distributed architecture, communication distance is much shortened, and thus data will be delivered more efficiently and reliably. In addition, such a distributed architecture can manage and analyze data locally, rather than backhauling all raw data to the central operation center, leading to reduced cost and burden on communication resources. Advanced metering infrastructure is chosen as an example to demonstrate benefits of this architecture on improving communication performance. The distributed communication architecture is also readily applicable to other smart grid applications, for example, demand response management systems.",

   "abstract": "DC is one of the most important features introduced in Release 12 of the 3GPP specifications. DC aims at increasing the per-user throughput by improving the utilization of radio resources across two base stations connected via non-ideal backhaul (X2) and operating on different carrier frequencies. By making it possible to maintain the connection to the primary cell located in the macro base station while accessing the extra capacity provided by the small cell layer, DC can also improve the mobility performance in small cell deployments. This article gives an overview of the DC feature as standardized in Release 12. We summarize the supported scenarios and the DC functionality, and also demonstrate by means of detailed system-level simulations how DC can improve end-user throughput and mobility performance.",

   "abstract": "Wireless powered communication systems have recently attracted significant interest because of their potential to provide a ubiquitous and sustainable energy supply for communication networks. However, the energy that can be harvested from external energy sources is generally uncontrollable and intermittent. By allowing multiple devices to exchange their harvested energy, dynamic energy trading (DET) is introduced to improve the energy supply reliability and performance of wireless powered communication networks. This article provides an overview of the possible architecture and functional components that enable DET in communication networks. Various design issues on how to implement DET in practice are discussed. An optimal policy is proposed for delay-tolerant wireless powered communication networks in which each wireless powered device can schedule its data transmission and energy trading operations according to current and future energy availability. Finally, some potential topics and challenges for future research are highlighted.",

   "abstract": "Telecommunication network operators (TNOs) are seeing an exponential growth in mobile and fixed traffic, and on a growing scale need to manage (in some cases even manually) operational data silos. These silos necessitate a high degree of expensive operation that limits the ability to rapidly compose new innovative services, leads to high and exponentially growing integration expenses, and impairs the user experience for deployed services. All this is reducing long-term TNO profits. To meet this challenge, solutions employing network function virtualization (NFV) and software defined networking (SDN) have been proposed. However, different vendors of these solutions continue to deploy proprietary interfaces that are not interoperable with the new technology systems nor with legacy systems, thus further increasing the number of operational silos. To leverage existing efforts to provide new, high-quality services, we propose an innovative end-to-end service management framework called e2eUberIM. This framework contains a scalable, flexible, and volatile information model (UberIM) and a real-time, \"organic\" communication and storage process (e2eUber). It leverages the proprietary interfaces of different vendors, enabling the resulting enhanced operations system environment to automatically and in real-time optimize operational overhead while maximizing the user experience, and quickly field new innovative, composed \"any-services\" (XaaS). We document the e2eUberIM requirements and its design choices, as well as provide a set of implications for its successful implementation in operational, live TNO networks.",

   "abstract": "An Internet of Things system typically contains a large number of low-cost devices that are mainly powered by batteries and designed to operate for a relatively long period of time. Due to the stagnated battery technology, energy efficiency will still be a burning issue for future IoT systems. To achieve better energy efficiency, we propose an innovative sensor architecture called EcoSense. Unlike traditional software-based approaches (e.g., duty cycling or adaptive sampling techniques), EcoSense provides a hardware-based on-demand sensing mechanism that effectively eliminates the energy waste caused by a sensor working in sleep or standby mode. When desired events are not present, an EcoSense sensor is completely turned off to save energy (i.e., drawing zero current). When desired events occur, an on-demand connection module will harvest energy from the events and reactivate the sensor. We implemented light- and RF-driven EcoSense sensors, and evaluated their performance in realworld experiments. Experimental results show that the EcoSense technique is able to immediately detect lights and RF signals, and offers reasonable reaction distances.",

Specifically, each BS is connected to a fog node, which provides computing resources locally. On the top of the fog nodes, the SDN-based cellular core is designed to facilitate packet forwarding among fog nodes. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical fog computing architecture in each fog node to provide flexible IoT services while maintaining user privacy: each user's IoT devices are associated with a proxy VM (located in a fog node), which collects, classifies, and analyzes the devices' raw data streams, converts them into metadata, and transmits the metadata to the corresponding application VMs (which are owned by IoT service providers). Each application VM receives the corresponding metadata from different proxy VMs and provides its service to users. In addition, a novel proxy VM migration scheme is proposed to minimize the traffic in the SDNbased core.",

   "abstract": "Current radio access network architectures, characterized by a static configuration and deployment of base stations, have exposed their limitations in handling the temporal and geographical fluctuations of capacity demand. Moreover, small cell networks have exacerbated the problem of electromagnetic interference and decreased the energy efficiency. Although there are some solutions to alleviate these problems, they still suffer from static provisioning of BSs and lack of inter-BS communication. Cloud RAN is a new centralized paradigm based on virtualization technology that has emerged as a promising architecture and efficiently addresses such problems. C-RAN provides high energy efficiency together with gigabit-per-second data rates across software defined wireless networks. In this article, novel reconfigurable solutions based on C-RAN are proposed in order to adapt dynamically and efficiently to the fluctuations in per-user capacity demand. Co-location models for provisioning and allocation of virtual base stations are introduced, and pros and cons of different VBS architectures are studied. Also, the potential advantages of VBS clustering and consolidation to support recently proposed cooperative techniques like cooperative multipoint processing are discussed.",

   "abstract": "New-generation industries heavily rely on big data to improve their efficiency. Such big data are commonly collected by smart nodes and transmitted to the cloud via wireless. Due to the limited size of smart node, the shortage of energy is always a critical issue, and the wireless data transmission is extremely a big power consumer. Aiming to reduce the energy consumption in wireless, this article introduces a potential breach from data redundancy. If redundant data are no longer collected, a large amount of wireless transmissions can be cancelled and their energy saved. Motivated by this breach, this article proposes a compressive-sensing-based collection framework to minimize the amount of collection while guaranteeing data quality. This framework is verified by experiments and extensive real-trace-driven simulations.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables collective data harvesting actions by coordinating citizens willing to contribute data collected via their sensor-rich smartphones that represent sources of valuable sensing information in urban environments nowadays. One of the biggest challenges in a real long-running MCS system lies in the capacity not only to attract new volunteers, but also, and most importantly, to leverage existing social ties between volunteers to keep them involved to build long-lasting MCS communities. In addition, the advent of high-performing devices and ad hoc communication technologies can help to further amplify the effect of sensing actions in proximity of the volunteer devices. This article originally describes how to exploit these socio-technical networking aspects to increase the performance of MCS campaigns in the ParticipAct living laboratory, an ongoing MCS real-world experiment that involved about 170 students of the University of Bologna for more than two years. The article also reports some significant experimental results to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",

To enable fast beamforming training and tracking, we first investigate a hierarchical structure of beamforming codebooks and design of hierarchical codebooks with different beam widths via sub-array techniques. We next examine the Doppler effect as a result of UAV movement and find that the Doppler effect may not be catastrophic when high gain directional transmission is used. We further explore the use of mmWave spatial-division multiple access and demonstrate its clear advantage in improving the cellular network capacity. We also explore different ways of dealing with signal blockage and point out that possible adaptive UAV cruising algorithms would be necessary to counteract signal blockage. Finally, we identify a close relationship between UAV positioning and directional mmWave user discovery, where update of the former may directly impact the latter and vice versa.",

   "abstract": "The fiber-wireless (FiWi) enhanced LTE-A HetNet, which consists of fiber optic networks as its backhaul and LTE-A HetNets as its wireless front-end, is regarded as a promising technique for a 5G radio access network to host large-scale mobile data transmission. In order to reduce the energy consumption of a FiWi enhanced LTE-A HetNet, we should offload the traffic of lightly loaded BSs to other active BSs and turn them into sleep state, while in order to provide stable service to more user equipments (UEs), we should put as many BSs into active state as possible. Obviously, there is a trade-off between minimizing the energy consumption and maximizing the number of UEs associated with the BSs. However, previous research works either focused on energy consumption minimization or placed emphasis on UE connection maximization, and few of them integrate these two parts together and give an optimal solution. Toward this end, this article studies the issues in energy consumption minimization with the UE connection constraint in FiWi enhanced LTE-A HetNets, and propose a heuristic greedy solution to find an optimal list of active BSs and their associated UEs.",

   "abstract": "With the rapid development of EVs and their penetration in our modern society, the energy management issues in the smart grid integrated with EVs are attracting more and more research interest. Most of the existing literature only involves two-sided interactions between the EVs and the power grid or the smart home/buildings in the DSM investigation. In fact, however, similar to EVs, when equipped with distributed renewable energy sources and electricity storage facilities, SCs can also be regarded as either energy consumers or energy providers with their individual rationality. This can lead to increased flexibility of the energy management and power trading in the power system involving both EVs and SCs. In this article, we propose a three-party architecture for the smart grid integrated with EVs, involving complex and flexible interactions among the power grid, EVs, and SCs. Based on the proposed three-party architecture, we introduce two interesting systems, SC-centered and EV-centered systems, and further propose a schedule-upon-request energy management framework to achieve effective and intelligent energy management in the power system involving both EVs and SCs. Feasible optimization methods for energy management problems in this framework are also summarized.",

   "abstract": "Future networks will comprise a large number of inter-connected heterogeneous devices that will receive ubiquitous multimedia services over integrated but diverse wireless network technologies. In this context, optimization of multimedia broadcast transmissions based on network resources and user-end constraints (price sensitivity, device display, and limited battery) is essential to ensure high QoE. This article discusses underlying challenges, and suggests hybrid system architecture and potential cross-layer adaptive unified solutions for energy-efficient and QoE-aware digital television broadcast services in future heterogeneous network environments. Experimental and architecture-level simulation studies of the cross-layer adaptive strategies demonstrate an increase in user equipment energy saving, QoE, and number of multimedia broadcast/multicast users being served.",

   "abstract": "Designated for public safety communications, device-to-device (D2D) proximity services (ProSe) have emerged as one of the most innovative technologies in 3GPP Release 12 and 13. When some or all infrastructures are unavailable, Release 12 D2D ProSe supports direct data exchanges between user equipments (UEs) without signal relays via eNBs. As a further enhancement, Release 13 D2D ProSe subsequently supports two-hop UE relays and priority control for mission-critical multimedia applications. With these particular features, D2D ProSe has been regarded as the key foundation toward the next generation social-aware communication and networking paradigm. To fully comprehend this innovation, in this article we provide comprehensive knowledge about D2D ProSe, with essential physical channels and mechanisms in Release 12, and UE-to-network relay as well as priority control in Release 13. By investigating the system-level performance of the Release 13 D2D designs, open issues are further revealed. The provided insights facilitate the practice and incorporation of D2D ProSe into the state-of-the-art and future cellular network evolutions.",

   "abstract": "Mission-critical communications for public safety (PS) is of significant interest and a very high priority item for various organizations such as national regulatory agencies, telecom service providers, network vendors, device manufacturers, and third party public safety service providers. LTE has been selected as the next-generation platform to support new mission-critical realtime broadband services to the PS community [1]. To address high performance and seamless user experience, LTE networks interwork with Wi-Fi for direct communication. Wi-Fi Direct provides the ability to create groups for efficient dissemination of information needed for critical communication directly between devices. In realizing LTE for PS, it is also necessary to provide enhanced interworking between LTE and Wi-Fi for adequate emergency group communication. This article provides an overview of the PS-related efforts in 3GPP, interworking aspects of LTE, Wi-Fi and its application to PS, as well as a mechanism to enhance the interworking between the two technologies to deliver an effective solution for mission-critical communication and applications.",

In this article, we design a proximity communications enhanced multilayer caching and delivery architecture. Then merits possessed by the proposed architecture are highlighted, and challenges and open issues are comprehensively presented. Specifically, we shed light on the trade-offs between key performance indicators (e.g., hit ratio, latency, and coverage) and operation costs (e.g., device storage space, wireless bandwidth, and device battery life), and then clarify fundamental coupling between content caching and delivery. To further verify the effectiveness of the cooperation among SBSs and user equipments, we propose a distributed content caching and delivery strategy, jointly considering popularity distribution, diverse storage capability, and user mobility. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can significantly lower the content retrieval latency and reduce the traffic flowing to core networks. Furthermore, design details of the experimental testbed are presented, and the validity of our developed strategy is verified.",

   "abstract": "Cloud radio access network systems, consisting of remote radio heads densely distributed in a coverage area and connected by optical fibers to a cloud infrastructure with large computational capabilities, have the potential to meet the ambitious objectives of next generation mobile networks. Actual implementations of C-RANs tackle fundamental technical and economic challenges. In this article, we present an end-to-end solution for practically implementable C-RANs by providing innovative solutions to key issues such as the design of cost-effective hardware and power-effective signals for RRHs, efficient design and distribution of data and control traffic for coordinated communications, and conception of a flexible and elastic architecture supporting dynamic allocation of both the densely distributed RRHs and the centralized processing resources in the cloud to create virtual base stations. More specifically, we propose a novel antenna array architecture called load-controlled parasitic antenna array (LCPAA) where multiple antennas are fed by a single RF chain. Energy- and spectral-efficient modulation as well as signaling schemes that are easy to implement are also provided. Additionally, the design presented for the fronthaul enables flexibility and elasticity in resource allocation to support BS virtualization. A layered design of information control for the proposed end-to-end solution is presented. The feasibility and effectiveness of such an LCPAA-enabled C-RAN system setup has been validated through an over-the-air demonstration.",

   "abstract": "In tactical missions, seamless and effective communication is crucial for mission success. For future deployed networks, the user experience can be improved with proper resource allocation mechanisms, taking into consideration quality of service characteristics of the traffic. Such a resource allocation method requires knowledge of the key performance indicators of the communication path. In this article, we present a framework for the key performance indicator estimation service for deployed heterogeneous networks. Our proposal utilizes several different approaches for measuring key performance indicators. Several mechanisms are used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the service. We also discuss the lessons learned during the key performance indicator estimation service implementation and the validation process.",

While SDN is of great importance to ISPs, it is infeasible to replace the entire existing infrastructure with a clean slate of SDN design. Most early SDN practices concentrate on small-scale greenfield designs. Here, we focus on mission-critical large-scale backbone networks, and discuss the key technologies and applications for ISPs' SDN adoption. Taking an evolutionary viewpoint, we discuss strategies and approaches to integrate SDN capabilities with traditional technologies to achieve the high-performance traffic engineering, fast service provisioning, and rapid failure restoration required for existing network operations.",

   "abstract": "Cell splitting is an effective way of implementing network densification in order to boost the capacity of a mobile system. Traditionally, the cell splitting procedure has been carried out in the azimuth dimension. However, another approach known as vertical sectorization has been gaining momentum recently, where the sectors of a conventional cellular system are split vertically instead, creating inner and outer cells by using AAS technology. Then vertical sectorization can use the same communication resources in both inner and outer parts of the cells. Performance of vertical sectorization has been extensively studied in the literature using advanced system simulations. However, field measurements to characterize the actual performance of vertical sectorization with AAS have been scarce so far. In this article, we first identify key issues that may hinder the smooth implementation of commercial cellular systems using vertical sectorization. Then we present the results of a measurement campaign that was carried out to study these limitations and to identify the actual vertical radiation patterns when AAS technology is used. Finally, we reflect on some problems that remain open to make future cellular systems using vertical sectorization with AAS commercially viable.",

   "abstract": "The rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) deployment has posed unprecedented challenges to the underlying network design. We envision that tomorrow's global-scale IoT systems will focus on service-oriented data sharing and processing rather than point-to-point data collection. Requirements such as global reachability, mobility, communication diversity, and security will also develop naturally along with the change in the communication patterns. However, existing (IP-based) networks focus only on locations and point-to-point channels. The mismatch between the dynamic requirements and the functionalities provided by the network renders IoT communication inefficient and inconvenient. Information-centric networking (ICN) shifts the focus from location to the (identity of) information. This paradigm can naturally be adapted to IoT communication since service can also be identified as a type of information. To demonstrate the potential of ICN in IoT communication, this article adopts and modifies a particular example of ICN called MobilityFirst, and shows that the target architecture can satisfy the requirements posed by IoT communication. Similar adaptations can also be used by other ICN architectures such as NDN and XIA.",

   "abstract": "Decisive progress in 5G mobile technology, fueled by a rapid proliferation of computation- hungry and delay-sensitive services, puts economic pressure on the research community to rethink the fundamentals of underlying networking architectures. Along these lines, the first half of this article offers a first-hand tutorial on the most recent advances in content-centric networking, emerging user applications, as well as enabling system architectures. We establish that while significant progress has been made along the individual vectors of communications, caching, and computing, together with some promising steps in proposing hybrid functionalities, the ultimate synergy behind a fully integrated solution is not nearly well understood. Against this background, the second half of this work carefully brings into perspective additional important factors, such as user mobility patterns, aggressive application requirements, and associated operator deployment capabilities, to conduct comprehensive system-level analysis. Furthermore, supported by a full-fledged practical trial on a live cellular network, our systematic findings reveal the most dominant factors in converged 5G-grade communications, caching, and computing layouts, as well as indicate the natural optimization points for system operators to leverage the maximum available benefits.",

Conceptually, it also allows a transition between block-based multicarrier and single-carrier schemes when multiple DFT-spread blocks are employed in the structure. Recently, it has been shown that DFT-S-OFDM can also accommodate an internal guard period that offers flexibility on the duration of the guard periods without affecting the symbol duration. In this article, we present further modifications of DFT-S-OFDM that offer improvements in flexibility and discuss the latest enabling techniques on this topic. Considering the flexibility introduced by DFTs-OFDM and its variations, the DFT-S-OFDM family also offers a set of promising waveforms for 5G networks, which will require a flexible physical layer.",

   "abstract": "The ever-increasing traffic demand is pushing network operators to find new cost-efficient solutions toward the deployment of future 5G mobile networks. The network sharing paradigm was explored in the past and partially deployed. Nowadays, advanced mobile network multi-tenancy approaches are increasingly gaining momentum, paving the way toward further decreasing capital expenditure and operational expenditure (CAPEX/OPEX) costs, while enabling new business opportunities. This article provides an overview of the 3GPP standard evolution from network sharing principles, mechanisms, and architectures to future on-demand multi-tenant systems. In particular, it introduces the concept of the 5G Network Slice Broker in 5G systems, which enables mobile virtual network operators, over-the-top providers, and industry vertical market players to request and lease resources from infrastructure providers dynamically via signaling means. Finally, it reviews the latest standardization efforts, considering remaining open issues for enabling advanced network slicing solutions, taking into account the allocation of virtualized network functions based on ETSI NFV, the introduction of shared network functions, and flexible service chaining.",

   "abstract": "Sensor networks have successfully been used for wildlife monitoring and tracking of different species. When it comes to small animals such as smaller birds, mammals, or even insects, the current approach is to use extremely lightweight RF tags located using radio telemetry. A new quantum leap in technology is needed to overcome this limitation and enable new ways to observe larger numbers of small animals. In an interdisciplinary team, we are working on the different aspects of such a new technology. In particular, we report on our findings on a sensor- network-based tracking solution for bats. Our system is based on integrated localization and wireless communication protocols for ultra-lowpower systems. This requires coding techniques for improved reliability as well as ranging solutions for tracking hunting bats. We address the technological and methodical problems related to system design, software support, and protocol design. First field experiments have been conducted that showcase the capabilities of our system.",

   "abstract": "5G networks are expected to bring the gigabits per second throughput level per user to reality by 2020. This is done using a combination of new and well known technologies such as C-RAN, self-organizing networks, ultra dense networks, massive MIMO, and millimeter waves. In new RAN architectures, C-RAN has been viewed as a promising 5G architecture that centralizes baseband processing units and virtualizes them into a resource pool. The baseband units are connected to the remote radio heads via high speed fronthaul links. Failure of any 5G cell site fronthaul means the loss of hundreds of gigabits, or even terabits. In this article, we present a novel cell outage compensation approach using new SHRs added to each cell site in the 5G network. These SHRs operate only in case of fronthaul/ backhaul failure of any cell site in the network. A new software defined controller is introduced to handle the self-healing procedures. The article also introduces a high-level simulation study that is carried out to assess the proposed approach. The simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of the degree of recovery from failures.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we address the challenges of transmitter-receiver isolation in mobile full-duplex devices, building on shared-antenna-based transceiver architecture. First, self-adaptive analog RF cancellation circuitry is required, since the ability to track time-varying self-interference coupling characteristics is of utmost importance in mobile devices. In addition, novel adaptive nonlinear DSP methods are also required for final self-interference suppression at digital baseband, since mobile-scale devices typically operate under highly nonlinear low-cost RF components. In addition to describing the above kind of advanced circuit and signal processing solutions, comprehensive RF measurement results from a complete demonstrator implementation are also provided, evidencing beyond 40 dB of active RF cancellation over an 80 MHz waveform bandwidth with a highly nonlinear transmitter power amplifier. Measured examples also demonstrate the good self-healing characteristics of the developed control loop against fast changes in the coupling channel. Furthermore, when complemented by nonlinear digital cancellation processing, the residual self-interference level is pushed down to the noise floor of the demonstration system, despite the harsh nonlinear nature of the self-interference. These findings indicate that deploying the full-duplex principle can indeed also be feasible in mobile devices, and thus be one potential technology in, for example, 5G and beyond radio systems.",

   "abstract": "Recently proposed wireless proactive caching has opened up a promising avenue for reducing the redundant traffic load of the future wireless network. In addition to infrastructure updating, caching schemes for different wireless caching scenarios are also essential problems of concern. Along with the benefits brought by proactive caching, the cost of proactive caching should also be taken into account, since caching schemes can be influenced by different interest relevant parties in wireless networks. In this article, we discuss several typical caching scenarios and apply corresponding game theoretical models to illustrate how the selfishness of different parties may influence the overall wireless proactive caching. Efficient caching strategies can be designed by carefully considering the relations and interactions among these parties by using game theory. We also outline possible future research directions in this emerging area.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the challenges in designing a communication network robust against earthquake-induced disasters. Due to the heterogeneity of local geology conditions, an earthquake may cause different devastating effects on network links at different locations. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a network design method that, based on actual seismic hazard information, finds appropriate geographical routes for network links under a cost constraint to maximize the robustness of the network. We carried out experiments on local as well as nationwide networks considering many possible earthquake scenarios in Japan. The results suggest that the shortest route is often the optimal route, and, in some cases, long detour routes can significantly reduce the average end-to-end disconnection probability compared to the shortest route solutions. This gives a network operator guidelines to design a network that is resilient against earthquake disasters at the lowest possible cost.",

A number of energy-efficient TCAM usage approaches have been proposed in recent literature, but this topic still has not been well studied in the context of traffic engineering for SDN. To this end, aiming to find energy-efficient routing paths for traffic sessions in SDN networks, we propose a novel Green DataPath architecture, where the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) power management technique is introduced. The dedicated SDN controlling module and DVFS-enabled switches are devised for the control plane and data plane, respectively. A framework for energy-efficient routing algorithms is also developed under the proposed architecture and evaluated by extensive simulations using three traffic scheduling schemes.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) can support collaboration and communication between objects automatically. However, with the increasing number of involved devices, IoT systems may consume substantial amounts of energy. Thus, the relevant energy efficiency issues have recently been attracting much attention from both academia and industry. In this article we adopt an energy-efficient architecture for Industrial IoT (IIoT), which consists of a sense entities domain, RESTful service hosted networks, a cloud server, and user applications. Under this architecture, we focus on the sense entities domain where huge amounts of energy are consumed by a tremendous number of nodes. The proposed framework includes three layers: the sense layer, the gateway layer, and the control layer. This hierarchical framework balances the traffic load and enables a longer lifetime of the whole system. Based on this deployment, a sleep scheduling and wake-up protocol is designed, supporting the prediction of sleep intervals. The shifts of states support the use of the entire system resources in an energy-efficient way. Simulation results demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed architecture in resource utilization and energy consumption.",

In the former aspect, NSNs will dissolve in an aqueous environment after finishing designated tasks and are harmless to the environment. In the latter aspect, NSNs employ cross-scale interfaces to interconnect the in vivo environment and its external environment. Specifically, the in-messaging and out-messaging interfaces for nanorobots to interact with a macro-unit are defined. The propagation and transient characteristics of nanorobots are described based on the existing experimental results. Furthermore, planning of nanorobot paths is discussed by taking into account the effectiveness of region-of-interest detection and the period of surveillance. Finally, a case study on how NSNs may be applied to microwave breast cancer detection is presented.",

   "abstract": "An alarm system is a fundamental application of IWSNs. Most of the existing literature focuses on reliability and quality of service of alarm systems. In addition, timeliness is another big concern for alarm systems considering the serious consequences of various emergencies. However, with the explosion of energy consumption, energy efficiency is becoming more and more important for IWSNs. Improving energy efficiency effectively without reducing other performance of alarm systems is a severe challenge. In this article, we design a novel green framework of alarm systems for the industrial field based on the IWSN. The proposed framework is composed of two parts, the IWSN and the security sector, which are connected through wireless links. The main responsibility of the IWSN is to monitor and track emergency and deliver the collected data to the security sector; the main responsibility of the security sector is to store and analyze the received data stream, and send requests to the IWSN. In IWSN, sleeping schedules and routing algorithms are designed carefully to improve the energy efficiency, reliability, and timeliness of alarm systems. Tracking emergencies and reducing redundant nodes are also necessary. The security sector stores and analyzes a data stream, and then evaluates an emergency situation. At last, the estimated emergency situation is used to trigger some corresponding actions to tackle the emergency.",

This article proposes a new architecture of SDIN and then presents the related key technologies. The proposed architecture adopts an all-IP-based flat structure, and can adaptively reconfigure networks according to the dynamic change of product orders. The crucial technologies can guarantee real-time data transmission, enable plug-and-play, and support wireless access with seamless handover capability. Energy can be reduced significantly by optimizing routes and shutting down redundant production lines. Experimental results show that our solution can achieve highly reliable and deterministic packet delivery. With the adaptive configurations in the testbed, SDIN can consume 18 percent-less energy than traditional industrial networks.",

The reduction of unnecessary energy emitted by industrial networks can be a possible solution to many environmental issues. Green industrial networking is in its infancy, and an overview of the domain is still lacking. In this article, we discuss recent advances in industrial and green networking paradigms to investigate the impact on global communities. We also classify the literature by devising a taxonomy based on networking technologies, machines, network types, topologies, field bus types, transmission media, and hierarchical levels. Moreover, we identify and discuss key enablers (adaptive links, resource-based energy conservation, energy-efficient scheduling, energy-aware systems, energy-aware proxying, energy-conservative approaches, and low-power wireless protocols) for green industrial networking. Furthermore, we discuss challenges that remain to be addressed as future research directions.",

   "abstract": "Long Term Evolution, which has its roots in commercial mobile communications, has recently become an influential solution to future public safety communications. To verify the feasibility of LTE for public safety, it is essential to investigate whether an LTE system optimized for one-to-one communications is capable of providing group communication, which is one of the most important service concepts in public safety. In general, a number of first responders for public safety need to form a group for communicating with each other or sharing common data for collaboration on their mission. In this article, we analyze how the current LTE system can support group communication from the aspect of radio access. Based on the requirements for group communication, we validate whether each LTE-enabled radio access method can efficiently support group communication. In addition, we propose a new multicast transmission scheme, called index-coded HARQ. By applying the index coding concept to HARQ operations, we show that the LTE system can provide group communication that is more sophisticated in terms of radio resource efficiency and scalability. We finally evaluate the performance of LTE-enabled group communication using several radio access methods and show how the proposed transmission scheme enhances performance via system-level simulations.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a large push in the U.S. Department of Defense to move to an all-IP infrastructure, particularly on the tactical edge. IP and associated protocols were designed primarily for wired networks tied to fixed infrastructure. Although extensions to support MANET have received decades of research, in practice, there are few successful implementations. Challenges include handling mobility, managing lossy links, and scaling to large numbers of users. Unfortunately, these are the exact conditions military tactical edge networks must operate within: high mobility, high loss, and large numbers of users. To address the needs and particular challenges of military tactical edge information sharing requirements, we consider a new class of networking approaches called group-centric networks that focuses on dynamic and resilient formation of interest groups. The structure of tactical networks limits the majority of collaboration and network traffic to within a group of users that share a set of common interests (i.e., platoons, 4-ships, etc.). These groups are formed either prior to the mission or on the fly with only a minor amount of traffic flowing outside of these groups. Group-centric networking approaches can help connect users in military tactical edge networks. In addition, we also discuss an instantiation of a group-centric network protocol called Group Centric Networking (GCN), compare GCN against a traditional MANET routing approach on a 90-node Android mobile phone testbed, and discuss implications for tactical edge users.",

   "abstract": "Edge caching and the centralization of baseband processing by means of the C-RAN architecture are among the most promising and transformative trends in the evolution of wireless networks. A key advantage of C-RAN is the possibility to perform cooperative transmission across multiple edge nodes, such as small cell base stations, thanks to centralized cloud processing. Cloud processing, however, comes at the cost of the potentially large delay entailed by fronthaul transmission between edge and cloud. In contrast, edge caching enables the low-latency transmission of popular multimedia content, but at the cost of constraining the operation of the edge nodes to decentralized transmission strategies with limited interference management capabilities. In order to accommodate the broad range of quality of service requirements of mobile broadband communication, in terms of spectral efficiency and latency, that are envisioned to be within the scope of 5G systems and beyond, this article considers a hybrid architecture, referred to as fog RAN (F-RAN), that harnesses the benefits of, and the synergies between, edge caching and C-RAN. In an F-RAN, edge nodes may be endowed with caching capabilities, while at the same time being controllable from a central cloud processor as in a C-RAN. In this article, an information-theoretic framework is presented that aims to characterize the main trade-offs between performance of an F-RAN, in terms of worst case delivery latency, and its resources: caching and fronthaul capacities.",

   "abstract": "As the number of electronic components in the car increases, the requirement for the higher data transmission scheme among them is on the sharp rise. The control area network (CAN) has been widely adopted to support the in-car communications needs but the data rate is far below what other schemes such as Ethernet and optical fibers can offer. A new scheme for enhancing the speed of CANs has been proposed, where a carrier modulated signal is introduced on top of the existing CAN signal, whereby the data rate can be enhanced over 100 Mb/s. The proposed scheme is compatible with the existing CAN network and accordingly enables seamless upgrade of the existing network to support high-speed demand using CAN protocol. ",

   "abstract": "Software-defined multi-gigahertz receivers require high-speed ADCs at the frontend. Time interleaving has emerged as the most common method of achieving ultra-fast quantization at reasonably high resolution. However, this multi-path solution introduces systematic errors due to mismatches in signal paths, whereas in non-interleaved versions these were mixed to DC, where they appeared as a harmless offset. Mitigating all possible time-interleaved errors comes at a heavy cost in complexity, risk, and power. Knowing which errors are most important and which can be neglected in any given application is essential for picking an appropriate architecture and calibration scheme. Guidelines for reducing errors lead to potentially different architecture choices. When the goal is to use the fewest slices, an inerleaved pipelined ADC results, whereas when the overriding objective is to use the simplest slice possible, a large array of SAR slices is usually adopted. Both approaches have merit. This article addresses when and where to use each approach by discussing specification requirements and showing that different types of error sources should not be merged into one single metric like ENOB, but should be treated separately to determine their impact on overall system performance. An example of an eight-way interleaved pipelined ADC is presented, which illustrates these principles in the context of a real circuit.",

   "abstract": "Historical fragmentation in spectrum access models accentuates the need for novel concepts that allow for efficient sharing of already available but underutilized spectrum. The emerging LSA regulatory framework is expected to enable more advanced spectrum sharing between a limited number of users while guaranteeing their much needed interference protection. However, the ultimate benefits of LSA may in practice be constrained by space-time availability of the LSA bands. Hence, more dynamic LSA spectrum management is required to leverage such realtime variability and sustain reliability when, for example, the original spectrum user suddenly revokes the previously granted frequency bands as they are required again. In this article, we maintain the vision of highly dynamic LSA architecture and rigorously study its future potential, from reviewing market opportunities and discussing available technology implementations to conducting performance evaluation of LSA dynamics and outlining the standardization landscape. Our investigations are based on a comprehensive system-level evaluation framework, which has been specifically designed to assess highly dynamic LSA deployments.",

These methods have the unusual and useful ability to detect anomalies rapidly, with very little memory, and using only very local information. Our research investigates the potential for a self-organizing anomaly detection system inspired by those observed naturally in colonies of honey bees. We provide a summary of findings from a recently presented algorithm for a nonparametric, fully distributed coordination framework that translates the biological success of these methods into analogous operations for use in cyber defense and discuss the features that inspired this translation. We explore the impacts on detection performance of the defined range of distributed communication for each node and of involving only a small percentage of total nodes in the network in the distributed detection communication. We evaluate our algorithm using a software-based testing implementation, and demonstrate up to 20 percent improvement in detection capability over parallel isolated anomaly detectors.",

   "abstract": "Rapid increases in bandwidth-intensive communications on mobile devices is challenging the Internet's scalability. Mobile converged networking, with its threefold convergence of technology, service, and network, is receiving significant attention as a potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, proposed mobile convergence approaches are limited by the prevailing IP-based Internet infrastructure. The inherently host-centric IP lacks scalability to accommodate an explosion in multimedia content traffic, especially in the context of mobile convergence. Information-centric networking, a new networking paradigm, has been proposed to overcome IP's scalability problems. By routing requests and data using content names instead of host addresses, information-centric networking enables the exploitation of in-network caching, multi-homing, and multiple radio technologies, and avoids the restrictions of a host-centric foundation. We believe that information- centric networking can play a central role in a mobile converged network. We use named data networking, a popular information- centric networking architecture, as the foundation for a novel information-centric mobile converged network (IC-MCN). Our architecture allows different networks, multiple interfaces, and in-network caching to all be leveraged effectively by mobile devices. We discuss the details of the architecture, identify its advantages, and explore open challenges to the creation of a practical IC-MCN for the future.",

   "abstract": "We present the results, experiences, and takeaways from comparing a diverse set of dynamic spectrum access methods during the IEEE DySPAN 2015 spectrum challenge. Five solutions for coexistence with a given wireless link were implemented and tested in an unknown environment during the conference in Stockholm. The challenge was framed broadly, enabling participants to use their own hardware, antennas, physical layer, or medium access control solutions to compete in a unified setup. Each solution was run two times and ranked using a single metric. Between the two runs the teams were allowed to improve their solution. The metric considered wanted throughput and unwanted interference. In addition to the metric, all solutions were evaluated by a jury. In this article, we give a detailed overview of the challenge, how we organized it, the participating teams, and finally the winners. We conclude with some takeaways on dynamic spectrum access.",

We consider UWOC multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multiple light sources and detectors, and focus on the impulse response that is capable of characterizing the temporal behavior of UWOC links. We propose a weighted Gamma function polynomial (WGFP) to model the impulse response of general UWOC MIMO links with arbitrary numbers of light sources and detectors. Numerical results of Monte Carlo simulations have validated the proposed WGFP model in a turbid water environment.",

   "abstract": "UWA channels exhibit time-varying multipath characteristics. To this end, OFDM is well known for its robustness against multipath channels but is prone to ICI induced by time variation. More recently, inspired by spatial modulation, the so-called IM-OFDM has also been proposed to provide higher system throughput than plain OFDM under certain conditions. A key feature of IM-OFDM is that partial subcarriers are kept inactive. This could potentially improve system performance in the presence of ICI. Leveraging on this, we are the first to propose IM-OFDM for UWA communications. On the other hand, however, we realize that ICI could potentially lead to energy leakage from active subcarriers to inactive ones, and impair the demodulation of IM-OFDM. In this article, we introduce IM-OFDM for UWA communications and propose a hybrid IM-OFDM scheme with improved spectral efficiency. We then review existing ICI self-cancellation techniques for generic OFDM, and propose a new ICI cancellation method for IM-OFDM.",

Massive MIMO systems, filter bank multi-carrier modulation, relaying technologies, and millimeter-wave communications have been considered as some of the strong candidates for the physical layer design of 5G networks. In this article, we shed light on the potential and implementation of IM techniques for MIMO and multi-carrier communications systems, which are expected to be two of the key technologies for 5G systems. Specifically, we focus on two promising applications of IM: spatial modulation and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with IM, and discuss the recent advances and future research directions in IM technologies toward spectrum- and energy-efficient 5G wireless networks.",

   "abstract": "Broadband-technology-based critical communications networks are predicted and known to generate significant direct returns. Less attention is given to their potential to generate long term indirect returns in the form of various socioeconomic benefits. This article focuses on identifying such indirect returns, and suggests that they are included in financial and economic viability analyses for better accuracy in the cost-benefit analyses of broadband critical communications networks. Developing a net present value model that accounts for both direct and indirect benefits, the article suggests that broadband critical communications networks can be highly beneficial and desirable to implement, particularly from the public and social points of view.",

With the use of wireless smart cameras and vision technologies, applications such as remote visual monitoring and surveillance, intelligent logistics product tracking, image guided automated assembly, and fault detection can be realized. Vision capabilities can enable robots, machines, and other industrial automation systems to meaningfully interact with objects and safely navigate through their surroundings. Allowing them to adapt to changing manufacturing-line conditions opens a wide range of new industrial automation applications. In this article, we discuss the opportunities, challenges, and design principles of industrial wireless communication over the mmWave spectrum. Open research issues are identified and discussed.

   "abstract": "Mobile devices are often presented with multiple connectivity options, usually making a selection either randomly or based on the wireless medium's conditions, as is the case for current offloading schemes. In this article we propose that link-layer connectivity can be associated with information availability and in this respect connectivity decisions should be information-aware. To achieve information awareness at the link layer, we leverage on the information-centric networking paradigm and introduce the concept of information-centric connectivity (ICCON). We elaborate on different types of information availability and connectivity decisions in the context of ICCON, present specific use cases, and discuss emerging opportunities, challenges, and technical approaches. We illustrate the potential benefits of ICCON through preliminary simulation and numerical results in an example use case.",

   "abstract": "In the connected vehicle ecosystem, a high volume of information-rich and safety-critical data will be exchanged by roadside units and onboard transceivers to improve the driving and traveling experience. However, poor-quality wireless links and the mobility of vehicles highly challenge data delivery. The IP address-centric model of the current Internet barely works in such extremely dynamic environments and poorly matches the localized nature of the majority of vehicular communications, which typically target specific road areas (e.g., in the proximity of a hazard or a point of interest) regardless of the identity/address of a single vehicle passing by. Therefore, a paradigm shift is advocated from traditional IP-based networking toward the groundbreaking information- centric networking. In this article, we scrutinize the applicability of this paradigm in vehicular environments by reviewing its core functionalities and the related work. The analysis shows that, thanks to features like named content retrieval, innate multicast support, and in-network data caching, information-centric networking is positioned to meet the challenging demands of vehicular networks and their evolution. Interoperability with the standard architectures for vehicular applications along with synergies with emerging computing and networking paradigms are debated as future research perspectives.",

   "abstract": "The massive amounts of bandwidth available at millimeter-wave frequencies (above 10 GHz) have the potential to greatly increase the capacity of fifth generation cellular wireless systems. However, to overcome the high isotropic propagation loss experienced at these frequencies, highly directional antennas will be required at both the base station and the mobile terminal to achieve sufficient link budget in wide area networks. This reliance on directionality has important implications for control layer procedures. In particular, initial access can be significantly delayed due to the need for the base station and the user to find the proper alignment for directional transmission and reception. This article provides a survey of several recently proposed techniques for this purpose. A coverage and delay analysis is performed to compare various techniques including exhaustive and iterative search, and context-information-based algorithms. We show that the best strategy depends on the target SNR regime, and provide guidelines to characterize the optimal choice as a function of the system parameters.",

While many works have been devoted to SoTL as a scholarly process, relatively few have considered the institutional or discipline-specific context within which SoTL is practiced. Here, we consider how the principles of SoTL can help inform teaching, learning, and research supervision within the engineering disciplines; recommend best practices for planning, conducting, and presenting SoTL-based research in communications education and training; and reveal how the IEEE Communications Society proposes to help promote SoTL activity in communications education and training.",

   "abstract": "While innovation in inter-domain routing has remained stagnant for over a decade, Internet exchange points (IXPs) are consolidating their role as economically advantageous interconnection points for reducing path latencies and exchanging ever increasing amounts of traffic. As such, IXPs appear as a natural place to foster network innovation and assess the benefits of SDN, a recent technological trend that has already boosted innovation within data center networks. In this article, we give a comprehensive overview of use cases for SDN at IXPs, which leverage the superior vantage point of an IXP to introduce advanced features like load balancing and DDoS mitigation. We discuss the benefits of SDN solutions by analyzing real-world data from one of the largest IXPs. We also leverage insights into IXP operations to shape benefits not only for members but also for operators.",

   "abstract": "SWCM aims to mitigate the adverse effects of interference at the physical layer by tracking the optimal maximum likelihood decoding performance with low-complexity decoding and minimal coordination overhead. This article reviews the basic structure of the SWCM scheme built on the principles of network information theory, and discusses how it can be extended and implemented in practical wireless communication systems. Using a representative implementation based on LTE OFDM MIMO systems, extensive link-level and system-level performance simulations are carried out, which demonstrate that SWCM offers significant gains for all users over conventional interference-aware communication schemes. Network operating prerequisites for SWCM are also discussed to facilitate the standardization effort for its adoption in the fifth generation cellular network.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT), which enables common objects to be intelligent and interactive, is considered the next evolution of the Internet. Its pervasiveness and ability to collect and analyze data that can be converted into information have motivated a plethora of IoT applications. For the successful deployment and management of these applications, cloud computing techniques are indispensable since they provide high computational capabilities as well as large storage capacity. This article aims at providing insights about the architecture, implementation, and performance of the IoT cloud. Several potential application scenarios of IoT cloud are studied, and an architecture is discussed regarding the functionality of each component. Moreover, the implementation details of the IoT cloud are presented along with the services that it offers. The main contributions of this article lie in the combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) servers to offer IoT services in the architecture of the IoT cloud with various techniques to guarantee high performance. Finally, experimental results are given in order to demonstrate the service capabilities of the IoT cloud under certain conditions.",

Consequently, IoT has been an important topic of standardization in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in different Study Groups. ITU-T Study Group 20 was established recently to further promote coordinated progress of global IoT technologies, services, and applications. This article first presents a review of IoT related activities in ITU, and then describes a number of key requirements the IoT infrastructure should satisfy to make it economically and technologically deployable for useful services and applications. It presents several key networking concepts, such as software-defined networking, information-centric networking, and ID-based communication, while highlighting the prospective technologies that are worth further study in ITU.",

   "abstract": "The asynchronous heterogeneous network scenario is becoming one of the key features for 5G mobile communications. Compared to CP-OFDM, which is 4G waveform, superior spectrum confinement as well as higher spectral efficiency has been taken into consideration for 5G waveform design. In this article, we introduce a new waveform called QAM-FBMC that provides superior spectrum confinement and higher spectral efficiency simultaneously against CP-OFDM. The article explains fundamental trade-offs in waveform design and shows how they can be optimized for QAM-FBMC. We also introduce the transmission and reception procedures for QAM-FBMC including its similarities and differences compared to well-known waveforms such as CP-OFDM and OQAM-FBMC. Performance evaluation results show where the spectral efficiency gain of QAM-FBMC over CP-OFDM comes from.",

   "abstract": "In the Industry 4.0 framework based on IoT and smart manufacturing, it is essential to support factory automation and flexibility in harsh or dynamic industrial environments. State-of-the-art technology suggests building a controlled workspace using large-scale deployment of wireless sensors. To overcome the technological challenges in scalability and heterogeneity for large-scale industrial deployment, group-based industrial wireless sensor networks (GIWSNs) are suggested, in which wireless sensors are divided into multiple groups for multiple monitoring tasks, and each group of sensors is deployed densely within a subarea in a large plant or along a long production/assembly line, while connectivity between groups is required. As wireless sensors are equipped with batteries with limited power, it has been challenging to plan sleep schedules of sensors, which are influenced significantly by deployment of such a large-scale GIWSN. However, most previous works on wireless sensor networks independently investigated deployment and sleep scheduling problems, both of which have been shown to be NP-hard. Therefore, this work jointly considers deployment and sleep scheduling of sensors in a GIWSN along a production line. Via the theory of symmetries, we alleviate the computational concerns from multiple groups to one group and another medium-size group. Then we propose a hybrid harmony search and genetic algorithm, which incorporates deployment and sleep schedules to reduce energy consumption. Simulations verify this joint methodology to effectively achieve energy efficiency.",

   "abstract": "We present a novel framework to optimize the lifetime of telecommunication networks exploiting sleep mode (SM) strategy as an outcome of the LIFETEL project. We first consider the main effects impacting the device lifetime, showing that the transitions between active mode (AM) and SM may drastically reduce the device lifetime. We then propose a methodology to limit the impact on the device lifetime when SM states are exploited. Additionally, we report the main outcomes obtained from cellular and backbone scenarios. Results show that a lifetime-aware approach is of fundamental importance for limiting the impact of failures on network devices, while at the same time allowing adequate energy saving. Finally, we discuss the main challenges that still need to be faced for full adoption of lifetime-aware strategies in an operator network.",

Flexible use of the UHF band aims to increase the efficiency of spectrum use in delivering fast-growing and converging mobile broadband, media, and TV content to meet changing consumer needs. Enabling technical factors are presented, and potential services are compared in order to identify similarities and differences in possible business model designs and scaling factors for developing successfully deployable services and regulatory concepts. The results indicate that several services meet basic requirements to scale, leveraging key existing assets and capabilities of LTE technologies and the business ecosystem while extending current business models beyond connectivity. Regulation and standardization forums can utilize the developed use case and service scenarios in analyzing the future of UHF spectrum and LTE broadcasting evolution. Furthermore, the flexible use concept has the potential to transform the business ecosystem around both BC and MBB by introducing new convergence opportunities for LTE's development toward 5G.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communication has become a key technology for competitiveness of next generation vehicles. Recently, the 3GPP has initiated standardization activities for LTE-based V2X services composed of vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle- to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-infrastructure/network. The goal of these 3GPP activities is to enhance LTE systems to enable vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure in order to exchange messages for aiding in road safety, controlling traffic flow, and providing various traffic notifications. In this article, we provide an overview of the service flow and requirements of the V2X services LTE systems are targeting. This article also discusses the scenarios suitable for operating LTE-based V2X services, and addresses the main challenges of high mobility and densely populated vehicle environments in designing technical solutions to fulfill the requirements of V2X services. Leveraging the spectral-efficient air interface, the cost-effective network deployment, and the versatile nature of supporting different communication types, LTE systems along with proper enhancements can be the key enabler of V2X services.",

   "abstract": "The popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles has exploded over the last few years, urgently demanding solutions to transfer large amounts of data from the UAV to the ground. Conversely, a control channel to the UAV is desired, in order to safely operate these vehicles remotely. This article analyzes the use of LTE for realizing this downlink data and uplink control. By means of measurements and simulations, we study the impact of interference and path loss when transmitting data to and from the UAV. Two scenarios are considered in which UAVs act as either base stations transmitting in downlink or UEs transmitting in uplink, and their impact on the respective downlink and uplink performance of an LTE ground network is analyzed. Both measurements and simulations are used to quantify such impact for a range of scenarios with varying altitude, distance from the base station, or UAV density. The measurement sets show that signal-to-interference ratio decreases up to 7 dB for UAVs at 150 m compared to ground users. Simulation results show that a UAV density of 10/km2 gives an average degradation of the signal-to-interference ratio of more than 6 dB. It is concluded that interference is going to be a major limiting factor when LTE enabled UAVs are introduced, and that strong technical solutions will have to be found.",

Unfortunately, like any wireless technology, disruption of these networks is possible through radio jamming. This article investigates the extent to which LTE is vulnerable to RF jamming, spoofing, and sniffing, and assesses different physical layer threats that could affect next-generation critical communication networks. In addition, we examine how sniffing the LTE broadcast messages can aid an adversary in an attack. The weakest links of LTE are identified and used to establish an overall threat assessment.

   "abstract": "Browsing the web has become a common task performed using personal mobile devices, resulting in significant access network and battery limitation challenges. Efforts to alleviate these challenges are commonly based around approaches incorporating elements of on-device and network optimizations. Energy-efficient mobile web content delivery has, in turn, attracted a significant body of research and practical developments. However, the efforts put forth today might not result in long-term applicable results should the underlying characteristics of the mobile content change drastically over time. As caching frequently used data locally is a common initial approach employed to limit network traffic and energy expenditures while \u201con the go,\u201d we evaluate the long-term suitability of approximating a basic set of parameters for a cache and request behavior model using a popular large data set. We present a convenient approach that can employ a general approximation of parameters over time. Our long-term modeling of the underlying factors results in an acceptable level of peak inaccuracies in simulations for more than a year's time horizon. In turn, practitioners and researchers are enabled to readily employ modeling and simulation approaches over a significant period of time with only slight impacts on their approaches and results.",

   "abstract": "The confluence of two recent technological trends - the maturation of ROADM technology and the rise of SDN - has produced the perfect opportunity to streamline carrier metro network operations through the use of automation. This article introduces readers to the carrier metro network and describes the challenges of automating carrier metro network operations. To this end, we illustrate both the inherent complexity of today's metro network and the legacy processes that have been put in place to manage this complexity. Our discussion covers the essential details regarding current practices in metro network operation, and touches on the economic and technical factors that have contributed to these processes remaining in place for so long. We explain how the application of lean methodology can streamline and automate metro network processes - enabling carriers to reduce work in progress, thereby simultaneously decreasing both operational expenditures and time to market.",

   "abstract": "LAA is a new operation mode of LTE in the unlicensed spectrum, which will be featured in LTE Release 13. Under LAA, licensed carriers will be aggregated with unlicensed carriers in order to opportunistically enhance downlink user throughput while still offering seamless mobility support. In order to coexist with WiFi, some of the new functionalities required of LAA LTE include a mechanism for channel sensing based on listen-before-talk, discontinuous transmission on a carrier with limited maximum transmission duration, and multicarrier transmission across multiple unlicensed channels. This article presents a detailed overview of the design agreements for LAA, the impact of unlicensed spectrum operation on the LTE physical layer architecture, and the scope of additional enhancements beyond LTE Release 13. A range of simulations for indoor and multicarrier scenarios show that fair coexistence between LAA and WiFi can be achieved, and that deployment of LAA can provide a boost in WiFi performance.",

   "abstract": "This article describes promising recent progress in the area of massive antenna array architectures with low front-end hardware complexity. The presented technology enables the design and implementation of antenna arrays with large numbers of elements, while obtaining significant front-end hardware savings as compared to the conventional solutions. This newly appearing design approach could be used in order to design either massive arrays with complexity that would be prohibitive with the current technology, or smaller arrays that offer high spatial degrees of freedom and are suitable for future small yet powerful cell nodes. RF hardware architectures with a single RF chain are reviewed, compared, and found superior to conventional MIMO implementations in terms of cost, dissipated heat, and physical size. The proposed improvements on the RF side allow the merging of the two dominant cellular technologies of virtual (distributed) and massive (centralized) MIMO into a hybrid approach of antenna arrays that is suitable for both large base stations and small (possibly cooperative) units such as remote radio heads.",

Specifically, we discuss procedures of deploying LTE-R by describing our construction of a testbed in a commercial railway through cell planning and optimization. Then we demonstrate the performance enabled by the implementation of a testbed for LTE-R. We confirm that not only reliable communications but also multimedia services requiring high data rates are feasible, which gives us some guarantee of the prosperity of various advanced train services. We also discuss a number of valuable technical communication issues related to inherent characteristics of railway communications that are unlike those of commercial wireless communications.",

   "abstract": "CWDM networks have proven to be a promising first-step metro and access network architecture, offering a significant cost advantage over DWDM due to the lower cost of lasers and the filters used in CWDM modules. If demand grows beyond the capacity covered by CWDM channels, DWDM network elements can be introduced to merge CWDM and DWDM traffic at the optical layer. This ensures two advantages: reduced initial investment and scalability for deploying DWDM channels in the future. This article presents various ROADM architectures, and explores the novel optical node architecture of hybrid C/DWDM networks, consisting of CWDM, hybrid C/DWDM, and junction nodes connecting two rings. Evaluation has shown that the hybrid ROADM architecture is superior to other conventional ROADM architectures in terms of scalability and the initial cost of optical nodes and networks.",

   "abstract": "Power systems are undergoing massive operational and technological changes amid increasing demand for environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. The traditional supply-driven approach, relying on large-scale generation plants, which dominated old utilities is reconsidered to incorporate the increased penetration of variable renewable energy sources, and distributed generation and storage. Demand response is an important instrument for improving energy efficiency, since it increases consumers' engagement and provides a mechanism to reduce or shift consumption, resulting in energy savings. Regulators and policy makers in several European countries are taking substantial measures to encourage market uptake of demand response as a means to mitigate the limitations of the existing grid and boost the transition to a low carbon economy. This goes hand in hand with the deployment of services by stakeholders who aggregate consumption flexibility and offer it to grid operators or to the electricity market. Several large-scale pilot projects explore the feasibility of demand response in residential and small commercial customers. This article provides an overview of the current regulatory and policy framework in Europe, and summarizes the state of play of commercial and pilot demand response deployments in various European countries. Also, it highlights some key research objectives associated with demand response.",

   "abstract": "NFV continues to draw immense attention from researchers in both industry and academia. By decoupling NFs from the physical equipment on which they run, NFV promises to reduce CAPEX and OPEX, make networks more scalable and flexible, and lead to increased service agility. However, despite the unprecedented interest it has gained, there are still obstacles that must be overcome before NFV can advance to reality in industrial deployments, let alone delivering on the anticipated gains. While doing so, important challenges associated with network and function MANO need to be addressed. In this article, we introduce NFV and give an overview of the MANO framework that has been proposed by ETSI. We then present representative projects and vendor products that focus on MANO, and discuss their features and relationship with the framework. Finally, we identify open MANO challenges as well as opportunities for future research.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communications is one of the most successful technologies in modern years, given that an exponential growth rate in wireless traffic has been sustained for over a century (known as Cooper\u2019s law). This trend will certainly continue, driven by new innovative applications; for example, augmented reality and the Internet of Things. Massive MIMO has been identified as a key technology to handle orders of magnitude more data traffic. Despite the attention it is receiving from the communication community, we have personally witnessed that Massive MIMO is subject to several widespread misunderstandings, as epitomized by following (fictional) abstract: \u201cThe Massive MIMO technology uses a nearly infinite number of high-quality antennas at the base stations. By having at least an order of magnitude more antennas than active terminals, one can exploit asymptotic behaviors that some special kinds of wireless channels have. This technology looks great at first sight, but unfortunately the signal processing complexity is off the charts and the antenna arrays would be so huge that it can only be implemented in millimeter-wave bands.\u201d These statements are, in fact, completely false. In this overview article, we identify 10 myths and explain why they are not true. We also ask a question that is critical for the practical adoption of the technology and which will require intense future research activities to answer properly. We provide references to key technical papers that support our claims, while a further list of related overview and technical papers can be found at the Massive MIMO Info Point: http://massivemimo. eu",

   "abstract": "3GPP began standardization of carrier aggregation (CA) in LTE-A Rel. 10 to combine up to five component carriers (CCs) for facilitating wider transmission bandwidth of 100 MHz. Further enhancements followed in Rel. 11 and Rel. 12 to enable features such as aggregation of carriers between time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) frame structures. In LTE-A Pro Rel. 13, massive CA enhancements were defined to combine more than five CCs with the initial focus on the downlink. While the benefits of CA have been evident, operating an even larger number of downlink carriers results in increased overhead on the uplink as there is a need to send the combined control information for all the CCs. In this article we give an overview of the standardized enhancements, their impact on uplink control information overhead and its transmission, new control channel formats and their link level investigation in 3GPP-defined simulation assumptions.",

   "abstract": "MTC are expected to play an essential role within future 5G systems. In the FP7 project METIS, MTC has been further classified into mMTC and uMTC. While mMTC is about wireless connectivity to tens of billions of machinetype terminals, uMTC is about availability, low latency, and high reliability. The main challenge in mMTC is scalable and efficient connectivity for a massive number of devices sending very short packets, which is not done adequately in cellular systems designed for human-type communications. Furthermore, mMTC solutions need to enable wide area coverage and deep indoor penetration while having low cost and being energy-efficient. In this article, we introduce the PHY and MAC layer solutions developed within METIS to address this challenge.",

   "abstract": "Much of the previous research on cognitive radio has focused on developing algorithms based on artificial neural networks, the genetic algorithm, and reinforcement learning, each with its pros and cons. In this research, we present a new approach based on metacognition. We believe that the metacognitive framework can be the foundation for the next generation of CRs and further the performance improvements in CR. In this work, we present the elements involved in metacognitive radio, discuss the challenges in their development, present solutions to the challenges along with a possible meta-CR architecture, and show results from our implementation. Each cognitive engine (CE) algorithm has strengths and limitations that make it more suitable for certain operating scenarios (channel conditions, operating objective, available hardware, etc.) than other algorithms. A meta-CE can adapt faster and improve performance by exploiting the characteristics and expected performance of the individual CE algorithms. It understands the operational scenarios and utilizes the most appropriate algorithm for the current operational scenario by switching between the algorithms or adjusting them as necessary.",

   "abstract": "As driving becomes more automated, vehicles are being equipped with more sensors generating even higher data rates. Radars are used for object detection, visual cameras as virtual mirrors, and LIDARs for generating high resolution depth associated range maps, all to enhance the safety and efficiency of driving. Connected vehicles can use wireless communication to exchange sensor data, allowing them to enlarge their sensing range and improve automated driving functions. Unfortunately, conventional technologies, such as DSRC and 4G cellular communication, do not support the gigabit-per-second data rates that would be required for raw sensor data exchange between vehicles. This article makes the case that mmWave communication is the only viable approach for high bandwidth connected vehicles. The motivations and challenges associated with using mmWave for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure applications are highlighted. A high-level solution to one key challenge - the overhead of mmWave beam training - is proposed. The critical feature of this solution is to leverage information derived from the sensors or DSRC as side information for the mmWave communication link configuration. Examples and simulation results show that the beam alignment overhead can be reduced by using position information obtained from DSRC.",

   "abstract": "As wireless communication evolves toward 5G, both fixed broadband and mobile broadband will play a crucial part in providing the gigabit-per-second infrastructure for a connected society. This article proposes an MGB system as the solution to two critical problems in this evolution: last-mile access for fixed broadband and small cell backhaul for mobile broadband. The key idea is to use spectrum that is already available in the millimeter-wave bands for fixed wireless access with optimized dynamic beamforming and massive MIMO infrastructure to achieve high capacity with wide area coverage. This article explains the MGB concept and describes potential array architectures for realizing the system. Simulations demonstrate that with 500 MHz of bandwidth (at 39 GHz band) and 28 dBm transmission power (55 dBm EIRP), it is possible to provide more than 11 Gb/s backhaul capacity for 96 small cells within a 1 km radius.",

   "abstract": "The need for continuous safety improvements and increased operational efficiency is driving the mining industry through a transition toward automated operations. From a communications perspective, this transition introduces a new set of high-bandwidth business-critical and mission- critical applications that need to be met by the wireless network. This article introduces fundamental concepts behind open-pit mining and discusses why this ever-changing environment and strict industrial reliability requirements pose unique challenges to traditional broadband network planning and optimization techniques. On the other hand, unlike unpredictable disaster scenarios, mining is a carefully planned activity. Taking advantage of this predictability element, we propose a framework that integrates mine and radio network planning so that continuous and automated adaptation of the radio network becomes possible. The potential benefits of this framework are evaluated by means of an illustrative example.",

Built on top of the participatory sensing vision, MCSC has two characteristic features: it leverages heterogeneous crowdsourced data from two data sources: participatory sensing and participatory social media; and it presents the fusion of human and machine intelligence in both the sensing and computing processes. This article characterizes the unique features and challenges of MCSC. We further present early efforts on MCSC to demonstrate the benefits of aggregating heterogeneous crowdsourced data.",

This article discusses 3GPP EPS mobile network evolution as a whole, analyzing specific architecture properties that are critical in future 3GPP EPS releases. In particular, this article discusses the evolution toward a \"network of functions,\" network slicing, and software-defined mobile network control, management, and orchestration. Furthermore, the roadmap for the future evolution of 3GPP EPS and its technology components is detailed and relevant standards defining organizations are listed.",

   "abstract": "As mobile services are shifting from connection- centric communications to content-centric communications, content-centric wireless networking emerges as a promising paradigm to evolve the current network architecture. Caching popular content at the wireless edge, including base stations and user terminals, provides an effective approach to alleviate the heavy burden on backhaul links, as well as lower delays and deployment costs. In contrast to wired networks, a unique characteristic of content-centric wireless networks (CCWNs) is the mobility of mobile users. While it has rarely been considered by existing works on caching design, user mobility contains various helpful side information that can be exploited to improve caching efficiency at both BSs and user terminals. In this article, we present a general framework for mobility-aware caching in CCWNs. Key properties of user mobility patterns that are useful for content caching are first identified, and then different design methodologies for mobility-aware caching are proposed. Moreover, two design examples are provided to illustrate the proposed framework in detail, and interesting future research directions are identified.",

   "abstract": "In light of the rapid growth in mobile video traffic and demand for stable video viewing with higher video resolution, we introduce a novel transport protocol for content-centric networking (CCN), named Content Name-Based Mobile Real-Time Streaming (NMRTS). NMRTS utilizes \"symbolic interest\" for mobile users to receive real-time streaming without sending bursty requests, and the regular interests (which CCN generally uses) to recover lost packets during handover. NMRTS can support seamless handover by adjusting the symbolic interest lifetime and its transmission frequency according to network conditions. Through simulations, we demonstrate that NMRTS reduces the amount of both control message transmission and redundant data traffic, and minimizes data reception delay, compared with the general CCN.",

We first review in this article the different network technologies and architectures used by both industries. We then present and compare the two prevailing mathematical frameworks used by each industry for validating the correct behavior of a network: schedulability analysis and network calculus. Via an empirical evaluation of both methods in two different use cases, we show the strengths and weaknesses of both methods, and derive a simple guideline on which method to use depending on the type of network used.",

   "abstract": "5G wireless technology is paving the way to revolutionize future ubiquitous and pervasive networking, wireless applications, and user quality of experience. To realize its potential, 5G must provide considerably higher network capacity, enable massive device connectivity with reduced latency and cost, and achieve considerable energy savings compared to existing wireless technologies. The main objective of this article is to explore the potential of NFV in enhancing 5G radio access networks' functional, architectural, and commercial viability, including increased automation, operational agility, and reduced capital expenditure. The ETSI NFV Industry Specification Group has recently published drafts focused on standardization and implementation of NFV. Harnessing the potential of 5G and network functions virtualization, we discuss how NFV can address critical 5G design challenges through service abstraction and virtualized computing, storage, and network resources. We describe NFV implementation with network overlay and SDN technologies. In our discussion, we cover the first steps in understanding the role of NFV in implementing CoMP, D2D communication, and ultra densified networks.",

   "abstract": "With the blossoming of network functions virtualization and software-defined networks, networks are becoming more and more agile with features like resilience, programmability, and open interfaces, which help operators to launch a network or service with more flexibility and shorter time to market. Recently, the concept of network slicing has been proposed to facilitate the building of a dedicated and customized logical network with virtualized resources. In this article, we introduce the concept of hierarchical NSaaS, helping operators to offer customized end-to-end cellular networks as a service. Moreover, the service orchestration and service level agreement mapping for quality assurance are introduced to illustrate the architecture of service management across different levels of service models. Finally, we illustrate the process of network slicing as a service within operators by typical examples. With network slicing as a service, we believe that the supporting system will transform itself to a production system by merging the operation and business domains, and enabling operators to build network slices for vertical industries more agilely.",

   "abstract": "It is expected that by the year 2020, video services will account for more than 70 percent of mobile traffic. It is worth noting that broadcasting is a mechanism that efficiently delivers the same content to many users, not only focusing on venue casting, but also distributing many other media such as software updates and breaking news. Although broadcasting services are available in LTE and LTE-A networks, new improvements are needed in some areas to handle the demands expected in the near future. In this article we review the actual situation and some of the techniques that will make the broadcast service more dynamic and scalable, meeting the demands of its evolution toward the next generation. Resource allocation techniques for broadcast/multicast services, integration with new waveforms in 5th generation mobile communications (5G), initiatives for spectrum sharing and aggregation, or the deployment of small cells placed together with the existing macro cells, are some enhancements that are examined in detail, providing directions for further development. With this evolution, 5G broadcasting will be a driver to achieve the spectral efficiency needed for the 1000 times traffic growth that is expected in upcoming years, leading to new applications in 5G networks that are specifically focused on mobile video services.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communications play a critical role in national security and disaster relief and are extensively utilized by first responder teams, such as police officers, firefighters, and ambulances. The first responders in emergency situations need to always be connected with one another and with the remote service centers for effective cooperation and coordination. However, the existing public safety (PS) services fail to satisfy the PS user requirements in many emergency scenarios, which usually leads to exceptionally high traffic loads. As a result, increasing the network capacity is one of the primary concerns, and spectrum sharing has been deemed the key solution. With appropriate spectrum sharing partnerships among PS agencies and commercial networks, PS users can access licensed PS spectrum, shared spectrum, as well as commercial networks when the need arises. In this article we present different initiatives undertaken by Wireless @ Virginia Tech toward the next generation PS network. We also discuss our vision of a flexible, rapidly deployable, and reconfigurable PS system to meet imminent and future demands on critical communications infrastructure and discuss the value of spectrum sharing for supporting this long-term vision.",

   "abstract": "Non-orthogonal transmission, although not entirely new to the wireless industry, is gaining more attention due to its promised throughput gain and unique capability to support a large number of simultaneous transmissions within limited resources. In this article, several key techniques for non-orthogonal transmission are discussed. The downlink technique is featured by MUST, which is being specified in 3GPP for mobile broadband services. In the uplink, grantfree schemes such as multi-user shared access and sparse code multiple access, are promising in supporting massive machine-type communication services. The multi-antenna aspect is also addressed in the context of MUST, showing that MIMO technology and non-orthogonal transmission can be used jointly to provide combined gain.",

   "abstract": "The concepts of wisdom of crowd and collective intelligence have been utilized by mobile application developers to achieve large-scale distributed computation, known as crowd computing. The profitability of this method heavily depends on users' social interactions and their willingness to share resources. Thus, different crowd computing applications need to adopt mechanisms that motivate peers to collaborate and defray the costs of participating ones who share their resources. In this article, we propose OPENRP, a novel, lightweight, and scalable system middleware that provides a unified interface to crowd computing and opportunistic networking applications. When an application wants to perform a device-to-device task, it delegates the task to the middleware, which takes care of choosing the best peers with whom to collaborate and sending the task to these peers. OPENRP evaluates and updates the reputation of participating peers based on their mutual opportunistic interactions. To show the benefits of the middleware, we simulated the behavior of two representative crowdsourcing applications: message forwarding and task offloading. Through extensive simulations on real human mobility traces, we show that the traffic generated by the applications is lower compared to two benchmark strategies. As a consequence, we show that when using our middleware, the energy consumed by the nodes is reduced. Finally, we show that when dividing the nodes into selfish and altruistic, the reputation scores of the altruistic peers increase with time, while those of the selfish ones decrease.",

   "abstract": "A large fraction of smartphones have both cellular and WiFi interfaces. Despite this, smartphones rarely use them simultaneously because most of their data traffic is controlled by TCP, which can only use one interface at a time. Multipath TCP is a recently standardized TCP extension that solves this problem. Smartphone vendors have started to deploy Multipath TCP, but its performance with real smartphone applications has not been studied in detail yet. To fill this gap, we port Multipath TCP on Android smartphones, and propose a framework to analyze the interactions between real network-heavy applications and this new protocol. We use eight popular Android applications and analyze their usage of the WiFi and cellular networks (especially 4G/LTE).",

However, these networks are energy-constrained and, more problematically, energy-hungry, as a consequence of the use of underwater acoustic links. In this work, we thoroughly review potential techniques for greening underwater sensor networks. In a top-down approach, we discuss the principal design and challenges of the appealing highlighted techniques. We also exemplify their use by surveying recent proposals in underwater sensor networks. Finally, we describe potential future research directions for energy conservation in underwater networks.",

   "abstract": "Characterization of communication links in aerial wireless sensor networks (AWSNs) is of paramount importance for achieving acceptable network performance. Protocols based on an inaccurate communication model may exhibit inconsistent behavior due to link degradation not considered during the design stage. It is thus necessary to account for factors that affect link performance in real deployments. This article details observations from experimental research in the existing literature to characterize the behavior of communication links in AWSNs. The contributions of this article are two-fold. First, we consider research carried out on low-power low-data rate Zigbee-compliant radios and observe common denominator characteristics such as environmental factors, antenna orientation, and the multi-path fading effect due to ground reflections as major contributors to link degradation in AWSNs. We analyze these common denominator characteristics and perform an experimental assessment of their relative importance. Second, based on these observations, we recommend measures that can help alleviate the effect of these potential sources of performance degradation in AWSNs in order to achieve significantly improved network performance.",

   "abstract": "In software-defined networks, packet forwarding is performed by installing rules on the switches' flow tables. After the rules are installed, the controller needs to dynamically update the rules during runtime for a variety of reasons including traffic engineering, policy changes, network maintenance, and so on. A single forwarding policy update often consists of rule modifications on multiple switches simultaneously. Since the update process requires moving flows to different paths in a consistent and correct manner, multiple steps are usually involved. Thus, additional resources are needed to handle the flow update to ensure correctness and performance, such as extra bandwidth and flow table entries. In this work, we analyze different existing mechanisms of flow update from their resource utilization perspectives. Specifically, we study the impact of bandwidth and flow table size on the performance of flow update, and their interactions. We provide both qualitative analysis of the tradeoff between these two kinds of resources, and the quantitative simulation results of this trade-off under different realistic network topologies. Our observation is important to the problems related to flow update, based on which we further illustrate its usefulness with three applications.",

   "abstract": "As an environment-friendly substitute for conventional fuel-powered vehicles, EVs and their components have been widely developed and deployed worldwide. The large-scale integration of EVs into power grid brings both challenges and opportunities to the system performance. On one hand, the load demand from EV charging imposes a heavey impact on the stability and efficiency of power grid. On the other hand, EVs could potentially act as mobile energy storage systems to improve the power network performance, such as load flattening, fast frequency control, and facilitating renewable energy integration. Evidently, uncontrolled EV charging could lead to inefficient power network operation or even security issues. This has spurred on enormous research interest in designing charging coordination mechanisms. A key design challenge here lies in the lack of complete knowledge of events that occur in the future. Indeed, the amount of knowledge of future events significantly impacts the design of efficient charging control algorithms. This article focuses on introducing online EV charging scheduling techniques that deal with different degrees of uncertainty and randomness of future knowledge. In addition, we highlight the promising future research directions for EV charging control.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we propose a PHY-caching scheme for 5G wireless networks to achieve spectral efficiency gain over conventional caching schemes, which do not induce physical layer cooperation. By properly caching some popular contents at the BSs, the proposed PHY-caching can opportunistically transform the topology of the RAN from an unfavorable topology (e.g., relay or interference topology) into a more favorable MIMO broadcast topology and enjoy spectral efficiency gain. Specifically, we first introduce a generic cache model and cache-assisted PHY transmission, and show that PHY-caching can significantly enhance the spectral efficiency of the wireless network by inducing dynamic side information at the BSs. Then we discuss the design challenges and solutions of PHY-caching. We introduce maximum-distance-separable-coded caching and online cache content placement design as a potential solution. As a case study, we analyze the performance trade-off between PHY-caching at the BS and CN-caching at the gateway under capacity-limited CN-fronthaul. We show that even though PHY-caching covers fewer users than CN-caching and results in a lower cache hit rate, it is still efficient to do PHY-caching at the BS.",

   "abstract": "In an ideal world, the standards promulgated by standards-development organizations (SDOs), such as the IEEE, ITU, and ETSI, would always result from an impartial comparison of proposed solutions made in an environment \"free of distortion, bias, or manipulation by private interests.\" In the real world, however, standards tend to be a result of compromises and, in some cases, hardfought battles among parties, often competitors, who have diverse private interests. Considerations beyond technical merit are generally in play. For better or worse, one of those considerations is often the understanding that intellectual property may protect a candidate solution. Of the four types of intellectual property - patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets - the one that looms largest in the standards-development context is patents. This article provides a foundational overview of patents and patent systems with a specific focus on the patent laws and procedures of the United States. Where feasible, the article also identifies similarities and differences in the patent laws and procedures of other countries.",

   "abstract": "The extremely pervasive nature of mobile technologies, together with the user's need to continuously interact with her personal devices and to be always connected, strengthen the user-centric approach to design and develop new communication and computing solutions. Nowadays users not only represent the final utilizers of the technology, but they actively contribute to its evolution by assuming different roles: they act as humans, by sharing contents and experiences through social networks, and as virtual sensors, by moving freely in the environment with their sensing devices. Smart cities represent an important reference scenario for the active participation of users through mobile technologies. It involves multiple application domains and defines different levels of user engagement. Participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing, and mobile social networks (MSNs) currently represent some of the most promising people-centric paradigms. In addition, their integration can further improve the user involvement through new services and applications. In this article we present SmartCitizen app, an MSN application designed in the framework of a smart city project to stimulate the active participation of citizens in generating and sharing useful contents related to the quality of life in their city. The app has been developed on top of a context- and social-aware middleware platform (CAMEO) able to integrate the main features of people-centric computing paradigms, lightening the app developer's effort. Existing middleware platforms generally focus on a single people-centric paradigm, exporting a limited set of features to mobile applications. CAMEO overcomes these limitations and, through Smart- Citizen, we highlight the advantages of implementing this type of mobile application in a smart city scenario. Experimental results shown in this article can also represent the technical guidelines for the development of heterogeneous people-centric mobile applications embracing different application domains.",

   "abstract": "Verification of theoretical analysis is a vital step in the development of an application or a protocol for wireless networks. Most proposals are evaluated through mathematical analysis followed by either simulation or experimental validation campaigns. In this article, we analyze a large set of statistics in articles published (674 papers in total) in the top representative ad hoc and wireless sensor networks related conferences (i.e., ACM/ IEEE IPSN, ACM MobiCom, ACM MobiHoc, and ACM SenSys) during the period 2008-2013. We focus on the evaluation methodologies provided by researchers. More specifically, our goal is to explore the role of simulators and testbeds in the theoretical analysis of a model throughout the protocol development procedure. We show that there is a tendency for more and more researchers to rely on custom or open testbeds in order to evaluate the performance of their proposals. Simulators indeed fail to reproduce actual environmental conditions of deployed systems. Experimentation with real hardware allows our research community to mind the gaps between simulation and real deployment. Still, as the experimental apFproach through custom testbeds results in a low reproducibility level (i.e., 16.5 percent), we investigate to what extent such performance evaluation methods will be able to bridge those gaps. We finally discuss experimental testbeds and their potential to replace simulators as the cornerstone of performance evaluation procedures.",

   "abstract": "Next-generation public safety communications (PSC) systems must sustain high-speed, ultra reliable wireless data transmissions. Moving toward this next generation of PSCs warrants a new perspective of increased heterogeneity in emerging wireless architectures and increased multiplexing of wireless spectrum. To realize this vision, models that incentivize users to opportunistically share their spectrum as substrates over possibly multiple hops, and decentralized and open techniques that seamlessly exploit these substrates for public safety applications are much needed. The value of such multihop and multi-technology pervasive spectrum sharing (PSS) is more pronounced for application scenarios in which the need for spectrum access is vital, and infrastructure-less operation is necessary. This article introduces PSS as a new architecture where sharing is the norm, and outlines its vision, principles, and technical challenges.",

   "abstract": "IA is a promising solution for the interference management of future wireless networks. On the other hand, physical layer security is a critical issue of wireless communications in the presence of adversaries. Recently, these two important fields tend to be researched closely together. In this article, some of the key results are summarized, and two primary attacks at the physical layer of IA-based networks, adversarial jamming and eavesdropping, are further studied. We first propose an anti-jamming scheme by aligning the jamming signal together with interference among users cooperatively when an adversarial jammer exists. Then an AN scheme is proposed, in which the external eavesdropping is disrupted by AN without introducing any additional interference to the legitimate network. To further analyze the potential threat, a collusive eavesdropping scheme by some hostile IA users in the network is also proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of these schemes. Finally, some future challenges are also summarized.",

   "abstract": "While the open nature of radio propagation enables convenient \u201canywhere\u201d wireless access, it becomes the root of security vulnerabilities in wireless communications. In light of this, physical-layer authentication, which is based on exploitation of the dynamics of physical layer attributes, is emerging as an effective approach to enhancing wireless security. In this article, we first review the existing physical-layer authentication techniques and identify their current limitations, ranging from low authentication reliability to the difficulties of integrating these techniques with the existing wireless infrastructure and applying them in complex future networks. We then present three promising research areas in addressing these challenges. Specifically, we propose the use of the multi-attribute multi-observation technique for enhancing the authentication reliability. In order to apply pointto- point physical-layer authentication techniques into existing wireless networks, we propose a cross-layer authentication approach relying on a composite security key that can seamlessly integrate physical-layer and upper-layer authentication schemes. We also discuss possible ways of invoking physical-layer authentication to reduce both the complexity and latency of the security processes in complex heterogeneous networks with the aid of the proposed physical security context sharing.",

   "abstract": "We are witnessing the evolution of optical networks toward highly heterogeneous, flexible networks with a widening area of application. As the bandwidth and reliability performance requirements of mission-critical applications tighten, and the amount of carried data grows, issues related to optical network security are becoming increasingly important. Optical networks are vulnerable to several types of attacks at the physical layer, typically aimed at disrupting the service or gaining unauthorized access to carried data. Such security breaches can induce financial losses to clients or loss of privacy, or cause network-wide service disruption, possibly leading to huge data and revenue losses. Awareness of system weaknesses and possible attack methods is a prerequisite for designing effective network security solutions. As optical networks evolve, new and changing vulnerabilities must be identified and dealt with efficiently. To this end, this article provides a comprehensive overview of potential physical-layer attack scenarios in current and future optical networks. It then proposes a general security framework, outlining possible strategies for dealing with such attacks, meant to aid in the development of efficient provisioning, monitoring, protection, and restoration schemes in the context of optical-layer security.",

   "abstract": "Service providers spend billions upgrading their broadband access networks to the latest access standards. Fiber has become the technology of choice in the medium and long term, thanks to its speed, reach, and future-proofness. A differential advantage of fiber over other broadband access technologies is that it makes it possible for operators to deliver symmetric-rate services. Most of today's commercial offers based on regular PON range from 10 to 100 Mb/s of committed information rate, and higher rates are advertised as peak rates with unspecified guarantees. In this article we focus on delivering symmetrical 1 Gb/s access to residential users with a target temporal guarantee at the least cost using next-generation PON technologies. We compare four NG-PON standard access technologies, GPON, XGPON, WDM-PON, and the emerging TWDM-PON, from technical and economic perspectives. The study shows that if a service provider wants to keep up with the growing user traffic pattern in the long run, only TWDM-PON can provide 1 Gb/s nearly guaranteed at a moderate cost with respect to the fully dedicated 1 Gb/s point-to-point connection available in WDM-PON technologies.",

   "abstract": "Nowadays, efficient communication technologies are of paramount importance to provide effective and reliable emergency management systems. New wireless communications engineering approaches and value-added services could lead to great benefits, improving situational awareness and enhancing life-saving capabilities. For these reasons, governments and organizations involved in public safety and security (PSS) are devoting great interest in the transition from existing narrowband wireless systems toward broadband. For this purpose, a viable solution is to adapt the new LTE-A technology in order to provide IP-based broadband services with security and reliability characteristics typical of PSS networks. However, the migration of these systems to LTE-A is currently a critical issue. Costs, timing, and spectrum availability for the deployment of a PSS-dedicated network are demanding. In addition, providing mission-critical services on an LTE-based PSS system needs a proper network architecture solution in order to achieve and maintain required performance and reliability levels. To fully accomplish this task, research efforts can result in significant improvements and adjustments of future releases of the LTE-A standard. This article focuses on critical issues that impact PSS communications evolution toward new technologies and describes the related possible steps, starting from the exploitation of the already deployed LTE-A commercial networks up to a fully PSS-dedicated network infrastructure. Finally, advanced solutions are described and critically discussed.",

   "abstract": "Due to the broadcast nature of acoustic channel, underwater acoustic networks (UANs) face threats of eavesdropping and fake data injection. How to secure acoustic communications in a UAN is becoming an important but challenging topic. Among different secret key approaches, received-signal-strength (RSS)-based key generation is particularly appealing, as it can eliminate the need to deploy an additional key distribution center, making it a more attractive method than conventional symmetric key cryptography in resource-constrained UANs. A variety of RSSbased key generation approaches have been designed for wireless radio networks. However, no attempt has been made to evaluate their performance in underwater environments. In this article, we provide an overview of the advantages of RSS-based key generation and explore the major challenges from the unique features of underwater systems through experiment results of sea trails. Meanwhile, we discuss viable solutions to improve the performance of RSS-based key generation in oceans.",

A literature survey reveals that none of the state-of-the-art propagation models such as WINNER/IMT-Advanced, COST 2100, and IEEE 802.11 fully satisfies the model requirements without significant extensions, and therefore there is room for a new framework of propagation models. We then present a novel map-based propagation model that satisfies the model requirements, and also introduce new extensions to existing stochastic models. Several open issues are finally identified that require further studies in 5G propagation modeling.",

MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck toward enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate CSIT. This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this article, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages, and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability, and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions. Open problems, the impact on standard specifications, and operational challenges are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "Virtualization is an enabling technology that improves scalability, reliability, and flexibility. Virtualized networking is tackled by emulating or paravirtualizing network interface cards. This approach, however, leads to complexities (implementation and management) and has to conform to some limitations imposed by the Ethernet standard. RINA turns the current approach to virtualized networking on its head: instead of emulating networks to perform inter-process communication on a single processing system, it sees networking as an extension to local inter-process communication. In this article, we show how RINA can leverage a paravirtualization approach to achieve a more manageable solution for virtualized networking. We also present experimental results performed on IRATI, the reference open source implementation of RINA, which shows the potential performance that can be achieved by deploying our solution.",

   "abstract": "SDR has increasingly become an invaluable research, development, and educational tool within the telecommunications sector with respect to rapidly prototyping new algorithms and paradigms in actual radio hardware and evaluating them in real-world over-the-air conditions. Due to advances in microprocessor technology, radio frequency hardware, and software, SDR has matured into a reliable tool that is now part of almost every communication engineer's toolbox, and it has changed the way the telecommunication sector produces innovative solutions to technical challenges. In this article, we explore four case studies that highlight SDR as a reliable tool in industry, academia, and government. Specifically, we study four examples that illustrate: advances in low-cost, reliable, and versatile SDR platforms, open source and universal SDR software development environments, powerful technical computing environments employing SDR hardware for real-world experimentation, and educational paradigms for synthesizing digital communications and digital processing concepts using SDR technology. By understanding the impact of these case studies, we intend to provide some insight on how the SDR revolution has changed the way the world designs and implements telecommunication systems.",

   "abstract": "Mobile devices today are constantly generating and consuming a tremendous amount of content on the Internet. Caching of such \"massive\" data is beyond the capacity of existing cellular networks in terms of both cost and bandwidth due to its connection-centric nature. The increasing demand for content poses fundamental questions like where, what, and how to cache and retrieve cached content. Leveraging the shift toward a content-centric networking paradigm, we propose to cache content close to the mobile user to avoid wasting resources and decrease access delays. Therefore, we present SAVING, a socially aware vehicular information-centric networking system for content storage and sharing over vehicles using their computing, caching, and communication (3Cs) capabilities. The encapsulated 3Cs are exploited first to identify the potential candidates, socially important, to cache in the fleet of vehicles. To achieve this, we propose a novel vehicle ranking system allowing a smart vehicle to autonomously \"compute\" its eligibility to address the question, where to cache. The identified vehicles then collaborate to efficiently \"cache\" content between them based on the content popularity and availability to decide what and how to cache. Finally, to facilitate efficient content distribution, we present a socially aware content distribution protocol allowing vehicles to \"communicate\" to address the question how to retrieve cached content. Implementation results for SAVING on 2986 vehicles with realistic mobility traces suggests it as an efficient and scalable computing, caching, and communication system.",

   "abstract": "LTE self-organizing networks (SONs) automate several management mechanisms related to network planning, configuration, and optimization, which require network programmability at both the control plane and data plane. This requirement is a design target shared by software defined networking (SDN) and software defined radio (SDR) paradigms, which are intended to achieve open programmable and reconfigurable networks. Hence, the convergence of the programmable- control-plane nature of SDN with the programmable-data-plane nature of SDR into an SON-based architecture will complement and enhance their respective scopes. We propose an SON-based management framework that leverages programmable control and data planes, and emphasizes the need for an open and extensible protocol interface that combines the main features of current protocols such as OpenFlow, MIH, and XMPP.",

   "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless networking technologies are leading toward the proliferation of novel home network applications. However, the landscape of emerging scenarios is fragmented due to their varying technological requirements and the heterogeneity of current wireless technologies. We argue that the development of flexible software-defined wireless architectures, including such efforts as the wireless MAC processor, coupled with SDN concepts, will enable the support of both emerging and future home applications. In this article, we first identify problems with managing current home networks composed of separate network segments governed by different technologies. Second, we point out the flaws of current approaches to provide interoperability of these technologies. Third, we present a vision of a software-defined multi-technology network architecture (SDN@home) and demonstrate how a future home gateway (SDN controller) can directly and dynamically program network devices. Finally, we define a new type of flexibility enabled by SDN@home. Wireless protocols and features are no longer tied to specific technologies but can be used by general-purpose wireless SDN devices. This permits satisfaction of the requirements demanded by home owners and service providers under heterogeneous network conditions.",

   "abstract": "Ubiquitous data center optical interconnection is a promising scenario to meet the high burstiness and high-bandwidth requirements of services in terms of the user-access-oriented interconnection between user and data center, inter-data- center, and intra-data-center interconnection. However, in the current mode of operation, the control of the data center and optical network is separately deployed. Enabling even limited interworking among these separated control systems does not provide a mechanism to exchange resource information and enhance the high-level performance requirement of applications. Our previous work implemented cross-stratum optimization of optical network and application strata resources inter-data-center, which allows the accommodation of data center services. In view of this, this study extends to the ubiquitous data center optical interconnection scenario. This article presents a novel SUDOI architecture aimed at extensive user access from the perspective of heterogeneous cross-stratum and multi-layer networking modes. SUDOI can enable cross-stratum optimization of application and optical network stratum resources, and enhance multiple- layer resource integration in the ubiquitous data center optical interconnection. The functional modules of SUDOI architecture, including the core elements of various controllers, are described in detail. The cooperation procedure in user-access-oriented interconnection, multiple- layer resource integration inter-data-center, and intra-data-center service modes is investigated. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture are also experimentally demonstrated on our OaaS testbed with OpenFlow-enabled optical nodes, and compared to the CSO scheme in terms of blocking probability and resource occupation rate. Numerical results are given and analyzed based on the testbed. Some future discussion and exploration issues are presented in the conclusion.",

Up until now, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted by researchers to design WPTNs that maximize several objectives such as harvested power, energy outage, and charging delay. However, inherent security and safety issues are generally overlooked, and these need to be solved if WPTNs are to become widespread.

   "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that community response networks, locally grouping both professional emergency responders and residents by using mobile and social networking technologies, can significantly improve disaster response. In particular, community response networks formed by mobile users/devices communicating by using only heterogeneous wireless ad hoc links, called herein CRHWNs, can exploit context awareness, defined as the capability of providing applications with full awareness of execution context. In fact, the correct and timely distribution of the current situation, such as health state and position of injured people, can substantially improve community coordination, thus increasing the possibility of saving human lives. Unfortunately, real-world context-aware services in disaster area scenarios require efficient, reliable, and scalable context data distribution and retrieval, and these properties clash with the limited resources usually supported by mobile devices and wireless communications. Along that direction, this article presents our context data distribution infrastructure for CRHWNs, which achieves data distribution efficiency and reliability by also exploiting useful quality indicators, such as data retrieval time and trustworthiness. We also show how our solution increases context data distribution/ retrieval scalability by dynamically self-adapting (a limited number of) data distribution paths and optimizing context data pushing to interested consumers. Experimental results validate our main assumptions and demonstrate how our solution introduces a limited runtime overhead.",

Similar to its wired counterpart, SDWN is expected to introduce a wide range of benefits to the operation and management of wireless networks. Security is always important to any network. On one hand, SDWN enables new security mechanisms. On the other hand, some new threats are introduced due to the separation of the control and data planes and the introduction of the logically centralized controller. In this article, we discuss its security threat vectors as well as design issues in making it secure. Also, we analyze the security requirements of SDWN, and then summarize the security attacks and countermeasures in this area and suggest some future research directions.",

   "abstract": "Mobile networks have rapidly evolved in recent years due to the increase in multimedia traffic and offered services. This has led to a growth in the volume of control data and measurements that are used by self-healing systems. To maintain a certain quality of service, self-healing systems must complete their tasks in a reasonable time. The conjunction of a big volume of data and the limitation of time requires a big data approach to the problem of self-healing. This article reviews the data that self-healing uses as input and justifies its classification as big data. Big data techniques applied to mobile networks are examined, and some use cases along with their big data solutions are surveyed.",

   "abstract": "The telecommunications landscape has been undergoing a major shift in recent years. Initially Software Defined Networking (SDN), and then Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have opened up new ways of looking at the increasingly demanding service provider scenario. The description of the service to be provided will be a key point determining the success in the integration and interoperability of the different proposals. However, the refined understanding of the future scenario and its requirements has recently introduced unique challenges in the path to fully achieve the benefits of the NFV vision. In this paper we review the proposals of service description in the main initiatives related to the NFV arena. Then we elaborate on key novel challenges and evaluate how the different proposals solve them. Finally, we propose a straw man model of service and resource description addressing these challenges and defining the features that would serve as design directions for future initiatives and updates in this topic.",

   "abstract": "Predicting network throughput of video sessions using large-scale wide area measurements can enable throughput-aware initial bit rate selection and the best content servers selection. In this article, using a unique dataset from a commercial VoD system, we first dissect the impact of network throughput on user engagement, and show that the improper selection of initial bit rates, due to unavailability of network throughput estimation, leads to a high likelihood of join failure. We then study the throughput prediction problem in Internet video systems and propose a hybrid approach that combines several heuristics. Trace-driven experiments show that the hybrid approach achieves high prediction accuracy and large coverage. The prediction approach can be leveraged for improved video quality and user experience.",

   "abstract": "Due to the high costs of wide area links, traffic engineering is frequently used to optimize wide area networks' performance. In recent years, architectures based on software defined networking approaches are being proposed as better ways of implementing network control and management. However, network optimization requires timely acquisition of statistics on network traffic demands by SDN controllers, as well as timely reconfiguration of network paths. Both goals may only be achieved with a scalable control plane. In this article, we present an approach meant to trade complexity and scalability of the control plane for routing optimality. Our experiments suggest that the performance of provider networks is nearly optimal, even when load balancing parameters have been computed using a slightly outdated vision of traffic demands. We named this approach short-sighted routing (SSR). Our results also show that performance optimality in many provider networks that use load balancing over several paths is not affected in a significant way by relaxing the timeliness of network traffic demands acquisition and the corresponding load balancing reconfiguration. This has allowed us to conclude that dynamic centralized network optimization and management, in accordance with an SDN approach, is also quite realistic in service provider networks.",

In order to improve the energy efficiency of information transfer between small devices, we review state-of-the-art research in simultaneous wireless energy and information transfer, especially for relay-based IoT systems. In particular, we analyze simultaneous information and energy transfer from the source node, and the design of time-switching and power-splitting operation modes, as well as the associated optimization algorithms. We also investigate the potential of crowd energy harvesting from transmission nodes that belong to multiple radio networks. The combination of source and crowd energy harvesting can greatly reduce the use of battery power and increase the availability and reliability for relaying. We provide insight into the fundamental limits of crowd energy harvesting reliability based on a case study using real city data. Furthermore, we examine the optimization of transmissions in crowd harvesting, especially with the use of node collaboration while guaranteeing quality of service.",

   "abstract": "The people-centric Internet of Things, as an essential part of the general IoT ecosystem, relies heavily on intelligent wearables to control and actuate the ambient/remote \u201cthings\u201d according to the sensed information or collected instruction from the specific person. Intelligent wearables, although becoming increasingly prevalent and pervasive, are vulnerable to various cyber-attacks due to their intrinsic characteristics, which consequently brings up unprecedented security challenges in terms of privacy leakage, financial loss, and even malicious invasion of other connected IoT components and applications. Therefore, it is of great necessity to keep intelligent wearables reliable and trustworthy before being able to secure the core parts of IoT. Toward this end, we provide in this article a survey of available attack methodologies on intelligent wearables as well as the corresponding countermeasures, from the perspectives of data integrity, authenticity, and privacy.",

   "abstract": "Despite improvements and expansion of cellular coverage in developing regions, a substantial qualitative divide remains. Maps that display the presence or absence of cellular coverage mask critical differences in infrastructure performance and client load. In order to illuminate challenges faced by users of such mobile networks, we collect and analyze GSM network measurements at the local scale. We discover higher network congestion in developing regions as well as performance differences between available carriers in each location. Based on our findings, we propose an app, called SmartCell, that informs and empowers users in near real time to seek out improved mobile connectivity.",

   "abstract": "The classic centralized infrastructure (CI) exhibits low efficiency in disseminating the content of common interest across its requesters. In order to overcome the limitations of CI-based content dissemination, smart mobile devices are capable of activating direct opportunistic communications among mobile users, which returns in integrated cellular and opportunistic networks. During the content dissemination process, the social characteristics of multiple users, including their common interest in the content, their mobility patterns, their social ties, and their altruistic forwarding behaviors, should be carefully considered in order to design an efficient content dissemination scheme. We demonstrate that the integrated network-based content dissemination scheme outperforms its CI-based counterpart in terms of both content delivery ratio and its various energy and delay metrics. Furthermore, the opportunistic network is capable of offloading a large fraction of tele-traffic from the overloaded CI-based network.",

   "abstract": "Tomorrow's society will see hosts of people constantly on the move, commuting between home and work, meeting up with family and friends or visiting shopping centers and leisure facilities. While on their way, these people use mobile devices to connect to the Internet, utilizing journey time for work-related tasks, entertainment, or socializing in online communities. Current fourth generation cellular networks are, however, not designed to efficiently serve large numbers of comparatively high-mobility users, often causing insufficient service quality while on the move. Machine-type communication will cause further aggravation, with wirelessly connected sensors that constantly monitor/record our environment, and vehicles that autonomously exchange traffic- and safety-relevant information. In this article, we highlight challenges that must be addressed by future mobile communications to enable efficient support of large numbers of highly mobile users in networks that are crowded with quasi-static (nomadic) users. We survey existing solutions and put special emphasis on open issues and competing priorities.",

To enhance the flexibility and efficiency of Energy Internet, this article employs the methodology of SDN in Energy Internet and proposes an SDEI architecture. In the SDEI, the control, data, and energy planes are separated. The control plane dynamically reconfigures the data and energy planes and achieves flexible cooperation between them. We then focus on applying an SDN approach to energy router networking, and build a hierarchical energy control architecture that can implement the programmability of energy flow and allow P2P energy delivery from a high-level view. Additionally, we present a case study of future EVs, for which two applications within the SDEI framework are proposed to improve energy efficiency and green energy utilization.",

Nevertheless, these three important areas have traditionally been addressed separately in existing works. In this article, we propose a novel framework that jointly considers networking, caching, and computing techniques in a systematic way to naturally support energy-efficient information retrieval and computing services in green wireless networks. This integrated framework can enable dynamic orchestration of different resources to meet the requirements of next generation green wireless networks. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges in implementing the proposed framework in next generation green wireless networks.",

   "abstract": "We present software defined access (SDA), an architecture for HetNets that incorporates various elements of SDN and software defined wireless networking (SDWN). SDA introduces a novel logical control path across radio interfaces and up to mobile devices. This control path allows SDA to regulate and configure data path via different RATs. Unlike SDN and SDWN, SDA can be deployed without changing network elements of RATs. The userspace implementation of client side utility is also presented to empower mobile devices with SDN-like flow management. This client with cloud hosted SDA servers presents an alternative for operator-independent and RAT-agnostic standalone SDA deployment. To demonstrate some of SDA's capabilities, we also present various testbed experimental measurement results.",

   "abstract": "To meet the surging demand of increasing mobile Internet traffic from diverse applications while maintaining moderate energy cost, the radio access network of cellular systems needs to take a green path into the future, and the key lies in providing elastic service to dynamic traffic demands. To achieve this, it is time to rethink RAN architectures and expect breakthroughs. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art literature, which aims to renovate RANs from the perspectives of control- traffic decoupled air interface, cloud-based RANs, and software-defined RANs. We then propose a software-defined hyper-cellular architecture (SDHCA) that identifies a feasible way to integrate the above three trends to enable green and elastic wireless access. We further present key enabling technologies to realize SDHCA, including separation of the air interface, green base station operations, and base station functions virtualization, followed by our hardware testbed for SDHCA. In addition, we summarize several future research issues worth investigating.",

   "abstract": "The increasing deployment of cellular networks across the globe has brought two issues to the forefront: the energy cost of running these networks and the associated environmental impact. Also, most of the recent growth in cellular networks has been in developing countries, where the unavailability of reliable electricity grids forces operators to use sources like diesel generators for power, which not only increases operating costs but also contributes to pollution. Cellular base stations powered by renewable energy sources such as solar power have emerged as one of the promising solutions to these issues. This article presents an overview of the state-of- the-art in the design and deployment of solar powered cellular base stations. The article also discusses current challenges in the deployment and operation of such base stations and some of the proposed solutions.",

   "abstract": "Sensing cost and data quality are two primary concerns in mobile crowd sensing. In this article, we propose a new crowd sensing paradigm, sparse mobile crowd sensing, which leverages the spatial and temporal correlation among the data sensed in different sub-areas to significantly reduce the required number of sensing tasks allocated, thus lowering overall sensing cost (e.g., smartphone energy consumption and incentives) while ensuring data quality. Sparse mobile crowdsensing applications intelligently select only a small portion of the target area for sensing while inferring the data of the remaining unsensed area with high accuracy. We discuss the fundamental research challenges in sparse mobile crowdsensing, and design a general framework with potential solutions to the challenges. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a sparse mobile crowdsensing prototype for temperature and traffic monitoring is implemented and evaluated. With several future research directions identified in sparse mobile crowdsensing, we expect that more research interests will be stimulated in this novel crowdsensing paradigm.",

   "abstract": "Crowdsourcing relies on the contributions of a large number of workers to accomplish spatial tasks, and it has drawn more attention in recent years. Many crowdsourcing tasks are completed online due to its convenience and efficiency. However, sometimes this traditional method may not work due to special requirements involving actual physical locations. Thus, a new paradigm of data collection, called spatial crowdsourcing, has emerged in the past few years. Spatial crowdsourcing consists of location-specific tasks that require people to physically be at specific locations to complete them. In this article we discuss unique challenges of spatial crowdsourcing, provide a comprehensive view of this new paradigm by introducing the taxonomy, and give future directions.",

   "abstract": "Motivated by the specific characteristics of mmWave technologies, we discuss the possibility of an authorization regime that allows spectrum sharing between multiple operators, also referred to as spectrum pooling. In particular, considering user rate as the performance measure, we assess the benefit of coordination among networks of different operators, study the impact of beamforming at both base stations and user terminals, and analyze the pooling performance at different frequency carriers. We also discuss the enabling spectrum mechanisms, architectures, and protocols required to make spectrum pooling work in real networks. Our initial results show that, from a technical perspective, spectrum pooling at mmWave has the potential to use the resources more efficiently than traditional exclusive spectrum allocation to a single operator. However, further studies are needed in order to reach a thorough understanding of this matter, and we hope that this article will help stimulate further research in this area.",

   "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides a great opportunity to many vertical industries because IoT interconnects various devices such as sensors and actuators and collects/processes data from them in order to improve services and reduce costs. As there exists many IoT technologies in the market, global standards and interworking mechanisms are critical to the success of the IoT. This article introduces standardized interworking interfaces and procedures based on oneM2M global standards, and tests them through use cases involving multiple IoT service platforms. The interworking involves smart city applications/services running on multiple IoT service layer platforms interoperating with each other. The main purpose of the interworking experiment is to show how machine-to-machine (M2M)/IoT service providers are using oneM2M compliant service layer platforms to deliver services more efficiently across multiple technology domains such as smart city. Because the deployment configurations of this interworking experiment span multiple domains, and the IoT devices and platforms are from different companies, we believe that this interworking experiment clearly proves that global IoT standards specifications can foster implementations of a service layer that enables services and interoperability between devices/device networks and cloud-based applications.",

   "abstract": "Media synchronization is getting renewed attention with ecosystems of connected devices enabling novel media consumption paradigms. Social TV, hybrid TV, and companion screens are examples that are enabling people to consume multiple media streams at multiple devices together. These novel use cases require media synchronization, as unfortunately there are substantial delay differences between the various delivery routes for television and streaming media. Broadcasters have started using proprietary solutions for over-the-top media synchronization, such as media fingerprinting or media watermarking technologies. Given the commercial interest in media synchronization and the disadvantages of proprietary technologies, consumer-equipment manufacturers, broadcasters, and telecom and cable operators have started developing a new wave of international standards for media synchronization. This article provides an overview of recently published standards from the most relevant bodies: IETF, ETSI, MPEG, DVB, HbbTV, and W3C.",

This article presents the design of a deterministic IIoT core network consisting of many simple deterministic packet switches configured by an SDN control plane. The use of deterministic communications can reduce router buffer sizes by a factor of \u2265 1000, and can reduce end-to-end latencies to the speed of light in fiber. A speed-of-light deterministic core network can have a profound impact on virtually all consumer services such as multimedia distribution, e-Commerce, and cloud computing or gaming systems. Highly aggregated video streams can be delivered over a deterministic virtual network with very high link utilization (\u2264 100 percent), very low packet jitter (\u2264 10 \u03bcs), and zero congestion. In addition to improving consumer services, a converged deterministic IIoT core network can save billions of dollars per year as a result of significantly improved network utilization and energy efficiency.",

   "abstract": "The need to manage the energy consumption of network infrastructure has been addressed by a significant body of work in recent years. In general, energy management capabilities were developed independently and optimized for particular network layers and node features. The interaction between multiple such green capabilities when deployed simultaneously, as well as potential interactions with other existing functionality such as quality of service functions, need to be managed transparently by the operators. We developed SLIM, the SustainabiLity Information Model for Energy Efficiency Policies, as an addon to the IETF Policy Core Information Model Extension to allow unifying the management of green capabilities throughout the network. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by presenting a use case and describing an energy management system where SLIM was used.",

   "abstract": "Given the anticipated 1000 times growth of tele-traffic, the conception of efficient spectrum management and sharing mechanisms becomes essential for 5G networks due to the scarcity of spectral resources. To meet this ambitious goal, we propose an SDN-based synergistic spectrum sharing technique, the harmonized SDN-enabled approach (HSA), which relies on distributed input reporting on spectrum availabilities in 5G heterogeneous networks. Conventional spectrum sharing mechanisms, particularly those using cognitive radio techniques, rely heavily on spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission-aided communications devices. However, this device-level spectrum sharing might lead to inaccurate sharing decisions due to the widely fluctuating signal quality observed by each device. Moreover, the network becomes vulnerable to malicious devices that report false sensing data to gain unfair access to the spectrum. These problems are further compounded by the fact that operational cellular networks have a somewhat rigid architecture relying on vendor-specific configuration interfaces, hence restricting the operators to have, at best, only indirect control of the network's operation and resources. In addressing these challenges, we adopt a synergistic approach that integrates the distributed sensing devices, cellular base stations, and SDN controller into an intrinsically amalgamated network. To alleviate any potential controller scalability and latency concerns, HSA harmonizes the network's operation by distributing the local decision making and network-wide policy making tasks among the base stations and the SDN controller, respectively. The article outlines the detailed network architecture and also presents an efficient resource management algorithm.",

Then the advantage of the array-of-subarrays structure is explained through comparison with the fully connected structure in both spectral and energy efficiency. Furthermore, a distance-aware multi-carrier scheme with the array-of-subarrays structure is introduced for wideband terahertz communications.

   "abstract": "The development of every new generation of wireless communication systems starts with bold, high-level requirements and predictions of its capabilities. The 5G system will not only have to surpass previous generations with respect to rate and capacity, but also address new usage scenarios with very diverse requirements, including various kinds of machine-type communication. Following this, the METIS project has developed a 5G system concept consisting of three generic 5G services: extreme mobile broadband, massive machine-type communication, and ultra-reliable MTC, supported by four main enablers: a lean system control plane, a dynamic radio access network, localized contents and traffic flows, and a spectrum toolbox. This article describes the most important system-level 5G features, enabled by the concept, necessary to meet the very diverse 5G requirements. System-level evaluation results of the METIS 5G system concept are presented, and we conclude that the 5G requirements can be met with the proposed system concept.",

   "abstract": "In cellular networks, the locations of the RAN elements are determined mainly based on the long-term traffic behavior. However, when the random and hard-to-predict spatio-temporal distribution of the traffic (load, demand) does not fully match the fixed locations of the RAN elements (supply), some performance degradation becomes inevitable. The concept of multi-tier cells (heterogeneous networks, HetNets) has been introduced in 4G networks to alleviate this mismatch. However, as the traffic distribution deviates more and more from the long-term average, even the HetNet architecture will have difficulty in coping with the erratic supply-demand mismatch, unless the RAN is grossly over-engineered (which is a financially non-viable solution). In this article, we study the opportunistic utilization of low-altitude unmanned aerial platforms equipped with BSs (i.e., drone-BSs) in future wireless networks. In particular, we envisage a multi-tier drone-cell network complementing the terrestrial HetNets. The variety of equipment and non-rigid placement options allow utilizing multi-tier drone-cell networks to serve diversified demands. Hence, drone-cells bring the supply to where the demand is, which sets new frontiers for the heterogeneity in 5G networks. We investigate the advancements promised by dronecells and discuss the challenges associated with their operation and management. We propose a drone-cell management framework (DMF) benefiting from the synergy among SDN, network functions virtualization, and cloud computing. We demonstrate DMF mechanisms via a case study, and numerically show that it can reduce the cost of utilizing drone-cells in multi-tenancy cellular networks.",

   "abstract": "The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires a well-defined infrastructure of systems that provides services for device abstraction and data management, and also supports the development of applications. Middleware for IoT has been recognized as the system that can provide these services and has become increasingly important for IoT in recent years. The large amount of data that flows into a middleware system demands a security architecture that ensures the protection of all layers of the system, including the communication channels and border APIs used to integrate the applications and IoT devices. However, this security architecture should be based on lightweight approaches since middleware systems are widely applied in constrained environments. Some works have already defined new solutions and adaptations to existing approaches in order to mitigate IoT middleware security problems. In this sense, this article discusses the role of lightweight approaches to the standardization of a security architecture for IoT middleware systems. This article also analyzes concepts and existing works, and presents some important IoT middleware challenges that may be addressed by emerging lightweight security approaches in order to achieve the consolidation of a standard security architecture and the mitigation of the security problems found in IoT middleware systems.",

   "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a massive penetration of cellular systems in developing countries. However, isolated rural areas (sparsely inhabited by low-income population) have been disregarded because classical access and backhaul technologies do not ensure the return on investment. This article presents innovative techno-economical solutions to provide these areas with cellular voice and data services. We first analyze the general characteristics of isolated rural communities, and based on this information, low-cost solutions are designed for both access (using 3G access points) and backhaul networks (using non-carrier grade equipment as WiFi for long distances or WiMAX in non-licensed bands). Subsequently, a study of population-dependent income vs. costs is presented, and a new business model is proposed involving mobile network operators, rural operators, and infrastructure providers. In order to test these solutions, we have built two demonstration platforms in the Peruvian jungle that have allowed validation of the technical feasibility of the solution, verifying the business model assumptions and the scalability of the initiative.",

   "abstract": "Due to the ever growing popularity of smart handheld devices, the demand for multimedia services has had an upsurge in mobile networks over the past several years, and traditional mobile networking is turning into a content-centric mobile networking (CCMN). To maintain high quality of service for multimedia services, especially video services, caching is regarded as one of the most effective techniques. In this article, we first examine the limitations of caching techniques in conventional CCMN, including the core network and RAN. Then, by leveraging cloud computing into both core network and RAN caching, a cloud CCMN architecture is discussed, which overcomes the limitations of conventional CCMN architecture. Specifically, we elaborate on a cloud content delivery network in the core network and cloud RAN with caching as a service on the RAN side. Furthermore, we review the main problems that have been studied under cloud CCMN architecture. Recent results show that cloud CCMN is a promising architecture to serve the foreseen multimedia traffic. Lastly, we conclude this article by presenting some open challenges in cloud CCMN.",

   "abstract": "Over the past decade, the successive approximation register (SAR) architecture has played a significant role in advancing the state of the art in analog-to-digital conversion. One of the primary reasons for this is that modern SAR ADCs thrive on MOS switches and latches, which strongly benefit from technology scaling. Building on this observation, this article compares the strengths and limitations of SAR ADCs against those of competing topologies and projects and related performance bounds. In this context, we also discuss application-specific considerations, specifically for ultra-low power and ultra-high speed (time-interleaved) application scenarios.",

A very low roundtrip latency in conjunction with ultra-high reliability and essentially guaranteed availability for control communications has the potential to move today\u2019s mobile broadband experience into the new world of the Tactile Internet for a race with (rather than against) machines. To facilitate a better understanding of the Tactile Internet, this article first elaborates on the commonalities and subtle differences between the Tactile Internet and the Internet of Things and 5G vision. After briefly reviewing its anticipated impact on society and infrastructure requirements, we then provide an up-to-date survey of recent progress and enabling technologies proposed for the Tactile Internet. Given that scaling up research in the area of future wired and wireless access networks will be essential for the Tactile Internet, we pay particular attention to the latency and reliability performance gains of fiber-wireless (FiWi) enhanced LTE-Advanced heterogeneous networks and their role for emerging cloudlets, mobile-edge computing, and cloud robotics. Finally, we conclude by outlining remaining open challenges for the Tactile Internet.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we present the notion of \"mobile 3C systems\" in which communications, computing, and caching (i.e., 3C) make up the three primary resources/functionalities, akin to the three primary colors, of a mobile system. We argue that in future mobile networks, the roles of computing and caching are as intrinsic and essential as communications, and only the collective usage of these three primary resources can support the sustainable growth of mobile systems. By defining the 3C resources in their canonical forms, we reveal the important fact that caching affects the mobile system performance by introducing non-causality into the system, whereas computing achieves capacity gains by performing logical operations across mobile system entities. Many existing capacity-enhancing techniques such as coded multicast, collaborative transmissions, and proactive content pushing can be cast in the native 3C framework for analytical tractability. We further illustrate the mobile 3C concepts with practical examples, including a system on broadcast-unicast convergence for massive media content delivery. The mobile 3C design paradigm opens up new possibilities as well as key research problems bearing academic and practical significance.",

   "abstract": "Network neutrality has been topic of discussion for the past 25 years, with current legislation/ regulation in the United States and Europe targeting the ISPs or \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d But the reality of the Internet in the 2010s is that various actors contribute to the delivery of data, with sometimes contradictory objectives. In this article, we highlight the fact that neutrality principles can be bypassed in many ways without violating the rules currently evoked in the debate; for example, via CDNs, which deliver content on behalf of content providers for a fee, or via search engines, which can hinder competition and innovation by affecting the visibility and accessibility of content. We therefore call for an extension of the net neutrality debate to all the actors involved in the Internet delivery chain. We particularly challenge the definition of net neutrality as it is generally discussed. Our goal is to initiate a relevant debate on net neutrality in an increasingly complex Internet ecosystem, and to provide examples of possible neutrality rules for different levels of the delivery chain, this level separation being inspired by the OSI layer model.",

From the perspective of the energy management system in manufacturing, reducing this consumption is not only a matter of exhibiting environmental responsibility, but also of substantially reducing the production cost. We discuss how dynamic energy management in manufacturing systems can not only solve the current technical issues in manufacturing, but can also aid in the integration of additional energy equipment into energy systems. We quantitatively estimate these potential savings through analysis of a simple manufacturing process. We also address a future research direction, wherein advanced manufacturing systems such as Industry 4.0 are deployed.",

   "abstract": "One of the major impediments to providing broadband connectivity in semi-urban and rural India is the lack of robust and affordable backhaul. Fiber connectivity in terms of backhaul that is being planned (or provided) by the Government of India would reach only up to the rural offices (called Gram Panchayat) in Indian villages. In this exposition, we articulate how TV white space can address the challenge in providing broadband connectivity to a billion plus population within India. The villages can form local Wi-Fi clusters. The problem of connecting the Wi-Fi clusters to the optical fiber points can be addressed using a TV white space based backhaul (middle mile) network. The amount of TV white space present in India is very large when compared to the developed world. Therefore, we discuss a backhaul architecture for rural India that utilizes TV white spaces. We also present results from our TV white space testbed that support the effectiveness of backhaul by using TV white spaces. Our testbed provides a broadband access network to rural populations in seven villages. The testbed is deployed over an area of 25 km<sup>2</sup>, and extends seamless broadband connectivity from optical fiber locations or Internet gateways to remote (difficult to connect) rural regions. We also discuss standards and TV white space regulations, which are pertinent to the backhaul architecture mentioned above.",

   "abstract": "Fourth generation LTE has been selected by U.S. federal and EU authorities to be the technology for public safety networks that would allow first responders to seamlessly communicate between agencies and across geographical locations in tactical and emergency scenarios. From Release 11 on, 3GPP has been developing and specifying dedicated nationwide public safety broadband networks that will be scalable, robust, and resilient, and can address the specific communication needs of emergency services. In this realm, the requirements and scenarios for isolated E-UTRAN with no or limited backhaul access to the core network are still in progress. In this article, we survey possible public safety use cases with the induced network topologies, discuss the current status of the 3GPP standards, and highlight future challenges. We further elaborate on the need to support mobile backhauling in moving-cell scenarios and describe two LTEbased solutions to enable dynamic meshing among the base stations.",

   "abstract": "In recent years, the smart home field has caught wide attention and witnessed rapid development. Smart devices, continuously increasing in number, make user management and implementation more difficult while promoting the development of the smart home. How to design an efficient smart home management platform is one of the great challenges the current smart home field faces. This article refers to the core idea of SDN, and proposed the software defined smart home platform, SDSH for short. The design features of virtualization, openness, and centralization can effectively integrate the heterogeneous network devices in the smart home platform, and flexibly adapt to the great difference between family scenes and user demands. At the same time, this article brings up the core technology of SDSH, and discusses the application value of the four core technologies and the new challenges the current technology is facing in a smart home scenario. In the end, regarding the SDSH application scenarios, this article analyzes the household experience innovation brought by this kind of smart home management platform, and the opportunities and challenges the SDSH platform faces.",

   "abstract": "Battlefield networking (BN) considers each network entity as a network in itself, composed of several communication technologies usually interconnected by multiple satellites. In this context, we must consider the intrinsic properties of military contexts to apply SDN in BN to get more flexibility and programmability in network-centric operations. For instance, BN considers several communication technologies, as well as the distinct application requirements on the traffic transmitted over BN in terms of QoS and security features in dynamic environments, where flexible network-centric operations are mandatory. In this article, we define an SDBN architecture that adapts SDN technology to BN, enabling SDNbased applications, methods, and policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed architecture in this article is the first one aimed at integrating BN and SDN into dynamic and heterogeneous network-centric environments.",

   "abstract": "Many years of research have been dedicated toward the definition of sophisticated quality of service (QoS) measurement tools and methods. Nonetheless, the results given to end users by most commonly used online speed measurement tools are still far from being accurate. Among other factors, the reliability of the measurement methods is affected by different static and dynamic constraints of involved network nodes and TCP/IP implementations. The clarification of such uncertainties will help establish the baseline for the definition of any comparable and technically feasible measurement methodology, in terms of measurement periods, number of concurrent connections, and convergence time. This article presents a comprehensive description of the research work and proposes mechanisms, aiming to obtain a full understanding of cross-layer effects during a speed test targeting end users.",

   "abstract": "Advancement in communication and computing technology is driving the next-generation electrical smart grid, SG. SG envisions developing user-centric distributed systems to offer cost-effective and reliable power supply. Its effectiveness depends highly on consumer awareness and engagement. SG deployments and programs have been found to be lacking in active consumer participation. We address this by proposing a techno-social framework for SG, TSSG, wherein technologies related to energy infrastructure interface with social activities of consumers. Social interactions play a crucial role in preferences of consumers and the decisions they make. The rapid evolution of social networks now enables us to model and capture these interactions. The proposed framework combines social networks with energy networks to understand individual and collective behavior of consumers in order to change the energy demand patterns. We describe several mechanisms to enable harnessing useful data from such a framework, including its applicability to various SG applications. Specifically, we illustrate the benefits of collective modeling of techno-social aspects by developing goal-oriented virtual communities. This is one of the first articles to consider both energy consumption information and characteristics of consumers to determine such communities. We employed data from a real-world SG deployment with more than 4000 households along with their preferences, opinions, and interests to evaluate our proposal.",

   "abstract": "Industrial WSNs are evolving to become the key interconnection between management and factory products in large-scale petrochemical plants. Apart from improved manufacturing, asset tracking, and robotic applications, toxic gas detection is one of the major issues in petrochemical plants, since toxic gas leakage can severely threaten the safety of first-line working staff. Continuous object detection, one of the major applications in WSNs, has become an important research topic in large-scale industry. This article overviews continuous object detection techniques that have emerged in recent years. Most of the research focuses on the estimation of the toxic gas boundary. However, an accurate boundary is less likely to be detected due to the nature (e.g., invisibility, fast movement, and changing shape) of toxic gas. Thus, it is essential to ensure the boundary area rather than only the boundary of the toxic gas. We propose a novel boundary area detection technique with planarization algorithms like RNG and GG. Exhaustive simulation studies enable us to find an optimal trade-off point between the cost of a number of deployed sensor nodes and the accuracy of the estimated toxic gas boundary area size.",

   "abstract": "In this article we present a novel solution to transfer users between IMS network elements. This solution enables a home operator to perform an appropriate redistribution of load among the call session control functions of the IMS, which can be deployed as virtualized network functions or over dedicated machines. This way, the operator is enabled to adequately accommodate the instantaneous load generated by users to the available control resources, which may dynamically be activated or deactivated as necessary, as well as to enhance the resilient operation of the IMS deployment. Additionally, our solution does not require any change to the IMS specifications, and at the same time, the procedures are transparent to the end-user applications running at the IMS terminals. Finally, we describe some results obtained with a proof-ofconcept implementation of the procedures presented in the article in order to show the viability and correctness of our proposal.",

   "abstract": "Unveiling network and service performance issues in complex and highly decentralized systems such as the Internet is a major challenge. Indeed, the Internet is based on decentralization and diversity. However, its distributed nature leads to operational brittleness and difficulty in identifying the root causes of performance degradation. In such a context, network measurements are a fundamental pillar to shed light on and unveil design and implementation defects. To tackle this fragmentation and visibility problem, we recently conceived mPlane, a distributed measurement platform that runs, collects, and analyzes traffic measurements to study the operation and functioning of the Internet. In this article, we show the potentiality of the mPlane approach to unveil network and service degradation issues in live operational networks, involving both fixed-line and cellular networks. In particular, we combine active and passive measurements to troubleshoot problems in end-customer Internet access connections, or to automatically detect and diagnose anomalies in Internet-scale services (e.g., YouTube) that impact a large number of end users.",

   "abstract": "Using LTE in unlicensed bands will allow operators to access additional spectrum to meet the increasing demand for mobile services. In this article, we provide an overview of the different approaches currently being considered for LTE operation in unlicensed bands and their interaction with WiFi networks. In summary, LTE-Unlicensed with carrier sense adaptive transmission is likely to be available in the short term, but cannot be used in all regions due to regulatory restrictions. License assisted access is intended for use more widely, so it will include listen-before-talk and other features required to conform with, for example, European and Japanese regulations. However, this will require changes to the LTE standards, so license assisted access is likely to take longer to deploy. In addition to describing the trade-offs between these approaches, we also discuss the issue of fair coexistence with existing unlicensed band users, especially WiFi devices.",

   "abstract": "With the widespread popularity and usage of ICT around the world, there is increasing interest in replacing the traditional electric grid by the smart grid in the near future. Many smart devices exist in the smart grid environment. These devices may share their data with one another using the ICT-based infrastructure. The analysis of the data generated from various smart devices in the smart grid environment is one of the most challenging tasks to be performed as it varies with respect to parameters such as size, volume, velocity, and variety. The output of the data analysis needs to be transferred to the end users using various networks and smart appliances. But sometimes networks may become overloaded during such data transmissions to various smart devices. Consequently, significant delays may be incurred, which affect the overall performance of any implemented solution in this environment. We investigate the use of VDTNs as one of the solutions for data dissemination to various devices in the smart grid environment using mobile edge computing. VDTNs use the store-and-carry forward mechanism for message dissemination to various smart devices so that delays can be reduced during overloading and congestion situations in the core networks. As vehicles have high mobility, we propose mobile edge network support assisted by the cloud environment to manage the handoff and the processing of large data sets generated by various smart devices in the smart grid environment. In the proposed architecture, most of the computation for making decisions about charging and discharging is done by mobile devices such as vehicles located at the edge of the network (also called mobile edge computing). The computing and communication aspects are explored to analyze the impact of mobile edge computing on performance metrics such as message transmission delay, response time, and throughput to the end users using vehicles as the mobile nodes. Our empirical results demonstrate an improved performance 10-15 percent increase in throughput, 20 percent decrease in response time, and 10 percent decrease in the delay incurred with our proposed solution compared to existing state-ofthe- art solutions in the literature.",

   "abstract": "Recently, charging management for EVs on the move has become an emerging research problem in urban cities. Major technical challenges here involve intelligence for the selection of CSs to guide drivers' charging plans, as well as the corresponding communication infrastructure for information dissemination between the power grid and EVs. In this article, a vehicular-P/S communication framework, in conjunction with PTBs, is provisioned to support on-the-move EV charging management. Benefiting from low privacy sensitivity, we propose a fully distributed charging management scheme concerning the driving intention. Results demonstrate guidance for the provisioning of a V-P/S communication framework, considering EV drivers' experience including charging wait time and total trip duration. Also, the benefit of a V-P/S communication framework is reflected in terms of communication efficiency. Open research issues of this emerging research area are also presented.",

   "abstract": "The standardization of the next generation 5G radio access technology has just started in 3GPP with the ambition of making it commercially available by 2020. There are a number of features that are unique for 5G radio access compared to the previous generations such as a wide range of carrier frequencies and deployment options, diverse use cases with very different user requirements, small-size base stations, self-backhaul, massive MIMO, and large channel bandwidths. In this article, we propose a flexible physical layer for the NR to meet the 5G requirements. A symmetric physical layer design with OFDM is proposed for all link types, including uplink, downlink, device-to-device, and backhaul. A scalable OFDM waveform is proposed to handle the wide range of carrier frequencies and deployments.",

   "abstract": "Ever since the inception of mobile telephony, the downlink and uplink of cellular networks have been coupled, that is, mobile terminals have been constrained to associate with the same base station in both the downlink and uplink directions. New trends in network densification and mobile data usage increase the drawbacks of this constraint, and suggest that it should be revisited. In this article we identify and explain five key arguments in favor of downlink/uplink decoupling based on a blend of theoretical, experimental, and architectural insights. We then overview the changes needed in current LTE-A mobile systems to enable this decoupling, and then look ahead to fifth generation cellular standards. We demonstrate that decoupling can lead to significant gains in network throughput, outage, and power consumption at a much lower cost compared to other solutions that provide comparable or lower gains.",

   "abstract": "The evolution of wireless communication from 4G toward 5G is driven by application demands and business models envisioned for 2020 and beyond. This requires network support for novel use cases in addition to classical mobile broadband services. Wireless factory automation is an application area with highly demanding communication requirements. We classify these requirements and identify the opportunities for the current LTE air interface for factory automation applications. Moreover, we give an outlook on the relevant design considerations to be addressed by 5G communication systems.",

   "abstract": "Caching is a hot research topic and poised to develop into a key technology for the upcoming 5G wireless networks. However, the successful implementation of caching techniques crucially depends on joint research developments in different scientific domains such as networking, information theory, machine learning, and wireless communications. Moreover, there are business barriers related to the complex interactions between the involved stakeholders: users, cellular operators, and Internet content providers. In this article we discuss several technical misconceptions with the aim of uncovering enabling research directions for caching in wireless systems. Ultimately, we make a speculative stakeholder analysis for wireless caching in 5G.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communication systems that include unmanned aerial vehicles promise to provide cost-effective wireless connectivity for devices without infrastructure coverage. Compared to terrestrial communications or those based on high-altitude platforms, on-demand wireless systems with low-altitude UAVs are in general faster to deploy, more flexibly reconfigured, and likely to have better communication channels due to the presence of short-range line-of-sight links. However, the utilization of highly mobile and energy-constrained UAVs for wireless communications also introduces many new challenges. In this article, we provide an overview of UAV-aided wireless communications, by introducing the basic networking architecture and main channel characteristics, highlighting the key design considerations as well as the new opportunities to be exploited.",

   "abstract": "Today, most of us take access to Wi-Fi (IEEE Std. 802.11n) for granted. That is what makes our daily lives go-around at home, in the office, or on the road with access to information across the Internet. Compared to the \"tethered\" Internet access of a few years ago, we became so much more mobile and productive having \"cut the cord.\" But one aspect of our technology usage that is still tied to cords is the need for power, even when you have battery operated devices. Think about all of the devices in our lives that require batteries to be recharged: wireless phones, laptops, electric vehicles, medical devices, all the fun wearables, and so much more. What if you didn't need to plug in a device to recharge its battery? Or what if your device didn't even need a battery for its power supply? There are a number of standards currently available and in development that support that capability through wireless power transfer (WPT) that can allow us to \"cut the cord\" to traditional power sources.",
