      "abstract": "In December 2007 the IEEE Standards Association approved the formation of the IEEE P802.3ba Task Force, which was chartered with the development of 40 Gb Ethernet and 100 Gb Ethernet. The decision to do both rates of Ethernet was scrutinized by the industry at the time, but ultimately the Higher Speed Study Group provided a vital forum for the stakeholders in the next generation of Ethernet to debate this very issue. The fact that this debate actually occurred is in itself a testament to the success of Ethernet. Networking applications, whose bandwidth requirements are doubling approximately every 18 months, have greater bandwidth demands than computing applications, where the bandwidth capabilities for servers are doubling approximately every 24 months. The impact of this difference in bandwidth growth is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is clear from these trend lines that if Ethernet is to provide a solution for both the computing and network application space, it needs to evolve past its own tradition of 10x leaps in operation rates with each successive generation.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic bandwidth allocation in passive optical networks presents a key issue for providing efficient and fair utilization of the PON upstream bandwidth while supporting the QoS requirements of different traffic classes. In this article we compare the typical characteristics of DBA, such as bandwidth utilization, delay, and jitter at different traffic loads, within the two major standards for PONs, Ethernet PON and gigabit PON. A particular PON standard sets the framework for the operation of DBA and the limitations it faces. We illustrate these differences between EPON and GPON by means of simulations for the two standards. Moreover, we consider the evolution of both standards to their next-generation counterparts with the bit rate of 10 Gb/s and the implications to the DBA. A new simple GPON DBA algorithm is used to illustrate GPON performance. It is shown that the length of the polling cycle plays a crucial but different role for the operation of the DBA within the two standards. Moreover, only minor differences regarding DBA for current and next-generation PONs were found.",

These algorithms will complement a flexible control and management plane integrated in the proposed solution. Physical layer impairments and optical performance are monitored and incorporated in impairment-aware lightpath routing algorithms. These algorithms will be integrated into a novel dynamic network planning tool that will consider dynamic traffic characteristics, a reconfigurable optical layer, and varying physical impairment and component characteristics. The network planning tool along with extended control planes will make it possible to realize the vision of optical transparency.

The interoperability trial demonstrated the routing of label switched paths over a multi-area GMPLS controlled ROADM/OXC network and the control of Ethernet over MPLS transport service on top of the GMPLS network. The trial was conducted using various network elements provided by 14 institutions and was carried out in Tokyo and Virginia. This article introduces the motivation for the trial, technical issues related to controlling multiarea MPLS/GMPLS networks, test network topology, and experimental results. The results show that the interior gateway routing protocol based multi-area routing architecture is a promising solution for the nationwide deployment of GMPLS networks within a carrier domain. In addition, this article discusses the technical issues of routing constraints in ROADM/OXC networks and the limit of multiarea routing without the Path Computation Element Protocol.",

A solution to this problem is developed that involves the use of irregular data formats. A new class of irregular floating-point formats is developed. A specific format is derived from this class that provides greater dynamic range and improved noise performance for 16-bit DSP applications. An experiment with one of the new formats is conducted and analyzed, and improved performance is verified. The importance of our work and its potential applications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In this article we study the behavior of voice over IP traffic in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Specifically, we design a QoS provisioning mechanism for VoIP traffic, and propose a practical solution of configuring the 802.11e enhanced distributed control access parameter sets for different types of traffic. We show that media access control layer only methods may be insufficient, but the demonstrated cross-layer (layers 2, 3, and 4) method works simply and efficiently. We find that the EDCA parameter sets of the access point are not always necessarily set more aggressively than those of wireless stations even though the traffic load of AP is much heavier than the stations. With our mechanism, the EDCA parameter sets can be easily configured via software interface for off-theshelf WiFi phone products, and there is no need to modify the operations of APs or 802.11 MAC layer protocols. The performance of our mechanism is evaluated via ns-2 simulations and via laboratory experiments over Quanta's O2 dual mode handsets. The results show our mechanism can provide effective and efficient QoS provisioning for VoIP traffic in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Since the configuration may be readily configured in the field and the performance is robust across a wide range of environments, we believe that organizations deploying and operating WiFi networks for VoIP may benefit from our work and reduce or eliminate post-deployment tuning and debugging.",

      "abstract": "Bluetooth<sup>copy</sup>radios are becoming pervasive in small, battery-powered devices. This is being driven by the reduced area requirements, cost, and power consumption of Bluetooth chips. As process technology scales down to 0.13 mum CMOS and beyond, the opportunities to trade off digital complexity to reduce analog requirements can enable optimized radio designs. This article presents an architecture on both the transmitter and receiver that can optimize this digital/analog trade-off while still meeting all system requirements. A polar transmitter is presented that is capable of transmitting both basic rate and enhanced data rate traffic. The low-IF receiver is also optimized, requiring very little analog filtering and using an oversampled analog- to-digital converter to move the filtering burden to the digital domain. The result is the smallest and lowest power Bluetooth radio published to date.",

      "abstract": "Light-handed regulation is discussed often in policy circles, but what it should mean technically has always been a bit vague. For cognitive radios to succeed in reducing the regulatory overhead, this has to change. For us, light-handed regulation means minimizing the mandates to be met at radio certification and relying instead on incentives to deter bad behavior. We put forth a specific technical framework in which the certification mandates are minimal - radios must modulate their transmitted waveform to embed an identity fingerprint, and radios must obey certain go-to-jail commands directed toward their identities. More specifically, the identity is represented by a temporal profile of taboo time slots in which transmission is impossible. The fraction of taboo slots represents the overhead of this approach and determines how reliably harmful interference can be attributed to the culprit(s) responsible. Meanwhile, the fraction of time that innocent radios spend in jail is the overhead for the punishment system. The analysis is carried out in the context of a real-time spectrum market, but is also applicable to opportunistic use.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation access networks must provide bandwidths in the range of 50-100 Mb/s per residential customer. Today, most broadband services are provided through copper-based VDSL or fiber-based GPON/EPON solutions. Candidates for next-generation broadband access networks include several variants of WDM-PONs. The total cost of ownership of these solutions is determined mainly by operational expenditures, where the cost of energy is one of the major contributors. We show that a combination of WDM-PON with active L2 switching can minimize the total cost of ownership while at the same time offering the highest scalability for future bandwidth demands.",

      "abstract": "Shrinking cell sizes, primarily a result of keeping up with the increasing demand for higher data rates, are stretching thin the notion of our traditional cellular system architecture. More and more base stations are serving smaller and smaller areas (cells) which in effect is driving up deployment costs. The option of deploying relay stations is increasingly beginning to look like a solution to the problem of providing a cost-effective way to extend the coverage and capacity in a cellular network. A relay station can be used to extend the point-to-multipoint link between the base station and mobile stations. Relay stations connect to the base stations without wires and are expected to be deployed to cover smaller geographic areas. Primarily the deployment costs but also the equipment costs are expected to be substantially lower than those of base stations. In this article we first introduce the relay station and discuss the place it is likely to carve out for itself in the traditional cellular architecture. We highlight the important economic and performance benefits relay stations could potentially offer, and outline a few scenarios where relays are likely to be deployed in the beginning. The multihop relay standard developed by the IEEE 802.16 working group is then used as a basis to provide an overview of the relay-enhanced cellular architecture and the key choices that can be made in developing relay support within a cellular system - a precursor to what can be expected in later releases of the Mobile WiMAX system. Finally, we discuss some future directions in the development of relay systems.",

      "abstract": "Radio resource management algorithms ranging from bearer admission control to semi-persistent and dynamic packet scheduling, fast link adaptation, and transmission control of multi-antenna transmission modes are addressed in this article for UTRAN long-term evolution. First, a high-level system overview of LTE is given, with special emphasis on the important components related to RRM. The quality of service parameter framework is outlined, as one of the main objectives for the families of RRM algorithms is to maximize system capacity while serving all users according to their minimum QoS constraints. It is demonstrated how the collocation of the RRM algorithms at the base station with easy access to air interface measurements offers opportunities for efficient cross-functional optimization between layers 1, 2, and 3. Examples of performance results for different traffic mixes and antenna transmission schemes are also presented, and the article is concluded with recommendations on how to operate the various RRM options under different load and traffic conditions.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for mobile Internet and wireless multimedia applications has motivated the development of broadband wireless access technologies in recent years. Mobile WiMAX has enabled convergence of mobile and fixed broadband networks through a common wide-area radio-access technology and flexible network architecture. Since January 2007, the IEEE 802.16 working group has been developing a new amendment of the IEEE 802.16 standard (i.e., IEEE 802.16m) as an advanced air interface to meet the requirements of ITU-R/IMT-advanced for 4G systems, as well as for the next-generation mobile network operators. Depending on the available bandwidth and multi-antenna mode, the next-generation mobile WiMAX will be capable of over-the-air data-transfer rates in excess of 1 Gb/s and of supporting a wide range of high-quality and high-capacity IP-based services and applications while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing mobile WiMAX systems to preserve investments and continuing to support first-generation products. This tutorial describes the prominent technical features of IEEE 802.16m and the potential for successful deployment of the next generation of mobile WiMAX in 2011+.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade or so, the wireless industry has undergone many significant changes. Radio systems have moved toward forming heterogeneous wireless networks: collaborations of multiple radio access networks, which in some cases operate different radio access technologies, such as second- and third-generation cellular RATs, IEEE 802.x wireless standards, and so on. On the other hand, multimode reconfigurable user devices with the ability to choose among various supported RATs have become a reality, and devices and networks with dynamic spectrum access capabilities, allowing real-time sharing of spectrum resource usage among different systems, are expected to be a part of the future radio eco-space. As a result of these changes, there is a need to develop a standard that addresses the requirements and leverages the opportunities posed by such a versatile radio environment. To this end, IEEE 1900.4 aims to standardize the overall system architecture and information exchange between the network and mobile devices, which will allow these elements to optimally choose from available radio resources. In other words, the standard facilitates the distributed dynamic optimization of the usage of spectrum offered by the heterogeneous wireless network, relying on a collaborative information exchange between networks and mobile devices, thereby acting as a common means to improve overall composite capacity and quality of service for the served networks. This article provides a snapshot of IEEE P1900.4 in its current form, covering the scope and purpose of the standard, reference use cases for which the standard is applicable, its system and functional architectures, and finally, the information model for its main interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Edwin H. Armstrong is well known as the inventor of wide-deviation or wideband FM. His patent on this invention was granted December 26, 1933, followed soon thereafter by demonstrations of his system before engineers, papers on the subject of wideband frequency modulation (FM) and its noise-suppression property, and eventually, of course, after World War II, widespread acceptance of FM by the radio industry and the public at large. The years in between were devoted to a bitter court fight between Armstrong and RCA, leading eventually to Armstrong's tragic suicide in 1954. This is well documented in the book by Lessing devoted to Armstrong's life (1969). What is not clear is precisely how and when Armstrong had the intuitive leap, his Eureka! moment, that led to this truly momentous invention. Armstrong was notorious for leaving very little documentation on his inventions. Lessing does note that Armstrong was fully occupied with his FM work, carrying out thousands of experiments, from 1928 to 1933, but no attempt to further narrow this interval of time down or discuss how he came to develop the wide-deviation FM concept is offered. We try, in this brief note, using documentation available in the Armstrong papers housed at Columbia University, to come to grips with these questions.",

      "abstract": "Low-power base stations such as femtocells are one of the candidates for high-data-rate provisioning in local areas, such as residences, apartment complexes, business offices, and outdoor hotspot scenarios. Unfortunately, the benefits are not without new challenges in terms of interference management and efficient system operation. Due to the expected large number of user-deployed cells, centralized network planning becomes impractical, and new scalable alternatives must be sought. In this article we propose a fully distributed and scalable solution to the interference management problem in local areas, basing our study case on LTEAdvanced. We present extensive network simulation results to demonstrate that a simple and robust interference management scheme, called autonomous component carrier selection, allows each cell to select the most attractive frequency configuration; improving the experience of all users and not just the few best ones, while overall cell capacity is not compromised.",

      "abstract": "Geographic routing has emerged as one of the most efficient and scalable routing solutions for wireless sensor networks. In traditional geographic routing protocols, each node exchanges periodic one-hop beacons to determine the position of its neighbors. Recent studies proved that these beacons can create severe problems in real deployments due to the highly dynamic and error-prone nature of wireless links. To avoid these problems, new variants of geographic routing protocols that do not require beacons are being proposed. In this article we review some of the latest proposals in the field of beacon-less geographic routing and introduce the main design challenges and alternatives. In addition, we perform an empirical study to assess the performance of beacon-based and beacon-less routing protocols using a real WSN deployment.",

As wireless standards evolve, the processing power needed for baseband processing increases dramatically and the underlying hardware needs to cope with various standards or even simultaneously maintaining several radio links. Meanwhile, the maximum power consumption allowed by mobile terminals is still strictly limited. These challenges require both system and architecture level innovations.

The LeoCore architecture is presented here as an example of a baseband processor design aimed at reducing power and silicon cost while maintaining sufficient flexibility.",

      "abstract": "The mobile WiMax system is based on IEEE 802.16e, which defines radio interface supporting several classes of Internet Protocol applications and services. While the mobile WiMax system is being deployed, IEEE 802.16m TG is developing an amendment to the IEEE 802.16e to greatly improve the system performance, and it is focusing not only on the PHY and MAC performance but also on a level of end-to-end performance improvement that includes the scope of the network and application to embrace the strong market request and interest. To evaluate the mobile WiMax system capacity and performance, all the aspects of performance evaluation - from air link to application - are required. For the network and application-level capacity and performance analysis, we first provide an overview of mobile WiMAX systems, especially of the OFDMA/TDD systems of IEEE 802.16e and then describe subscriber and application profiles that include traffic-mix ratio, data-session attempts for applications, diurnal-application traffic distribution, and the application-traffic model. Afterward, the simulation results of network- traffic characteristics and demand estimation are provided. Finally, in the last section, we provide simulation results of end-to-end application performance evaluation using the examples of VoIP and a TCP/IP performance-enhancement method that can be implemented in the mobile WiMAX MAC or MAC/IP cross layer.",

We note that these developments were based on the 1910 demonstration by Major George Squier of the United States Army Signal Corps of his \"wired wireless\" technique for transmitting multiple telephone channels over one pair of wires. Power companies world-wide picked up on this carrier-wave telephony technique for use over power lines, with electrical manufacturing companies such as GE and Westinghouse in the United States and Telefunken in Germany, among others, then developing a variety of systems for this purpose. By 1930, the technique had reached a period of maturity, with 1000 systems installed throughout Europe and the United States.",

We compare in detail the features, frame structures, performances, advantages and disadvantages, and technical challenges associated with TWRs and FDRs.

Compared to overlay multicast, IP multicast is less deployed but can achieve higher delivery efficiency. Researchers hence study how to combine IP multicast with overlay multicast in order to achieve both high deployability and high delivery efficiency. This combination is called island multicast. In this article we present a comprehensive survey of recent research on island multicast. We investigate the general architecture and key components of island multicast. We then discuss the core issue in island multicast: how to set up delivery connections across multiple multicast domains. We finally discuss open issues for future research.",

      "abstract": "GMPLS has introduced several enhancements to the MPLS-TE routing and signaling control plane protocols to handle dynamic lightpath provisioning in wavelength-routed networks. Specifically, the GMPLS signaling protocol has been enhanced to support two new provisioning functionalities, namely, the minimization of the setup delay, and the setup of bidirectional connection requests. In both cases, the source node must perform a wavelength allocation for either minimizing the setup delay (i.e., the suggested label) or requesting a bidirectional connection (i.e., the upstream label). However, these GMPLS provisioning functionalities present important deficiencies when applied to wavelength-routed networks with the wavelength continuity constraint, degrading the network performance considerably. The reason is that the standard GMPLS routing protocols flood link attributes only at bandwidth granularity, that is, no per-wavelength channel granularity is disseminated. Therefore, the source node is unable to perform an optimal wavelength assignment that fulfils the wavelength continuity constraint along the complete route toward the destination. In this article we present and experimentally evaluate an enhanced routing-based solution in the ADRENALINE testbed to handle the wavelength continuity constraint.",

      "abstract": "When supporting both voice and TCP in a wireless multihop network, there are two conflicting goals: to protect the VoIP traffic and to completely utilize the remaining capacity for TCP. We investigate the interaction between these two popular categories of traffic and find that many solution approaches, such as enhanced TCP variants, priority queues, bandwidth limitation, and traffic shaping, do not always achieve the coexistence goals. Enhanced TCP variants (Reno, Vegas, C-TCP, CUBIC, Westwood) generally fail to protect VoIP in wired-wireless multihop scenarios. Priority schemes, including those built into the 802.11 MAC such as RTS/CTS or 802.11e, do not account for the interference nature of wireless multihop. Finally, bandwidth shaping and window control are valid tools to control TCP, but come with their own trade-offs.",

In this article, we provide an overview of the coexistence studies that have been done. First we list the terminologies that are commonly used for coexistence studies, and explain how deterministic analysis can be done for the BS to BS interference scenario. Then we provide the system simulation methodology and assumptions used in the coexistence studies, and show some simulation results for the possible impacts with different system parameters. Finally we provide the references to the 3GPP standards where the LTE BS and UE radio transmission and reception requirements are specified to facilitate LTE coexistence with other mobile systems.",

With the advance in cognitive networking as a possible means of exploiting unused spectrum, there is now a growing need to study how to design a cognitive network using an automated methodology. In this article we study the concepts and challenges for automatic design/ reconfiguration of cognitive MANETs. We describe the design objectives, imposed constraints, and involved parameters in MANETs. We describe how cognitive techniques can be employed to exploit the unused spectrum in military architectures. We then discuss the challenges facing the design/reconfiguration of a cognitive network and their implications at different network layers. We also describe possible implementation options for designing MANETs that employ cognitive features at all layers.",

This article describes the use of DSA to resolve challenges in achieving wireless and cognitive radio operation in dense or energetic spectrum. It also demonstrates that the use of DSA can significantly reduce requirements for linearity and dynamic range in the radio front-end, and reduce the intermodulation induced noise floor through integration of DSA with the selection of front-end filter settings. This approach could enable DSA and cognitive radios to be more affordable than conventional radios, and addresses spectrum issues that are not practically manageable through manual approaches.",

It follows an earlier article in this Column on packet switching in the United Kingdom. We hope to publish additional papers on the history of packet switching from other countries as well. We are so used to the Internet and its amazing suite of ever growing applications that we may tend to forget that in the 1970s and well into the 1980s, common carriers and computer manufacturers worked together in a concerted effort to introduce data packet switching capability worldwide. This effort required the rapid development of an international standard, X.25. This standard, once introduced, led to quick deployment of multiple data networks in many countries, helping lay the groundwork for the Internet. The Canadian Datapac network, in particular, was the first network to fully implement the X.25 suite. Tony Rybczynski, the author of the article, was a key figure in these developments. He describes both the technical and political discussions involved in expediting the introduction of the standard and data networks using it. All readers of this magazine will, I feel, gain considerably in reading this article.",

      "abstract": "Tactical networking environments present significant challenges that must be overcome in order to effectively support net-centric warfare. The wireless and ad hoc nature of these networks implies unreliable connectivity, limited bandwidth, and variable latency. Past and current research has focused on physical and data link layers, routing protocols, transport protocols, and cross-layer aspects. However, significant work is needed at the upper layers to better support application requirements. In our experience, achieving effective communications in tactical environments requires taking into account application requirements and communication patterns, designing a rich interface between the application and communication layers, and realizing a communications middleware specifically adapted to tactical networks. In this article, we report on our observations from several tactical networking experiments and demonstrations and the lessons learned from deployment of the Mockets middleware to support tactical communications. We hope these experiences are useful to others designing and implementing applications and systems for tactical environments.",

      "abstract": "The protocols and architectures of the ad hoc networks of today reflect the severe memory and processing constraints that were imposed on computing equipment that was dedicated to communication tasks 40 years ago. As a result, most protocols are decoupled from the physical medium, each protocol layer operates independently of others, and processing and storage \"inside\" the network is kept to a minimum. We present the design and performance of a new approach to packet switching for MANETs, which we call a context-aware protocol engine. With a CAPE, nodes disseminate information in the network by means of context-aware packet switching, which enables the statistical multiplexing of bandwidth and the processing and storage of resources using integrated signaling that covers channel access, routing, and other functions, to share and store the context within which information is disseminated. Data packet headers consist of simple pointers to their context, and elections and opportunistic reservations integrated with routing are used to attain high throughput and low channel-access delay.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative networking, by leveraging the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, significantly improves system performance and constitutes a promising technology for next-generation wireless networks. Although there is a large body of literature on cooperative communications, most of the work is limited to theoretical or simulation studies. To impact the next generation of wireless technologies and standards, it is essential to demonstrate that cooperative techniques indeed work in practice. This article describes two programmable cooperative communication testbeds built at Polytechnic Institute of NYU to achieve this goal. The testbeds are based on open-source platforms and enable implementation of cooperative networking protocols in both the physical and the medium access control layer. Extensive experiments carried out using the testbeds suggest not only that cooperative communication techniques can be integrated into current wireless technologies, but also that significant benefits of cooperation can be observed in terms of network throughput, delay, and video quality in real applications.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that dynamic spectrum access can improve spectrum utilization significantly by allowing secondary unlicensed users to dynamically share the spectrum that is not used by the primary licensed users. Cognitive radio was proposed to promote the spectrum utilization by opportunistically exploiting the existence of spectrum \"holes.\" Meanwhile, cooperative relay technology is regarded widely as a key technology for increasing transmission diversity gain in various types of wireless networks, including cognitive radio networks. In this article, we first give a brief overview of the envisioned applications of: cooperative relay technology to CRNs, cooperative transmission of primary traffic by secondary users, cooperative transmission between secondary nodes to improve spatial diversity, and cooperative relay between secondary nodes to improve spectrum diversity. As the latter is a new direction, in this article we focus on this scenario and investigate a simple wireless network, where a spectrum-rich node is selected as the relay node to improve the performance between the source and the destination. With the introduction of cooperative relay, many unique problems should be considered, especially the issue for relay selection and spectrum allocation. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of cooperative relay for cognitive radio, a new MAC protocol was proposed and implemented in a universal software radio peripheral-based testbed. Experimental results show that the throughput of the whole system is greatly increased by exploiting the benefit of cooperative relay.",

      "abstract": "Enhanced discontinuous reception mode is supported in long term evolution of 3GPP standards to conserve the mobile terminal's battery power. Furthermore, there are additional advantages in using DRX, such as over-the-air resource saving on both the uplink and downlink to increase overall system capacity. One of the enhancements over 3G wireless systems is that in LTE DRX mode can be enabled even when the user equipment is registered with the evolved node-B. However, there is a need to optimize the DRX parameters, so as to maximize power saving without incurring network re-entry and packet delay. In particular, care should be exercised for real-time services. In this article the power saving methods in both network attached and network idle modes as outlined in LTE are explained. The optimum criteria to select the DRX mode are defined for different applications. Analytical/simulation results are presented to show the power saving/connection reestablishment and packet delay.",

The latest datarate amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard, known as the 802.11n, provides enhanced user experience by exploiting MIMO techniques that use multiple antennas for both transmitter and receiver. In conjunction with MAC layer improvements such as aggregating data, the 802.11n standard supports PHY data rates as high as 600 Mb/s with four spatial streams. This article discusses various MAC and PHY level modifications introduced in 802.11n, as well as the architecture, design trade-offs, and implementation details of a two spatial stream CMOS 802.11n-draft-compliant SoC.",

      "abstract": "The IP multimedia subsystem is a key component of 3G networks. It enables the seamless provision of multimedia services to end users. Multimedia conferencing is an important category of multimedia services in IMS, serving as the basis for a wide range of applications including audio/video conferencing, multiparty gaming and distance learning. Floor control is an advanced feature of multimedia conferencing which manages the access to shared resources such as audio and video channels. This article extends the 3GPP architecture to include the design and implementation of advanced multimedia conferencing applications. It separates the floor control server and the media resource function processor, and it also opens up advanced conferencing capabilities. A SIP-based floor server control markup language and a multi-level abstraction API are proposed. The extensions are illustrated by a case study based on the design and implementation of a multiparty multimedia game. An important finding of this article is that tools and technologies for the design and implementation of multimedia conferencing applications in IMS are relatively immature. We therefore caution designers and implementers that they may need to develop additional tools and technologies to complete their projects, just as we did in the work presented in this article.",

Models play a key role in evaluating varied design options and assist in discovering design issues that likely will impact performance. In the service delivery platform, spreadsheet models can be applied to learn about strategic traffic volume, estimate end-to-end latencies and box capacities, whereas more complex simulation models can help to clarify an understanding of the dynamic aspects and trade-offs that influence the end-user experience.

      "abstract": "The demand on wireless communications to provide high data rates, high mobility, and high quality of service poses more challenges for designers. To contend with deleterious channel fading effects, both the transmitter and the receiver must be designed appropriately to exploit the diversity embedded in the channels. From the perspective of receiver design, the ultimate goal is to achieve both low complexity and high performance. In this article, we first summarize the complexity and performance of low-complexity receivers, including linear equalizers and decision feedback equalizers, and then we reveal the fundamental condition when LEs and DFEs collect the same diversity as the maximum-likelihood equalizer. Recently, lattice reduction techniques were introduced to enhance the performance of low-complexity equalizers without increasing the complexity significantly. Thus, we also provide a comprehensive review of LR-aided low-complexity equalizers and analyze their performance. Furthermore, we describe the architecture and initial results of a very-large-scale-integration implementation of an LR algorithm.",

The approach of the study is a tight integration of D2D communication into an LTE-Advanced network. In particular, we propose mechanisms for D2D communication session setup and management involving procedures in the LTE System Architecture Evolution. Moreover, we present numerical results based on system simulations in an interference limited local area scenario. Our results show that D2D communication can increase the total throughput observed in the cell area.",

Here, we present our QKD experiments based on the differential- phase-shift QKD protocol. A DPSQKD system has a simple configuration that is easy to implement with conventional optical communication components, and it is suitable for a high-clock rate system. Moreover, although the DPS-QKD system is implemented with an attenuated laser source, it is inherently secure against strong eavesdropping attacks called photon number-splitting attacks, which pose a serious threat to conventional QKD systems with attenuated laser sources. We also describe three types of single-photon detectors that are suitable for high-speed, long-distance QKD: an up-conversion detector, a superconducting single-photon detector, and a sinusoidally gated InGaAs avalanche photodiode. We present our recordsetting QKD experiments that employed those detectors.",

Cooperative communication has been proposed recently as an effective way to mitigate channel impairments. With cooperation, single-antenna mobile terminals in a multi-user environment share antennas from other mobiles to generate a virtual multiple-antenna system that achieves more reliable communication with a higher diversity gain. However, more mobiles conscribed for one communication inevitably induces complex medium access interactions, especially in multihop wireless ad hoc networks. To improve the network throughput and diversity gain simultaneously, we investigate the issues and challenges in designing an efficient MAC scheme for such networks. Furthermore, based on the IEEE 802.11 DCF, a cross-layer designed cooperative MAC protocol is proposed. The MAC scheme adapts to the channel condition and payload length.",

      "abstract": "Distributed transmit beamforming is a form of cooperative communication in which two or more information sources simultaneously transmit a common message and control the phase of their transmissions so that the signals constructively combine at an intended destination. Depending on the design objectives and constraints, the power gains of distributed beamforming can be translated into dramatic increases in range, rate, or energy efficiency. Distributed beamforming may also provide benefits in terms of security and interference reduction since less transmit power is scattered in unintended directions. Key challenges in realizing these benefits, however, include coordinating the sources for information sharing and timing synchronization and, most crucially, distributed carrier synchronization so that the transmissions combine constructively at the destination. This article reviews promising recent results in architectures, algorithms, and working prototypes which indicate that these challenges can be surmounted. Directions for future research needed to translate the potential of distributed beamforming into practice are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Earthquake engineering applications is an emerging area for sensor networks where survivability is a major concern. Due to the nature of the application, it is not possible to depend on a continuously connected network. It is vital to sustain the functionality during the disconnected times that might occur following seismic activity. In addition, due to resource constraints such as data storage capacity as well as the power supply, it is important to reduce the amount of communication and data storage requirements. Data aggregation is a technique to reduce the amount of data to this end. To date, however, data aggregation for accelerogram readings has either been computationally intensive, representing a barrier to its acceptance in sensor networks, or resulted in critical data loss and inaccurate interpretations. In this article we study the application-based requirements of accelerogram-based sensor networks. We then propose a data aggregation method to enable orders of magnitude improvement in storage and transmission of the observations of a seismic activity without losing critical information. We present results from our performance analysis based on a wide variety of real earthquake data. Our results suggest orders of magnitude improvement in storage and communications with our approach.",

      "abstract": "Telecommunications services are not equally available to everyone in the world. This disparity, often called the digital divide, is the topic of much talk, but little progress has been made. Service providers in affluent regions prosper, because they can make a profit. In regions where few people are able to pay market rates, there is little, if any, service without subsidies. However, when subsidies support telecommunications service, the funds are given to existing, typically monopoly, providers, and are often misused. This article defines a concept of how subsidy funds can be directed to consumers. When implemented, this concept provides consumers with the purchasing power needed to buy services; thereby it emulates conditions in an affluent region and attracts entrepreneurs to supply services in response to demand. We believe that this will stimulate profitable business for telecommunications operators to deliver services on an ongoing basis in poor regions. First, however, funds are needed to support the process. They could be supplied by grants from major funding organizations, such as the World Bank and USAID. Long-term sustainability is proposed via contributions from existing telecommunications users through a small tax on their bills. This would ensure continuous support from within the industry with no need to apply for periodic grant renewals. While implementing these techniques is difficult, they employ principles that are already in use. This concept lends itself to a small-scale testing and demonstration, possibly through a pilot project. It fits well into the IEEE Humanitarian Technology Challenge effort by helping establish the telecommunications infrastructure in developing regions.",

      "abstract": "Critical to the success of Marconi's pioneering work on radio telegraphy was the device needed to detect the radio telegraph messages on reception. Marconi finally settled on the \"coherer.\" The invention of the device is often attributed to Oliver Lodge, a British physicist of the late 19th century. The detection properties of this device were, in fact, discovered by Edouard Branly, a French experimental physicist of the same period. As Dr. Dilhac makes clear in the following, Lodge himself attributed the signal detection properties of the coherer to Branly, coining the term coherer, and calling the device the \"Branly coherer.\" The article clearly and succinctly discusses Branly's life, and describes the circumstances around which the coherer detection property was discovered by Branly. As pointed out by Dr. Dilhac, the physics behind the coherer long eluded scientists, and is just now, hopefully, becoming understood. During his life, Branly constantly denied being the inventor of radio, claiming that as a scientist he had only discovered an effect that had permitted others, like Popov, to develop wireless transmission. On the other hand, he was one of the earliest promoters of the remote control of equipment. During a largely publicized demonstration on 30 June 1905 at Palais de Chaillot in Paris he demonstrated the possibility to remotely and wirelessly turn light bulbs on and off or activate various electromechanical apparatus including motors. He made a publication on that topic in Compte-rendus a l'Academie des Sciences de Paris in March 1905. What is today called the Branly effect refers to a set of phenomena some of which were discovered before Branly. However, Branly was undoubtedly the first to publish about the effect of a spark that is, in modern words, the effect of an electromagnetic wave. Therefore, through the coherer and the demonstration that radio waves could easily be detected over long distances, he permitted early developments in wireless telecommunications. Finally and surprisingly, because of both its own intrinsic complexity and its potential involvement in modern technology, the Branly effect is today still a subject of investigation.",

A simple and robust medium-access-control (MAC) protocol is of critical importance to utilize the large bandwidth of UWB channels and to enable numerous new applications and services cost effectively. In this article, we introduce an efficient MAC protocol design for both centralized and distributed multihop UWB networks, based on the exclusive region concept. By reserving a small ER surrounding the receivers to assure successful transmissions, the ER-based MAC protocol can exploit the spatial multiplexing gain of UWB networks and enable multiple users to efficiently and fairly share network resources.",

      "abstract": "Multiple wireless interfaces (GSM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM, and GPS receiver, etc.) are being integrated into mobile devices. WiMAX, an IEEE802.16-based wireless access technology recently included in the IMT-2000 set of standards by ITU-R, will soon be added. Obstacles remain to operating these collocated radios concurrently, including interference and hardware conflicts due to congested spectrum allocation and component sharing with radio integration. In this article we provide a tutorial overview of today's solutions to enable concurrent operation of multiple collocated radios in IEEE 802.16- based wireless networks with a focus on perceived concurrency: a MAC coordination approach. We then present three general design principles - predictability, compressibility, and flexible scheduling - with examples of standard features. It is anticipated that the next-generation IEEE 802.16 standards will be enhanced with new features such as explicit service setup, asynchronous operation, and collocated coexistence-aware scheduling.",

      "abstract": "As Ethernet traffic increases rapidly in carrier networks, service providers have an increasing need for Ethernet infrastructure networking in order to scale their Ethernet services. Ethernet infrastructure transports Ethernet traffic over distance, protects the traffic from link and nodal failures, and aggregates Ethernet connections from a large number of low-speed ports onto a much smaller number of high-speed ports. An Ethernet infrastructure allows service providers to inexpensively interconnect end user locations with one another for private line services, and to interconnect end users with the VPLS and IP/MPLS service edges for enterprise, residential, and mobility services. OAM and protection capabilities are critical to enable Ethernet to be deployed as an infrastructure technology. This article reviews several important developments in Ethernet OAM and protection standards, and discusses how those capabilities are vital for the creation of an effective Ethernet infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Femtocells have become an attractive device for operators to offer extended services on their licensed UMTS/LTE spectrum. In this article we focus on the access control strategy - a crucial aspect for operators to give preferential access to femtocells for their subscribers. The general issue of supporting femtocells in pre-Release 8 UMTS networks with pre-Release 8 UE is first outlined in order to help the reader understand the motivation behind some concepts introduced in 3GPP Release 8 to support femtocells. A description of the femtocell access control strategy for UMTS and LTE is then provided based on 3GPP Release 8 specifications. Finally, the issue of LTE physical cell identity confusion associated with inbound handover to femtocells (which is expected to be resolved within the 3GPP Release 9 timeline) is discussed.",

Then we show some field experiment results in an urban area in Tokyo to investigate and verify the radio propagation characteristics and the quality of communications by using a wireless radio prototype system.

      "abstract": "At present there is considerable interest in the use of single carrier frequency-division multiple access. This interest is justified by the inherent single carrier structure of the SC-FDMA scheme, which is more robust against phase noise and has a lower peak-to-average power ratio than orthogonal frequency-division multiple access. This consequently makes it more attractive for uplink transmission from low-cost devices with limited transmit power. SC-FDMA commonly makes use of frequency domain linear equalization in order to combat the frequency selectivity of the transmission channel. Frequency domain decision feedback equalization, composed of a frequency domain feed forward filter and a time domain feedback filter, outperforms LE due to its ability to cancel precursor echoes. Although these solutions suffer from error propagation, results show that DFE still offers a significant performance gain over conventional LE for uncoded SC-FDMA. In this article we show how precoding can be used on the uplink of the LTE standard to overcome the frequency selective nature of the radio channel. We propose a frequency domain implementation of Tomlinson- Harashima precoding and investigate the bit error rate and the PAPR performance for SCFDMA using ZF and MMSE THP.",

In a second step we derive some network and service management requirements, and discuss some of them in more detail.",

It comprises five layers where higher-layer bitstreams can be discarded without affecting the lower layersiquest decoding. The codec also has an optional core layer interoperable with ITU-T G.722.2 (3GPP AMR-WB) at 12.65 kb/s. G.718 was designed to provide high speech quality at low bit rates and to be robust to significant rates of frame erasures or packet losses.

      "abstract": "Several wired in-home networking technologies are currently available to consumers, although most of them were designed to cope with only one type of home wiring and are not interoperable with each other. In 2006 ITU-T started a standardization project called G.hn for a unified next generation networking technology, operating over all types of in-home wiring (phone line, power line, coaxial cable, and Cat-5 cable). ITU-T Recommendation G.9960, consented in December 2008, is the G.hn foundation: it specifies network architecture, most of the PHY, and some aspects of the MAC. The complete Recommendation is expected within 2009. Besides residential premises, G.hn is intended for small/home offices and public places such as multiple dwelling units, hotels, and conference rooms. This article gives an overview of G.hn technology focusing on the main principles used to build a single transmission scheme for multiple types of wires.",

Although there is no single Navy program office whose primary aim is to develop underwater telemetry systems, the Office of Naval Research has made a significant investment in both theoretical and applied work over the past twenty years and currently funds multiple programs in acoustic communication. Increased throughput, better power efficiency, low probability of detection, and compact implementations are all important research topics.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces various handover scenarios in multihop cellular networks. In addition, this article presents handover schemes where relay stations are located either inside a cell or on the boundary between two adjacent cells and investigates the effects of the deployment position of relay stations to handover performance. The simulation results show that multihop cellular networks for both deployment scenarios can achieve 90 percent throughput increase over single-hop cellular networks. The results also show that the overall throughput of the multihop cellular networks with relay stations inside a cell is higher than for those with relay stations on the boundary between two adjacent cells, whereas the opposite is observed for the throughput of cell-boundary users. The intercell handover latency in multihop cellular networks is increased by 20 ~ 56 percent compared with that in single-hop cellular networks because of the increased number of handovers and signaling overhead. However, by deploying relay stations on the boundary between two adjacent cells, the service-interruption time caused by inter-cell handover is reduced by 80 percent compared with that of single-hop cellular networks.",

In this article, a parallel processing technique is presented for time-driven simulations of large and complex wireless networks. The technique explicitly considers the physical-layer details of wireless network simulators such as shadowing and co-channel interference. The technique uses multiple processors interconnected with highspeed links. Principles and issues are elaborated, including workload partitioning, synchronization, and database design. Numerical results from two different wireless network simulators employing the technique are presented to demonstrate the performance of the technique. The results indicate that the technique can significantly improve the run-time performance of time-driven simulations of large and complicated wireless networks of different types.",

In this article we review the body-coupled communications technology, which we show to be a viable basis for future BANs. In BCC, the human body is used as a signal propagation medium, which provides a key benefit - the communication is centered around the user and limited to his or her close proximity, that is, this technology provides human-centric connectivity. This enables unique applications that are illustrated in this work. Moreover, we outline the fundamental properties of the BCC technology and provide different trade-offs and challenges for modulation and protocol design. This article also discusses the outlook for BCC and suggests a number of important research topics.",

In this article a hybrid wireless-broadband over power lines network, suitable for rural and remote areas is presented, offering smart grid applications and broadband access along a 107 km medium voltage power grid in Larissa, a rural area in central Greece. This hybrid solution exploits the ubiquitous presence of the power grid along with the adaptability and accessibility of wireless technology. Through the design and implementation of this hybrid network many aspects of BPL technology were successfully dealt with demonstrating that, in addition to enhancing the power grid performance, W-BPL technology may be considered as an alternative broadband solution in rural and/or sparsely populated areas.",

      "abstract": "Providing users of multi-interface devices the ability to roam between different access networks is becoming a key requirement for service providers. The availability of multiple mobile broadband access technologies, together with the increasing use of real-time multimedia applications, is creating strong demand for handover solutions that can seamlessly and securely transition user sessions across different access technologies. A key challenge to meeting this growing demand is to ensure handover performance, measured in terms of latency and loss. In addition, handover solutions must allow service providers, application providers, and other entities to implement handover policies based on a variety of operational and business requirements. Therefore, standards are required that can facilitate seamless handover between such heterogeneous access networks and that can work with multiple mobility management mechanisms. The IEEE 802.21 standard addresses this problem space by providing a media-independent framework and associated services to enable seamless handover between heterogeneous access technologies. In this article, we discuss how the IEEE 802.21 standard framework and services are addressing the challenges of seamless mobility for multi-interface devices. In addition, we describe and discuss design considerations for a proof-of-concept IEEE 802.21 implementation and share practical insights into how this standard can optimize handover performance.",

This article surveys trends in the underlying technologies, extrapolating out to the 2015 timeframe, and drawing on the developments in standardization for IPTV, cable networks, and the IP NGN. These evolution trends lead to the notion of a medianet as a useful way to think of all of the enabling video and multimedia technologies. A medianet is essentially an IP network that is optimized to deliver video services to any or multiple display devices, and uses any of optical, cable, wireline, and wireless networks for this purpose.",

The most important feature of this codec is that the G.711.1 bitstream can be transcoded into a G.711 bitstream by simple truncation. G.711.1 operates at 64, 80, and 96 kb/s, and is designed to achieve very short delay and low complexity. ITU-T evaluation results show that the codec fulfils all the requirements defined in the terms of reference. This article presents the codec requirements and design constraints, describes how standardization was conducted, and reports on the codec performance and its initial deployment.",

The motivation for the standardization work was to meet the new challenges of VoIP in terms of quality of service and efficiency in networks, in particular regarding the strategic rollout of wideband service. G.729.1 was designed to allow smooth transition from narrowband (300-3400 Hz) PSTN to high-quality wideband (50-7000 Hz) telephony by preserving backward compatibility with the widely deployed G.729 codec. The scalable structure allows gradual quality increase with bit rate. A low-delay mode makes the coder especially suitable for high-quality speech communication. The article presents the standardization goals and process, an overview of the coding algorithm, and the codec performance in various conditions.",

      "abstract": "In the last 15 years, numerous investigations by both academia and industry have been carried out in the field of all-optical WDM networks' design. In all-optical - or transparent - WDM networks, data is transmitted from its source to its destination in optical form, switching/routing operations being performed in the optical domain without undergoing any optical-to-electrical conversion. Optical transparency may considerably reduce network infrastructures' cost and extend the range of services offered by the carriers. Designing an all-optical network consists of assigning to each traffic demand an endto- end optical circuit, also called \"lightpath.\" In such networks, the problem of routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) aims to find an adequate route and an adequate wavelength for each traffic demand subject to the wavelength continuity constraint and limited network resources. The feasibility of the obtained lightpaths in terms of admissible quality of transmission (QoT) presents another difficulty. Indeed, according to the state of technology, various physical impairments degrade the quality of the optical signal along its propagation. Optical fibers and optical amplifiers as well as optical switching/routing nodes impact on end-to-end QoT. In this context only translucent networks are achievable, for instance, at a pan-European or pan-American scale. A translucent network uses electrical regenerators at intermediate nodes only when it is necessary to improve the signal budget. The cost of a network is roughly proportional to average number of input/output ports of a node. Knowing that today an optical port is five times less expensive than an electrical one, sparse regeneration allows translucent WDM networks to meet the QoT requirements and achieve performance measures close to those obtained by fully opaque networks at much lower cost. In this article we propose a state of the art in the field of impairment-aware RWA (IA-RWA), starting from the case of predictable traffic demands to the open problem of stochastic traffic demands. An economic analysis of the IA-RWA problem is proposed to justify the concept of translucent networks. The case of multi-domain lightpath establishment is also considered. Several examples of still open problems are mentioned in the article. Most of the concepts and results presented in this article refer to the FP7 DICONET European project in which the authors are involved.",

      "abstract": "Recent mobile devices are integrated with multiple network interfaces. Users want their devices connected to the network anytime anywhere. It is highly feasible for a user to change connection to another network for users that leave the service area of its current serving network, where handover needs to be executed seamlessly such that ongoing service sessions are not interrupted. The handover operation not only requires switching the interfaces within a device but also involves seamless reconfiguration of the supporting networks. In this article, an improved IP-based vertical handover technology for mobile WiMAX , 3GPP legacy systems (i.e., Global System for Mobile communications and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), and 3G Long Term Evolution is presented, which is based on existing optimized handover techniques between mobile WiMAX and 3GPP accesses. Formerly proposed 3GPP WiMAX optimized VHO solutions introduced new elements, such as the forward attachment function and access network discovery and selection function. The ANDSF supports the discovery of target access, and the FAF provides the functionality that authenticates the UE before the execution of VHO. However, the previous technique has limitations that result in data loss and abnormal disconnection to the source access. This article provides a solution by introducing an additional network element called the data forwarding function (DFF) that eliminates the data loss during VHO execution. In addition, the DFF resolves the problem of abrupt disconnection to the source network. The simulation results show that the proposed VHO technique is effective in minimizing data loss during VHO execution between mobile WiMAX and 3GPP networks. As the proposed solution of this article is an IP based handover solution, it can be similarly applied to other communication networks.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the early pioneering work of both telephone and radio engineers in effecting improvements in the noise performance of communication systems. This work led ultimately to the explosive growth of communication activities following World War II. Radio engineers during the 1920s were most concerned with reducing the impact of externally generated \"static,\" and showed this could be accomplished by the use of directional antennas and moving to higher-frequency transmission. Telephone engineers during that period of time, most prominently John R. Carson of AT&amp;T, were led to include the impact of \"fluctuation noise\" (shot and thermal noise) as well. Carson, using the then novel concept of noise frequency spectrum, showed how the appropriate choice of bandwidth and frequency of transmission could be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, anticipating the concept of a \"matched filter\" introduced 20 years later during radar developments of World War II. This early work on improving the noise performance of communication systems led, in the early 1930s, to Edwin H. Armstrong's spectacular leap ahead with his invention of wide-deviation low-noise frequency modulation (FM), followed a few years later by the invention by Alec Reeves of pulse code modulation (PCM), the first low-noise digital communication system of the modern era.",

Viable approaches include the use of power control, opportunistic spectrum access, intra and inter-base station interference cancellation, adaptive fractional frequency reuse, spatial antenna techniques such as MIMO and SDMA, and adaptive beamforming, as well as recent innovations in decoding algorithms. The applicability, complexity, and performance gains possible with each of these techniques based on simulations and empirical measurements will be highlighted for specific cellular topologies relevant to LTE macro, pico, and femto deployments for both standalone and overlay networks.",

      "abstract": "Femtocells are low-power cellular base stations that operate in licensed spectrum. They are typically deployed indoors to improve coverage and provide excellent user experience, including high data rates. Cellular operators benefit from reduced infrastructure and operational expenses for capacity upgrades and coverage improvements. Femtocells also bring unique challenges, such as unplanned deployment, user installation, restricted access, and interoperability with existing handsets and network infrastructure. Although femtocells may cause some interference to other users in the network, with the use of proper interference management techniques, this can be well controlled. We present interference management techniques for both downlink and uplink of femtocells operating based on 3GPP Release 7 standards (also known as HSPA+). Femtocell carrier selection and femtocell DL Tx power self-calibration are proposed as key interference management methods for downlink. For uplink interference management, adaptive attenuation at the femtocell and limiting the Tx power of the femtocell users are proposed. Different interference models and their analysis are presented. In addition, coverage performance and capacity results are presented to quantify the benefits of femtocells. We demonstrate that in addition to coverage enhancements, significant capacity improvements are achieved on both downlink and uplink when femtocells are deployed in 3G UMTS/HSPA+ networks.",

In this article we describe a practical approach using space-frequency-selective multiuser MIMO scheduling. Frequency-selective feedback is provided on achievable data rates for preferred single- and multistream transmission modes. The base station selects the best mode while providing instantaneous fairness. We observe that multiuser transmission increases the probability of using multistream transmission. Besides the benefits from optimal combining at the physical layer, there is an additional gain at the MAC layer since the estimation of achievable rates becomes more precise. Altogether, 93 percent of the theoretical throughput can be realized by synchronizing the base stations and providing cell-specific reference signals. We have implemented essential functions of the approach in real time on an experimental 3GPP LTE prototype in 20 MHz bandwidth. Feasibility of the key features is proven in laboratory and field trials.",

A number of technical innovations have been included in DVB-T2 to boost throughput and ruggedness, enhance single-frequency network coverage, and ease both transmitter and receiver implementation. This article starts from the motivations that led the DVB project to create the new standard and then surveys the key technologies behind DVB-T2, including the LDPC/BCH forward error correction scheme, transmission scheduling, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with huge block size, multiple-antenna transmissions, and synchronization techniques. A comparison with the current DVB-T standard is also provided, showing that DVB-T2 is able to increase the payload throughput and allows HDTV transmission with current network planning.",

      "abstract": "At present, no existing market mechanism allows for the trading of radio spectrum between licensed and unlicensed uses. Whenever spectrum is made available for reallocation, the FCC faces a dilemma in determining which access regime to use. For example, the television white spaces are largely unused and available for reallocation. Since both licensed and unlicensed allocations are valuable, allocation decisions (for the TV white spaces or any new band of radio spectrum) must be based on a clear understanding of the trade-offs between the two choices. This article defines economic criteria that can be used in making these important decisions. Economic criteria can go beyond the simple measures of profit and consumer surplus from market transactions. Although some measures of benefit, such as the value of innovation, may be difficult to quantify, the analytic economic framework presented here can easily incorporate them. This analysis does not address any noneconomic considerations in choosing between licensed and unlicensed uses. As one example, the issue of potential societal benefits from promoting minority ownership of spectrum through restricted licenses - something only possible in a licensed regime - is not addressed in this economic analysis. The analysis herein provides the economic information needed for policy analysis; it need not be the sum total of that policy analysis. Standard economic theory tells us that the value of an additional unit of spectrum is equal to the increase in socially beneficial services it produces. For licensed spectrum allowed to trade in markets, this value is relatively easy to calculate: It is the price firms pay for the licensed spectrum. The equation is more complex, however, when unlicensed spectrum is involved. The current value of unlicensed spectrum bands is equal to the sum of the value of the spectrum in all uses in those bands. The incremental value of additional spectrum allocated to unlicensed uses, however, is based on the relief to congestion the additional spectrum will provide. Unlicensed spectrum also contains a value associated with the possibility of future innovation made available by the lower transaction .costs of gaining access to unlicensed spectrum. This option value increases with additional allocations of unlicensed spectrum, leading to the benefit of incremental option value from additional unlicensed spectrum. The formula for the benefits from additional unlicensed spectrum allocations can be summarized as \"congestion alleviation plus incremental option value.\" I apply the analysis developed in this article to the case of TV white spaces. I use information from the recent auction of the lower 700 MHz band E block to calculate the incremental value of licensing the white spaces. I also calibrate an estimate of the incremental value of the white spaces under an unlicensed allocation. Initial calibration of the economic criteria that determine the trade-off between incremental licensed and unlicensed spectrum allocations indicates that currently licensing incremental allocations is the favored policy. If policy makers choose to allocate incremental spectrum as unlicensed, they should recognize the economic costs of that choice.",

      "abstract": "The instability of wireless channels was a haunting issue in communications until recent exploration in utilizing variation. The same transmission might present significantly, and usually independently, different reception quality when broadcast to receivers at different locations. In addition, the same stationary receiver might experience drastic fluctuation over time as well. The combination of link-quality variation with the broadcasting nature of the wireless channel itself disclosed a direction in the research of wireless networking, namely, the utilization of diversity. In this article, we summarize the causes of channel diversity in wireless communications, and how it is perceived in different layers of multihop wireless networks. To promote new research innovations in this area, we concentrate on link-layer diversity and speculate on the challenges and potential of diversity schemes at the network layer.",

      "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks are collections of mobile nodes that can dynamically form temporary networks without the need for pre-existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. These nodes can be arbitrarily located and can move freely at any given time. Hence, the network topology can change rapidly and unpredictably. Because wireless link capacities are usually limited, congestion is possible in MANETs. Hence, balancing the load in a MANET is important since nodes with high loads will deplete their batteries quickly, thereby increasing the probability of disconnecting or partitioning the network. This article discusses the various load metrics and summarizes the principles behind several existing load balanced ad hoc routing protocols. Finally, a qualitative comparison of the various load metrics and load balanced routing protocols is presented.",

There are two primary use cases: newer applications such as navigation, tracking of assets and personnel, and Points of Interest lookup, and emergency services (e.g., E911), where the user's location is reported to the public safety answering point from which emergency responders are dispatched. Within this space of applications, location accuracies ranging from less than 5 m to hundreds of meters may be acceptable, depending on the specific use case.

      "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems are targeted to improve the traffic safety and driving experience of passengers. Vehicular ad hoc networks are wireless communication networks proposed to be used as parts of ITS. VANETs facilitate communication among vehicles, and between vehicles and roadside equipment. A key challenge in developing such systems is to design routing and MAC protocols that not only provide good end-to-end packet delay but can also quickly adapt to changes in the network topology due to vehicular mobility. In this article we outline a new framework for location- and delay-aware cross-layer communication that addresses these challenges. Our framework provides an efficient V2I data delivery system that relays packets over low-delay paths to a fixed base station or access point. Furthermore, an instance of this framework is also presented as a protocol. Our preliminary evaluations show that our design approach is promising, and provides delay predictability, fairness, and a good packet delivery ratio.",

      "abstract": "The characteristics of Latin American network infrastructures have global consequences, particularly in the area of interdomain traffic engineering. As an example, Latin America shows the largest de-aggregation factor of IP prefixes among all regional Internet registries, being proportionally the largest contributor to the growth and dynamics of the global BGP routing table. In this article we analyze the peculiarities of LA interdomain routing architecture, and provide up-to-date data about the combined effects of the multihoming and TE practices in the region. We observe that the Internet Research Task Force initiative on the separation of the address space into locators and identifiers can not only alleviate the growth and dynamics of the global routing table, but can also offer appealing TE opportunities for LA. We outline one of the solutions under discussion at the IRTF, the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol, and examine its potential in terms of interdomain traffic management in the context of LA. The key advantage of LISP is its nondisruptive nature, but the existing proposals for its control plane have some problems that may hinder its possible deployment. In light of this, we introduce a promising control plane for LISP that can solve these issues, and at the same time has the potential to bridge the gap between intradomain and interdomain traffic management.",

They are subject to limited communication conditions when compared with nodes specifically designed to this context. Existing works either consider antennas installed on top of the vehicle roof or nodes that operate in infrastructure mode. In this article, we investigate through real experiments the characteristics of links formed by in-car nodes running off-the-shelf wireless technologies such as IEEE 802.11(a/g) in ad hoc mode. We surprisingly observe that in-car nodes do show enough performance in terms of network capacity to be used in a number of applications, such as file transfer in peer-to-peer applications. Nonetheless, we identify some key performance issues and devise a number of configuration recommendations and future work directions.",

      "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networking of dismounted combat personnel is expected to play an important role in the future of network-centric operations. High-speed, short-range, soldier-to-soldier wireless communications will be required to relay information on situational awareness, tactical instructions, and covert surveillance related data during special operations reconnaissance and other missions. This article presents some of the work commissioned by the U.K. Ministry of Defence to assess the feasibility of using 60 GHz millimeter-wave smart antenna technology to provide covert communications capable of meeting these stringent networking needs. Recent advances in RF front-end technology, alongside physical layer transmission schemes that could be employed in millimeter-wave soldier- mounted radio, are discussed. The introduction of covert communications between soldiers will require the development of a bespoke directive medium access layer. A number of adjustments to the IEEE 802.11 distribution coordination function that will enable directional communications are suggested. The successful implementation of future smart antenna technologies and direction of arrival-based protocols will be highly dependent on thorough knowledge of transmission channel characteristics prior to deployment. A novel approach to simulating dynamic soldier-to-soldier signal propagation using state-of-the-art animation-based technology developed for computer game design is described, and important channel metrics such as root mean square angle and delay spread for a team of four networked infantry soldiers over a range of indoor and outdoor environments is reported.",

      "abstract": "Services that were traditionally designed for a static environment can now be implemented into mobile devices. At the same time, services with traditionally passive-consumption-oriented paradigms are moving toward participative and interactive services. One such service is mobile and interactive social TV (MIST), which allows geographically dispersed people to meet in a virtual shared space and watch TV while being able to interact with each other. This service allows users to create an experience of watching together by providing its participants a common shared context. We present two novel architectures of a MIST system. In both of the architectures, the interaction is represented by rich audio-visual media, allowing users to hear and see each other. In the first architecture, the mixing of the TV content with the interaction media is performed at the server side. In the second architecture, the mixing is performed in each client device. There are many questions that arise from the consumer perspective regarding a radical change in experience when compared to traditional laid-back TV watching. Mobile and interactive social TV is relatively new when compared to the concept of traditional TV watching in a static context. To develop understanding of the consumer experience with the MIST concept, a focus group study approach was conducted. The study revealed that the feeling of social presence of people of interest when watching content with them was considered to add value to the viewing experience. The key system requirement is the ability for selective enabling/disabling of individual interaction features as per the user preferences and context. The context was considered to be influenced by both the relation with other participants and the content being consumed.",

Standards such as DVB-T and analog television broadcast are pervasive worldwide, and their use in mobile applications circumvents many of the deployment challenges facing DVB-H and the like. However, there are severe technical challenges in doing so: mobility, power consumption, antenna performance, and mixer harmonic rejection are just a few of the issues facing the use of free-to-air broadcast in mobile devices. In this article we address these issues, with particular focus on DVB-T digital and NTSC/PAL/SECAM analog broadcast standards.",

Based on the developed model, characteristics of global traffic patterns in urban areas are studied. Our results show that different control mechanisms used at intersections such as cycle duration, green split, and coordination of traffic lights have a significant effect on intervehicle spacing distribution and traffic dynamics. These findings provide important insights into the network connectivity behavior of urban traffic, which are essential for designing appropriate routing protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks in urban scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Modeling and simulation is essential for performance evaluation of wireless systems and specific algorithms used, for instance, during resource allocation. For current and future wireless systems, several properties have to be considered such as data traffic, frequency selective fading channels, and radio resource management. Throughout this article, a new system-level simulator concept is presented for packet switched systems using OFDMA, which is called snapshot-based SLS and represents a compromise between state-of-the-art static and dynamic SLSs. The proposed methodology only considers short time intervals within the busy hour by their statistics so that RRM and data traffic can be considered, as in dynamic SLS, but with lower computational complexity. In this article a description is given of how the cellular setup and traffic generation are performed for the proposed snapshot concept. Furthermore, a new methodology is proposed for a quality measure of resource units that is applicable to future wireless systems using an interleaved subcarrier allocation. Exemplary simulation results show that the developed concept is able to evaluate the performance of OFDMA systems considering the impact of, for example, data traffic and resource allocation strategies.",

This capability enables low-cost delivery of large volumes of popular contents (e.g., for video/audio streaming and file sharing) in a mobile network. The MCBCS framework in WiMAX allows multicast/broadcast of data in a radio channel that is time shared with unicast services. In a single-frequency network, where MCBCS transmissions are synchronized or coordinated across BSs in the designated service area, the mobile stations can use macro-space diversity to improve achievable data rates and also maintain service continuity and power saving across cells with minimal interaction with the network.",

Power lines offer a convenient and pervasive communication medium that does not require new cable installation. However, power lines are classified as a noisy and unpredictable communication channel. Advanced signal processing techniques, such as wavelet filter banks and multirate systems, can be utilized to improve the quality of communication over power lines. In this article an overview of the diverse applications of wavelet filter banks in power line communications is presented with particular reference to wavelet-based multicarrier modulation techniques. Moreover, some suggestions are given regarding the future applications of multirate signal processing techniques in PLC.",

      "abstract": "Integration and full interoperability are challenging areas of research in wide area networks today. A European project, MUPBED, has recently concluded and achieved the main result of integrating and demonstrating technologies and network solutions that enable the operation of future European research infrastructures capable of supporting advanced applications. The achieved results are largely valid for any multidomain network scenario. The test network set up by the project is a prototype multidomain optical network able to provide connectivity on demand services across multiple domains directly driven by the applications. Rather than implementing ex novo a unified control plane and replacing existing equipment, the project approach has been to enable seamless interworking of different control planes by means of ASON/GMPLS and standardized network interfaces. This was done in accomplishment of the project target, which was to test and trial a common migration path toward the future European research network that should be followed by national research and education network operators, together with commercial operators. This article describes the main aspects of the MUPBED experience, which by its own peculiar nature provides deep insight into the most recent evolution of control-plane-enabled optical networking toward multidomain integration. Topics covered by the project and briefly related here include network architecture, applications, protocol and control software development, standardization issues, design, analysis and simulation, testing, measurement, and monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Near-field communications (NFC) promises to create a whole new paradigm for the vast majority of cell phone users and is emerging as a near-term reality. What has been described as the confluence of RFID and cellular telephony will bring with it a wealth of new applications. The applications space, security mechanisms, and human interface are maturing; the service providers and payment companies are working to keep pace with these new capabilities; and it is starting to be incorporated into the new generation of cell phone designs. With NFC, our favorite electronic companion essentially becomes our magic wand. The basic \"wand\" premise is that it indicates intent. When you point, where you point, or at whom you point, tells the machine piece of the human-machine interface much about what it is supposed to do.",

Our architecture enables conventional terminals without mobility support to obtain connectivity either from fixed locations or mobile platforms (e.g., vehicles) and move between them, while keeping their ongoing sessions. This functionality offers broadband Internet access in automotive scenarios such as public transportation systems, where users spend time both in vehicles and at stations. The key advantage of our proposal, as compared with current alternatives, is that the described mobile functionality is provided to conventional IP devices that lack mobility functionality. We also performed an experimental evaluation of our proposal that shows that our architecture improves the quality perceived by the end users.",

      "abstract": "A key aspect of the 3GPP system architecture evolution is the specification of an evolved packet core that supports multiple access networks. The EPC enables operators to deploy and operate one common packet core network for 3GPP radio accesses (E-UTRAN, UTRAN, and GERAN), as well as other wireless and wireline access networks (e.g., eHRPD, WLAN, WIMAX, and DSL/Cable), providing the operator with a common set of services and capabilities across the networks. A key requirement of the EPC is to provide seamless mobility at the IP layer as the user moves within and between accesses. This article provides an overview of the EPC specifications that use a network-based mobility mechanism based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 to enable mobility between access networks. An important facet of providing seamless mobility for a user's sessions across technologies is to ensure that quality of service is maintained as the user moves between accesses. An overview of the \"off-path\" QoS model to supplement PMIPv6 is also provided.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative communications fundamentally changes the abstraction of a wireless link and offers significant potential advantages for wireless networks. However, such technologies are evaluated with idealized scenarios where many control costs are assumed to be negligible. Moreover, even if these costs appear small in simple network scenarios, they increase significantly with the size and traffic level of the network, requiring careful evaluation, or even innovative design, of cooperative protocols to ensure their usefulness in realistic networks. This article describes a realistic evaluation of cooperative communications in a networking context. Insights obtained from this evaluation help guide work on cooperative communications toward practical and potentially beneficial protocols.",

To reduce the upgrading cost, NGA1 conforms to the standardized GPON and the deployed optical distribution network. This article presents the investigation of five candidate NGA1 architectures from the perspective of the MAC-layer bandwidth allocation including the analysis of the traffic characteristics of the subscribers' applications and the criteria in mapping them into proper transmission containers. Extensive simulations were conducted to investigate and compare the performances of the five candidate NGA1 architectures.",

However, the deployment of a new femtocell layer may have an undesired impact on the performance of the macrocell layer. The allocation of spectrum resources and the avoidance of electromagnetic interference are some of the more urgent challenges that operators face before femtocells become widely deployed. In this article a coverage and interference analysis based on a realistic OFDMA macro/femtocell scenario is provided, as well as some guidelines on how the spectrum allocation and interference mitigation problems can be approached in these networks. Special attention is paid to the use of self-configuration and self-optimization techniques for the avoidance of interference.",

      "abstract": "India, home to 1.2 billion people with a GDP growth of 9 percent, has been experiencing flat to modest growth of broadband services in the past decade despite the fact that the country continues to add 8-10 million cellular connections per month. In this article, we examine the reasons that affect the high cost of broadband in India and the steps required to reduce the cost. We also argue that the usage-based pricing model, which is used widely for billing retail customers, is hampering the growth of local content and services. In contrast, a flat-rate pricing model would spur demand for broadband services and enable content providers to target the local and emerging market. We study the Indian telecommunication scenario from a pricing and technology perspective to understand what the driving forces are for business to prosper. We then discuss the Indian landscape from a metro/access/core networks perspective. The technology choices and the methods of deployment are considered followed by an analysis of the service-centric model adopted by providers.",

The public is demanding open standards. The rallying cry \"open standards\" means different things to different groups. This article reviews the different needs of specific groups of society and develops ten different requirements for open standards. To implement these requirements, changes to the rules and procedures of standardization organizations, international bodies (e.g., WIPO, WTO), and national patent office rules are proposed. Interestingly, technical changes, in the form of new standardized protocols, rather than legal or policy changes, appear to be the most important changes to meet the requirements of open standards.",

The SCA is a product of the American military's SDR acquisition program and has played a large role in SDR development in the military and in the wireless industry. OSSIE was designed for use in wireless communications curricula and research efforts, so it is easy to learn and illustrative of software engineering, programming, and communications engineering concepts important in industrial practice today. OSSIE includes a core framework (i.e., common services enumerated in the SCA). It also includes graphical user interface-oriented tools that are easily learned and free to download and use. The tools auto-generate SCA-specific component source code and supporting files, leaving the developer to provide signal processing functionality. In addition, visualization tools for debugging and a growing library of SDR software components are available. Discussed herein are examples of SDRs designed using OSSIE, including embedded applications. OSSIE enables easy transition from concepts to practice in SDR design for communications engineers who may not have a strong software background.",

With opportunistic routing, intermediate nodes collaborate on packet forwarding in a localized and consistent manner. Opportunistic routing greatly increases transmission reliability and network throughput by taking advantage of the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. In this article we first illustrate the basic idea behind opportunistic routing, and then categorize current research work based on different criteria. We illustrate how different protocols work, and discuss their merits and drawbacks. Finally, we point out potential issues and future directions in opportunistic routing for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks.",

      "abstract": "Underwater wireless communications can enable many scientific, environmental, commercial, safety, and military applications. Wireless signal transmission is also crucial to remotely control instruments in ocean observatories and to enable coordination of swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots, which will play the role of mobile nodes in future ocean observation networks by virtue of their flexibility and reconfigurability. To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel - such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading - require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops. In this article, we provide an overview of recent medium access control, routing, transport, and cross-layer networking protocols.",

      "abstract": "Signal processing and coding technology for digital magnetic recording is the core technology of the channel electronics module in a hard disk drive (HDD) that processes signals read from magnetic media. In this historical review I focus on what is now widely known as partial-response, maximum-likelihood (PRML) technology, which takes advantage of the inherent redundancy that exists in signals read out of magnetic media; its theoretical foundation goes back to 1970, and it capitalizes on the analogy between high-speed data transmission and high-density digital recording, and that between a convolutional code and a partial-response signal. The first PRML-based product was introduced by IBM in 1990, and PRML technology soon became the industry standard for all digital magnetic recording products, ranging from computers' HDDs and tape drives to micro hard discs used in PCs, mobile phones, and MP3 players; use of the PRML principle has recently been extended to optical recording products such as CDs and DVDs. Its improved version, called NPML (noise-predictive, maximum-likelihood), and variants have been adopted by the HDD industry since 2000. Today, a large number of communication and information theory researchers are investigating use of advanced techniques such as turbo coding/decoding to further improve the density and reliability of both magnetic and optical recording systems.",

The recently adopted IEEE draft standards for 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet single-mode fiber local area network applications will change this situation. Although first generation implementations will use discrete components based on existing technologies, long-term requirements for significant reduction in cost, size, and power of 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s transceivers will lead to a broad demand for photonic integration. Both hybrid planar lightguide circuit and monolithic photonic integrated circuit are feasible approaches that meet the requirements of the new IEEE standards.",

Among the many different solutions for the home network, we review in this article the use of polymer optical fibers for short-reach and high-capacity optical communications for residential customer premises. POF is an easy-to-install, low-cost, and eye-safe solution for these networks, with the potential of being future-proof. In this article the state of the art in POF technology is presented by summarizing significant results achieved in the European project POF-ALL. Data transmission rates of more than 1 Gb/s over 50+ m and 100 Mb/s over 200+ m of standard step-index POF have been shown.",

Significant expansions in capability, in conjunction with market demands for compactness, reasonable price and longer battery life, place substantial pressure on handset component technologies. To achieve these mutually conflicting goals with available implementation technologies, specialized design skills are necessary for power saving, chip-to-chip interface and subsystem integration in mobile phone chipsets. The inter-related design and verification issues are discussed with lessons learned from our professional experiences in designing third-generation cellular modems, mobile digital TV, and mobile WiMax system-on-a-chip development.",

With a focus on achieving high accuracy in the real network environments, key features introduced in the new version of the standard and the exact causes and practical handling of time errors are discussed. A prototype Gigabit Ethernet switch based on a model of a combined ordinary clock and a peer-to-peer transparent clock is described to demonstrate how design decisions have been made on the overall architecture and on the functions of building blocks. Because the popularly used synchronization schemes used in legacy TDM network or based on GPS technology have high capital and operating expenses, network operators are searching for a better solution. Recently, IEEE 1588-2008 has been developed to meet the new synchronization requirements in various applications, including telecommunications backhaul networks; this article discusses the meticulous considerations for implementing IEEE 1588-based systems that are robust, cost-effective, and precise in solving the shared synchronized time problem.",

      "abstract": "We describe an emerging method of encryption suitable for high-speed optical communication networks. This encryption protocol combines traditional electronic cryptographic algorithms with the physical effect of optical noise of quantum origin to create a highly secure method of secret communications. The resulting optical signal is compatible with today's high speed fiber optic infrastructure including optical amplification and add/drop multiplexing. Systems implementing this protocol can be constructed with common commercially available components. We describe experimental results obtained with a 2.5 Gb/s system. The encrypted signal is shown to travel error-free through &gt;500 km of optical fiber. Simulations show that reaches and data rates consistent with modern long haul optical networks are attainable.",

Sophisticated multiantenna techniques can be employed to meet these objectives; in particular, multi-antenna precoding (or beamforming) methods are promising solutions. However, due to the strict power regulations placed on UWB transmissions, conventional precoding techniques are not always suitable for use in UWB networks. In this article we present new theoretical results and practical approaches to performing precoding in OFDM-based multi-antenna UWB systems.",

However, before DSA approaches can be enabled, it is important that we understand the dynamics of spectrum usage in licensed bands. Our focus in this article is the cellular band. Using a unique dataset collected inside a cellular network operator, we analyze the usage in cellular bands and discuss the implications of our results on enabling DSA in these bands. One of the key aspects of our dataset is its scale-it consists of data collected over three weeks at hundreds of base stations. We dissect this data along different dimensions to characterize if and when spectrum is available, develop models of primary usage, and understand the implications of these results on DSA techniques such as sensing.",

The adoption of DSA technologies by the public-safety community can better align systems with the future of wireless services, in general, and can contribute to making next-generation public-safety radio systems more robust, capable, and flexible. A critical first step toward a DSA-enabled future is to reform spectrum management to create spectrum pools that DSA-enabled devices, such as cognitive radios, can use iquest under the control of more dynamically flexible and adaptive prioritization policies than is possible with legacy technology. Appropriate reform will enable spectrum portability, facilitating the decoupling of spectrum rights from the provision of infrastructure. This article examines the economic, policy, and market challenges of enabling spectrum pooling and portability for public-safety radios.",

      "abstract": "In this article we describe the QoS concept of the evolved packet system, which was standardized in 3GPP Release 8. The concept provides access network operators and service operators with a set of tools to enable service and subscriber differentiation. Such tools are becoming increasingly important as operators are moving from a single to a multi-service offering at the same time as both the number of mobile broadband subscribers and the traffic volume per subscriber is rapidly increasing. The \"bearer\" is a central element of the EPS QoS concept and is the level of granularity for bearer-level QoS control. The network-initiated QoS control paradigm specified in EPS is a set of signaling procedures for managing bearers and controlling their QoS assigned by the network. The EPS QoS concept is class-based, where each bearer is assigned one and only one QoS class identifier by the network. The QCI is a scalar that is used within the access network as a reference to node-specific parameters that control packet forwarding treatment. This class-based approach, together with the network-initiated QoS control paradigm, gives network operators full control over the QoS provided for its offered services for each of its subscriber groups.",

The specification requirements for IEEE 802.15.4-compliant transceivers, and the design challenges and practical implementation of a highly-integrated low-power 2.4 GHz transceiver are subsequently discussed. The transceiver uses a direct-conversion receiver with switched antenna diversity and a transmitter using direct closedloop VCO modulation. It integrates a mask-programmable radio controller capable of autonomously performing timing-critical MAC functions, and a sleep timer. Implemented in 0.18 mum RFCMOS technology with a chip area of less than 6 mm<sup>2</sup>, the transceiver achieves a link margin of 99 dB while drawing 16.8 mA and 18 mA from a 1.8 V supply in receive and transmit mode, respectively.",

      "abstract": "In this article we review an important class of wireless cooperation protocols known as amplify-and-forward relaying. One or more low-complexity relay nodes assist the communication between sources and destinations without having to decode the signal. This makes AF relaying transparent to modulation and coding of the source/destination communication protocol. It is therefore a highly flexible technology that also qualifies for application in heterogeneous networks comprising many nodes of different complexity or even standards. Recently, two-way relaying was introduced, which is readily combined with AF relaying. It is a spectrally efficient protocol that allows for bidirectional communication between sources and destinations. In order to investigate the potential of wireless AF relaying, we introduce three distributed network scenarios that differ in the amount of cooperation between nodes. New challenges arise in those networks, and we discuss approaches to overcome them. For the most general case of a completely distributed system, we present coherent relaying solutions that offer a distributed spatial multiplexing gain even for single-antenna nodes. Based on real-world experiments, we validate the feasibility of all schemes in our laboratory.",

This article first introduces and compares different relay types in LTE-Advanced and WiMAX standards. Simulation results show that relay technologies can effectively improve service coverage and system throughput. Three relay transmission schemes are then summarized and evaluated in terms of transmission efficiency under different radio channel conditions. Finally, a centralized pairing scheme and a distributed pairing scheme are developed for effective relay selection.

      "abstract": "As recounted in the paper by Irwin Dorros following, the divestiture of AT&amp;T went officially into effect January 1, 1984, 25 years ago. This momentous event irreversibly changed the state of telecommunications in the United States, and, in the years following, throughout the world, as country after country privatized their previously government-owned telecommunication systems. This year of 2009 therefore offers us the opportunity to look back and see what has happened to our field as a result. We are fortunate to have the views of Irwin Dorros on this occasion, since he was a key AT&amp;T executive charged with working out, and helping to resolve, the complex issues of divestiture, both during the negotiations between AT&amp;T and the U.S. government, and in the period following the agreement of divestiture. He describes the nature of the telecommunications industry prior to divestiture and the factors leading to the divestiture agreement. He also provides his own views on the communications industry after divestiture. He pulls no punches in his candid remarks, indicating where AT&amp;T, in his opinion, which had been in the forefront of much of the worldwide innovation in voice telephony, fell behind in the broad area of computer communications. We commend this article to your attention.",

      "abstract": "Mobile satellite services are attracting renewed attention stemming from the FCC ancillary terrestrial component ruling that allows satellite spectrum to be used for integrated terrestrial services in the footprint of the satellite. This attention is focused on the development of dual-mode satellite-terrestrial devices to facilitate hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks intended by the ATC order. The satellite component in these dual-mode devices is best adapted from the air interface chosen for the ATC to optimize form factor, especially for small hand-held devices, mobility management, power efficiency, and a common core network functionality. With the advent of WiMAX as a viable 4G technology, satellite adaptation of WiMAX has been considered for the satellite services coupled with WiMAX ATC. The main considerations for satellite adaptation of WiMAX, relative to its terrestrial counterpart, are reduced link margin and longer transmission delays - both absolute delay from the center of a spot beam to the satellite and differential delay between the beam edge and the beam center to the satellite. These considerations suggest adaptation of the sub-channelization schemes, the frame synchronization methods, and the ranging process in WiMAX to make it operable over satellite, while keeping the general framework of the WiMAX protocol stack intact, thereby facilitating the incorporation of S-WiMAX into a common baseband processor with terrestrial WiMAX; this allows S-WiMAX to be added to terrestrial WiMAX devices with minimal cost and form-factor impact. Methods for these adaptations are considered here.",

It proposes to enrich an optical burst switching network with a session control layer that can close the gap between application requests and network control. The session control layer is implemented using the session initiation protocol, giving birth to what is called a SIP-OBS architecture. The article discusses the important added value of this architecture, and shows that it may support a number of end-to-end resource discovery and reservation strategies (for both network and non-network resources). Finally, it presents a testbed implementation where this approach was experimentally validated.",

      "abstract": "Online social network applications severely suffer from various security and privacy exposures. This article suggests a new approach to tackle these security and privacy problems with a special emphasis on the privacy of users with respect to the application provider in addition to defense against intruders or malicious users. In order to ensure users' privacy in the face of potential privacy violations by the provider, the suggested approach adopts a decentralized architecture relying on cooperation among a number of independent parties that are also the users of the online social network application. The second strong point of the suggested approach is to capitalize on the trust relationships that are part of social networks in real life in order to cope with the problem of building trusted and privacy- preserving mechanisms as part of the online application. The combination of these design principles is Safebook, a decentralized and privacy- preserving online social network application. Based on the two design principles, decentralization and exploiting real-life trust, various mechanisms for privacy and security are integrated into Safebook in order to provide data storage and data management functions that preserve users' privacy, data integrity, and availability. Preliminary evaluations of Safebook show that a realistic compromise between privacy and performance is feasible.",

      "abstract": "The growing demand for wireless Internet services is accelerating the evolution of wireless networks toward all-IP architecture, and the mobile WiMAX network is a prominent example. Although currently deployed mobile WiMAX networks use hierarchical architecture, flat architecture is feasible and specified as a design alternative in the mobile WiMAX standard. In flat architecture the functionalities of the ASN-GW and BS are consolidated into a single element. In this article we first discuss the benefits and challenges of flat architecture mobile WiMAX networks. We then present a scheme to deal with the seamless mobility issue, which is one of the key challenges of the flat architecture. The proposed scheme combines two standard IP-mobility protocols, Proxy Mobile IP and Fast Mobile IP, and customizes them for IEEE 802.16e-based mobile WiMAX networks. This provides interoperability with existing mobile WiMAX networks. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme through simulations using NS-2.",

      "abstract": "Implantable devices hold great potential for pervasive healthcare, enabling the identification, monitoring, and treatment of patients regardless of their location. To realize this goal, these devices must be able to communicate wirelessly with external devices. However, wireless communication presents many vulnerabilities: an attacker can eavesdrop on transmitted information, use implanted devices to track patients, or spoof an implanted device. An attacker even has the potential to cause direct physical harm to a patient, either by forcibly removing an implanted device from the patient or by maliciously sending commands that affect the operation of an implanted device. Addressing these security threats is crucial for implantable devices due to their permanent nature, but it is difficult because of the severe resource constraints facing such devices. This article details the threats that face wireless implantable devices, surveys the work addressing these threats, and identifies open issues for future research.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, costly and slow integration has created an unnecessary gap between the telephone companies (or telco) and IT worlds. However, collaboration between Internet and telecom standards is essential for future development. The service broker concept has been developed to fill this gap. Indeed, the service broker provides a flexible layer in the telecom architecture to bridge these two worlds. Such a concept is essential to coordinate the diverse future services and provide mashup opportunities through a single point of entry. In this article we present the concept and an actual implementation of a specific service broker: a location service broker. Moreover, we also present a sample mashup called MoPoint that we implemented to better demonstrate the functionality of the location service broker. MoPoint is a Web site where the user can see the current location of his or her mobile displayed on a map along with local weather and advertisements.",

With its origins in noncoherent modulation and detection for communication at rates under 100 b/s, phase-coherent digital communication systems employing multichannel adaptive equalization with explicit symbol-timing and phase tracking are being deployed in commercial and military systems, enabling rates in excess of 10 kb/s. Research systems have been shown to further dramatically increase performance through the use of spatial multiplexing. Iterative equalization and decoding has also proven to be an enabling technology for dramatically enhancing the robustness of such systems. This article provides a brief overview of signal processing methods and advances in underwater acoustic communications, discussing both single carrier and emerging multicarrier methods, along with iterative decoding and spatial multiplexing methods.",

Future network architectures are expected to be self-protecting and, more generally, self-organizing. In this article we describe the modeling methods and simulation tools we have used for the analysis of a new integrated restoration scheme operating at multiple layers/networks. The networks over which we have performed the analysis are ATM and SDH, but the methodology could be applied to other multilayer architectures too. A network model has been created that consists of both ATM and SDH layers. Using this network model, we have seen how the new scheme explores the free bandwidth over both layers. The multilayer bandwidth exploration was modeled using Microsoft Visual C++. Using OPNET Modeler, a node model was created to analyze the restoration message processing within it and the interaction with other nodes for the purpose of simulating the restoration delay. The article emphasizes the simulation methodology rather than the results of the simulation. Among others, we describe which additional functionalities a simulation tool is necessary to have in order to simulate multilayer networks. A comparison of OPNET and Microsoft Visual C++ is made, describing their advantages and the reasons we found it necessary to use both.",

      "abstract": "In this article we define and analyze the routing and wavelength assignment problem by applying a virtual topology for both the optical network and the light paths. We introduce our developed algorithm to solve offline RWA problem. First the light path requests are constrained to repeated uniform distributed traffic. The reason is that this constraint permits us to study and analyze the behavior of the RWA problem. In addition, this constraint could be used as a benchmark to compare different algorithms. Then we relax the requests constraint to be non-uniform traffic. We show that the maximum number of assigned wavelengths depends on the number of traversed links, not on the shortest path length. Theorems are derived with proof to justify our algorithm. The effect of adding supplementary links to the WDM optical network is also explained to show how this approach could be used in the future planning for online operation. Finally, the result shows significant different in the number of wavelengths used compared to a recent backbone implemented network.",

In this article, after briefly reviewing the existing major technology options, we propose a novel, spectrum- efficient, and scalable optical transport network architecture called SLICE. The SLICE architecture enables sub-wavelength, superwavelength, and multiple-rate data traffic accommodation in a highly spectrum-efficient manner, thereby providing a fractional bandwidth service. Dynamic bandwidth variation of elastic optical paths provides network operators with new business opportunities offering cost-effective and highly available connectivity services through time-dependent bandwidth sharing, energy-efficient network operation, and highly survivable restoration with bandwidth squeezing. We also discuss an optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based flexible-rate transponder and a bandwidth-variable wavelength cross-connect as the enabling technologies of SLICE concept. Finally, we present the performance evaluation and technical challenges that arise in this new network architecture.",

The CARMEN access network will complement existing access technologies by exploiting low cost mesh networking techniques, thus minimizing deployment and maintenance costs. The CARMEN architecture introduces an abstraction layer that hides the specifics of the underlying access technology providing an abstract interface on top of which higher layers can be easily developed. This allows for the integration of current and future heterogeneous wireless technologies to provide scalable and efficient mobile ubiquitous Internet access, able to adapt to different environments and user requirements. Following these goals, CARMEN aims to define, study and implement link and technology abstractions, mobility support, and quality of service. The architecture also includes advanced monitoring features that allow for dynamic self-configuration, thereby reducing the installation and operational costs.",

      "abstract": "The current TD-SCDMA commercialization in China brings about many issues concerning the implementation of TD-SCDMA technology, the market, and its applications. In order to make TD-SCDMA successful, evolution from the current TD-SCDMA standards to international mobile telecommunications-advanced are anticipated. TD-SCDMA standards and technologies will take a home-made evolution path in China, aiming at a smooth migration to the next-generation mobile communication system. This article provides a brief description of the evolution strategies of both the standards and key technologies, in which the evolution is divided into three phases. The state of the art of TD-SCDMA evolution is surveyed, and its technologies and standards in different evolution phases are characterized. Single- and multi-carrier high-speed packet access is specified in the first evolution phase for guaranteeing the high transmission bit rate of packet services. Meanwhile, broadcast services are supported, and the HSPA evolution is also incorporated in this phase. Long term evolution is defined in the second evolution phase for approaching similar performance as mobile WiMAX, where channel-reciprocity- based multiple antenna techniques are utilized. The last phase is the revolution to the IMT-Advanced system and becoming one alternative standard in beyond 3G systems, which is based on the evolution of TD-LTE. The difference of standardizations between 3GPP and local standard releases are introduced. Some challenging work and open issues in different evolution phases are discussed as well.",

After over 100 years of triumph, public telegraphy left the communications market. But telex took over and evolved into massively popular forms such as SMS and email, while telephony remains the most widely used means of communication in the world today. Over the past century or so, communications technologies have advanced from manual to automatic switching and from analog to digital communications, alongside many other major technological revolutions.",

      "abstract": "The following article provides a concise, clearly written discussion of the history of the well-known Aloha protocol by Prof. Norman Abramson, the key individual responsible for its invention, development, and initial deployments in a variety of applications involving joint use of a given medium by potentially interfering systems. He discusses the use of this protocol and its various incarnations, continuing to this day, in such disparate applications as wired Ethernet, satellite communications, and mobile wireless systems, among others. What is, in my mind, so amazing about this scheme is its basic simplicity, yet profound ability to find application in such a widespread range of communication systems. The protocol, in its most concise form, says transmit at will. If interference is detected, retransmit some random time later. What can be simpler? Yet, despite its apparent simplicity, such a protocol was not at all obvious at the time of its invention and initial deployment. Enjoy reading this article!",

      "abstract": "The LTE radio interface for 3GPP Release 8 was specified recently. This article describes the LTE link-layer protocols, which abstract the physical layer and adapt its characteristics to match the requirements of higher layer protocols. The LTE link-layer protocols are optimized for low delay and low overhead and are simpler than their counterparts in UTRAN. The stateof- the-art LTE protocol design is the result of a careful crosslayer approach where the protocols interact with each other efficiently. This article provides a thorough overview of this protocol stack, including the sub-layers and corresponding interactions in between them, in a manner that is more intuitive than in the respective 3GPP specifications.",

      "abstract": "The mobile communications market has grown rapidly over the past ten years, but the market could reach saturation in the foreseeable future. More flexible mobile networks that can meet various user demands and create new market openings are required for further growth. Heterogeneous networks are more suitable than homogeneous networks for meeting a wide variety of user demands. There are two types of heterogeneous networks: a closed type, where network resources are deployed and operated by communication carriers, and an open type, where network resources can be deployed not only by existing operators, but also by companies, universities, and so on. It will be easy for newcomers to enter mobile businesses in an open heterogeneous mobile network so many innovative services are likely to be provided through cooperation between various companies or organizations. This article proposes a revised architecture for TISPAN-NGN, which corresponds to heterogeneous networks and open mobile markets, and presents a new business model.",

      "abstract": "Many network administration organizations, including communication service providers, are faced with the problem of managing a growing number of applications with fewer administrators. Administrators are required to provision and administer application-specific data in order for users (e.g., subscribers) to access and use communication applications. Although there are several approaches for solving the problem of sharing identity data across applications, a general solution for provisioning and sharing the complete user or subscriber profile has not been defined. This article describes the design and implementation of an extensible, user-management service that solves the problem of the redundant data entry required in provisioning and maintaining multiple communication applications. An important aspect of the design is the capability of the user-management service to be extended at run time without requiring an upgrade of the service and without impacting already deployed applications. Key lessons that can be applied to reduce the time and cost for other organizations faced with implementing user- or subscriber-management projects also are described.",

      "abstract": "The Power Utility of Serbia Company intends to migrate portions of its time-division-multiplexing- based telephony network to IP. The high-level, capital project requirements include: (a) building a new VoIP infrastructure; (b) exchanging approximately one-third of the existing TDM-based PBXs with new VoIP based and hybrid PBXs; and (c) integrating these new PBXs with the remaining existing legacy PBXs to create a new hybrid network. Telephony service availability should be five nines (99.999 percent), a requirement that created a derived requirement for network element redundancy. One of the most important elements is the softswitch. The softswitch is the equipment responsible for call control of IP phones and voice gateways at the level of the Power Utility of Serbia Company telephone network. Softswitch redundancy in a failover configuration proved to be most challenging because of a performance requirement to achieve a switchover time of six seconds or less, whereas commercially available softswitches typically support switchover times of a few minutes. Another significant challenge was integrating the legacy PBXs and new (VoIP) PBXs. Although industry marketing promotes SIP trunking as the preferred integration/interconnection method, we found that with the exception of bearer traffic (voice media) pathing, service interoperability between the equipment of different vendors was often problematic. Vendors typically suggest Q.Sig as an interconnection alternative when SIP trunking is infeasible, but some vendor interoperability problems persisted. This article presents technical solutions to these major issues that can benefit similar TDM-to-IP migration and hybridization projects.",

      "abstract": "The ZODIAC project has been exploring a security first approach to networking based on a new idea, the dynamic community of interest, based on groups of users with a demonstrable need to know. ZODIAC uses the most challenging network setting (the mobile ad hoc network) as a target, since each node must incorporate functions of both hosts and routers. The realization of the DCoI is a work in progress, but initial implementation results have shown that DCoI concepts can be translated into working systems. The current system applies virtual machine containers, extensive use of cryptography and digital signatures, dispersity routing, DHT-based naming, and explicit rate control among other advanced techniques. Putting security to the forefront in the design has led to interesting consequences for naming, authorization, and connection setup. In particular, it has demanded a hierarchical structure for DCoIs that may initially appear somewhat alien to Internet users. Nonetheless, our implementation has illustrated that a highly available network that provides confidentiality and integrity can be constructed and made usable.",

      "abstract": "In this issue of the History Column we bring you an article by Prof. Peter Kirstein, one of the original contributors to early packet switching. We are probably all familiar with the history of the Internet, beginning with its genesis in the American-developed ARPAnet of the late 1960s and early 1970s. We may be less familiar with the contributions of British researchers, as well as those in other countries such as France, at about the same period of time, who worked closely with American researchers as well as independently in developing the packet-switching technology so fundamental to the Internet. Prof. Kirstein recounts the early activities by British engineers, led by Donald Davies of the National Physical Laboratory, the British Post Office, those of his own group at University College London, and others as well. He also ties this work into ongoing activities in the United States at the time. In future History Columns we plan to have similar articles by U.S. packet-switching pioneers on their own early activities in the field. This series of articles on the genesis of the Internet should be of great interest to all communication engineers. We commend the article following to your attention.",

Although multihop relaying for coverage extension in wireless networks is an old concept, it became practical only recently. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the IEEE 802.16 working group, which has devoted a task group to incorporating relay capabilities in the foundation of mobile WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e-2005. Currently, this task group is in the process of finishing IEEE 802.16j, the multihop relay specification for 802.16. This amendment will be fully compatible with 802.16e-2005 mobile and subscriber stations, but a BS specific to 802.16j will be required for relays to operate. This article presents an introduction to the upcoming IEEE 802.16j amendment and provides insight about the obstacles that practical system designers face when incorporating relaying into a wireless broadband network.",

      "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of those ideas that had been building for a very long time, and became a practical reality when the appearance of mass market applications coincided with the availability of efficient software and electronic technologies. This article describes the background and some of the striking early development of OFDM, with explanation of the motivations for using it. The author presume a broad definition of OFDM as frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) in which subchannels overlap without interfering. It does not not necessarily require the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or its fast Fourier transform (FFT) computational method.",

It is an all-IP technology based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which is more spectrally efficient - meaning it can deliver more bits per Hertz. This paper present the video, flay-rate pricing, and connected devices that all contribute to the growing demand for mobile data services. The world of telecommunications, people today are more connected and more mobile than ever. We have more devices and more ways to stay in touch with one another. The Internet and wireline worlds are experiencing a rapid convergence of IP video, audio, and data into completely new applications. Users want that same on-demand access and Internet, multimedia experience, and content anywhere from any device.",

      "abstract": "Security and reliability issues are of utmost importance in transparent optical networks due to the extremely large fiber throughput. Fast and successful reaction and restoration mechanisms performed by failure management can prevent loss of large amounts of critical data, which can cause severe service disruption. In this article we discuss failure management issues in TONs, the mechanisms involved, and optical monitoring techniques. Furthermore, we propose applying structural properties of self-organizing systems to create a \"small world\" hybrid supervisory plane that can enable faster system-wide communication. We also investigate the possibility of a scale-free structure aimed at improving robustness in the network and propose various topology generation algorithms.",

      "abstract": "This article highlights the trends that are reshaping the international long distance voice market. Our analysis focuses on voice exchanges, namely, electronic marketplaces where huge volumes of ILD voice traffic are traded and routed. Various existing models of voice exchanges are compared: Arbinet, which started in 1996, providing TDM circuit-switched interconnection; and newer exchanges, based natively on VoIP, namely, voice peering fabric by stealth, infiniroute, Xconnect, and Arena by interoute. The evolution of interconnection mechanisms and the consequent impact on the role of exchanges are discussed. The calling party's network pays and the Bill &amp; Keep interconnection commercial models are presented, and we discuss issues for their applicability. Per-volume and flatfee charging models for interconnection between operators are compared. Finally, the impact of these models on future business scenarios of voice exchanges is analyzed. The way in which call termination models will change in the future is uncertain. Regulatory aspects, service-specific requirements, country-specific issues, and market dynamics must all be taken into consideration prior to establishing the interconnection regime that will be widely adopted in the future.",

The use of HARQ can contribute to efficient utilization of the available resources and the provision of reliable services in latest-generation systems. This article focuses on wireless systems using HARQ with emphasis on the multiple-input multiple-output paradigm. MIMO-HARQ offers new opportunities because of the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver. The architecture of MIMO transceivers that are based on bit-interleaved coded modulation and employ HARQ is described. Additionally, receiver implementations are presented and compared in terms of complexity, memory requirements, and performance.",

We show that the performance of TCP in overlay CR networks that implement DSA to be quite different from its performance in conventional networks, which do not allow DSA. The key difference is that secondary users in an overlay CR network have to cope with a new type of loss called service interruption loss, due to the existence of primary users. We demonstrate on an NS2 simulation testbed the surprising result: Excessive radio resource usage leads to a decrease in aggregate TCP throughput. This behavior is in contrast to the behavior of TCP in conventional networks, where throughput increases monotonically with the available radio resource.",

We show that asymmetric carrier sensing and/or interference relations commonly exist in wireless mesh networks, and we study their impact on the link capacity and fair-channel access. In addition, we investigate the effect of traffic rate on link capacity in the presence of interference.",

      "abstract": "The Software Communications Architecture is an open architecture developed by the U.S. Department of Defense to standardize the development of software-defined radio, improve communication systems interoperability, and reduce development and deployment costs. The SCA facilitates software reuse and technology insertion by abstracting radio applications from the supporting platform and defining a common operational environment across platforms. The SCA relies on commercial standards, classic software engineering principles, and software design patterns. While some SCA design choices are controversial and tightly tied to the specific needs for which it was developed, the basic design principles of software reuse and abstraction are sound and necessary if SDR is to achieve its full potential. Some of the techniques and concepts used in the SCA may be foreign to a communications engineer, and can result in confusion and long learning curves. The understanding of these concepts is of great relevance for communications engineers independent of any opinion about the SCA itself. This tutorial is aimed at educating communication engineers on these software engineering principles and describing how the SCA applies them to achieve its goals. We describe the different interfaces of the SCA that provide a framework for the implementation of SDR. The tutorial provides introductory material to understand the basic operation of the SCA as implemented in the Open-Source SCA Implementation::Embedded developed by Wireless @ Virginia Tech.",

      "abstract": "Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors: attenuation that increases with signal frequency, time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound (1500 m/s). The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites.",

      "abstract": "System-level simulation has been widely used to evaluate system performance. Simulation methodologies have also been comprehensively discussed in different organizations or institutions. Most of the simulation methodologies proposed, however, mainly focus on one area of specific technologies. How to evaluate the performance of multiple air interface systems (e.g., cdma2000, WCDMA, WiMAX, and their evolutions) in a fair and comprehensive manner has not been addressed extensively. This article presents a unified simulation methodology, including fading channel models, system configurations, and how to consider technology-dependent algorithms such as scheduling, overhead modeling, interference margin definition, and resource allocation based on system loading. This article uses this framework to compare three major existing radio technologies: cdma2000 1x EV-DO Rev. A, WCDMA HSPA, and mobile WiMAX based on 802.16e. Key simulation results based on our suggested system models and settings are presented and analyzed. It is shown that under our unified framework, the two CDMA systems exhibit higher spectrum efficiency than mobile WiMAX, especially on the downlink, while mobile WiMAX provides a higher peak rate.",

In this article we first present the key requirements for accurate simulations that arise from the various applications supported by VANETs, and review the current state-of the-art VANET simulation tools. We then present VGSim, an integrated networking and microscopic vehicular mobility simulation platform. VGSim provides full-fledged wireless network simulation with an accurate traffic mobility model. These two components are tightly integrated and can interact dynamically. We discuss the flexibility of VGSim in adopting different mobility models and also present simulation results that empirically validate the modified mobility model we implemented. We discuss how VANET applications can be easily modeled in VGSim, and demonstrate this using two important applications, Accident Alert and Variable Speed Limit.",

The underlying V2V channels, as a foundation for the understanding and design of V2V communication systems, have not yet been sufficiently investigated. This article aims to review the state-of-the-art in V2V channel measurements and modeling. Some important V2V channel measurement campaigns and models are briefly described and classified. Finally, some challenges of V2V channel measurements and modeling are addressed for future studies.",

For this reason, V2X communication has been considered a key technology of the future Intelligent Transportation Systems. Use cases for V2X communication for enhancing intersection safety are appealing because intersections are the most complex and dangerous driving environments. This article reviews major related work and presents a communication architecture for intersection safety that supports these use cases. Our communication architecture respects the salient traits of V2X communication and fits into the overall V2X communication architecture. We perform various simulations to quantify the load of V2X communication at intersections and report the findings of our simulation study.",

More and more home computers are running on an always-on basis (e.g., media centers or file sharing clients). Such home environments have not been sufficiently analyzed regarding the possibility of aggregating home user resources in an energy-efficient way. This article describes a future home environment in which available hardware resources (e.g., CPU cycles, disk space, or network capacity) are shared energy efficiently and balanced among end users. Furthermore, the article provides an overview of different virtualization methods that are needed in future home environments to enable cooperation of home networks. Virtualization-related requirements are discussed in detail and virtualization methods and concepts are compared to each other with respect to their usability in the architecture.",

He also considered the bandwidth requirements of discrete signal transmission for telegraphy and images. Kotelnikov subsequently worked on scrambling, cryptography, optimal detection, and planetary radar (including the radar-assisted cartography of Venus). He was awarded numerous Soviet and international prizes, and played a major role in Soviet academic and professional life in the field of radio engineering. Yet his achievements are still comparatively little known outside Russia.",

This work is an attempt to understand an analog hardwired communication system of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, and effectively translate it into a generic standards-based VoIP system that runs on their existing data network. We develop insights into the air traffic training and weigh in on the design choices for building a soft real-time data communication system. We also share our real world deployment and maintenance experiences, as the FAA Academy has been successfully using this VoIP system in six training rooms since early 2006 to train the future air traffic controllers of the U.S. and the world.",

      "abstract": "The evolved 3GPP system is a hybrid mobile network architecture supporting several radio access technologies and several mobility mechanisms. In this article we briefly review the architecture and key components of this system, with particular emphasis on how it can support voice call mobility in several deployment scenarios. First, we present the so-called single-radio voice call continuity mechanisms that enable mid-call handover of VoIP calls from E-UTRAN access to the legacy UTRAN/GERAN or lxRTT access. Then we focus on deployment scenarios that do not support voice services on E-UTRAN and present the so-called fallback mechanisms that enable handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN or lxRTT at the beginning of a voice call. Finally, we address the application- layer voice call handover mechanisms enabled by the IP multimedia subsystem. Our conclusion is that the next generation of 3GPP systems are highly sophisticated mobile communication systems that support extended voice call mobility mechanisms, capable of addressing all commercial deployment needs.",

Femtocells have gained a lot of attention recently due to their advantages in terms of infrastructure cost saving and improved user experience in indoor environments. Several standards bodies, such as 3GPP, WiMAX Forum, and IEEE 802.16, have started to develop standard solutions to enable and optimize femtocells operation. However, there are some technical challenges to the success of femtocell technologies that need to be overcome before they can be deployed on large scales. This article presents an overview of WiMAX femtocell requirements, deployment models, and solutions in the near and long terms.",

Hence, the vast majority of research efforts thus far have focused on the development of energy-efficient communication and computing mechanisms for WSNs. In this article a fundamentally different approach and hence completely new WSN paradigm, the wireless passive sensor network, is introduced. The objective of the WPSN is to eliminate the limitation on system lifetime of the WSN. In a WPSN power is externally supplied to the sensor network node via an external RF source. Modulated backscattering is discussed as an alternative communication scheme for WPSNs. The feasibility is investigated along with the open research challenges for reliable communication and networking in WPSNs.",

      "abstract": "Over the last two decades the importance of data networking for human beings and systems has increased beyond any expectation in size, complexity, and impact on society. Today, technology offers the ubiquitous and constant possibility of being connected to the Internet at a wide range of speeds. Traditional management solutions have up to now followed an evolutionary path, although the scale of the Internet and emerging novel architectures such as peer-to-peer, ad hoc networks, as well as virtualization-capable network infrastructures require focused and possibly revolutionary changes in management approaches. This article elaborates on challenges posed by the renaissance of virtualization as experienced in the planning, development, and operation of the FEDERICA infrastructure. The European Community cofunded project FEDERICA, like other worldwide initiatives such as FIND/GENI in the United States, NWGN in Japan, and the FIRE program in Europe, is supporting the development of the future Internet. FEDERICA extends the virtualization capabilities of the current hardware and software to provide a flexible infrastructure to host disruptive testing by networking researchers.",

      "abstract": "Can an entire technology ecosystem be designed? Although we usually think of design and implementation in relation to particular features or applications, overall technologies - such as the session initiation protocol for voice over IP or the hypertext transfer protocol for the World Wide Web - can constrain the set of possible solutions to more well-bounded problems. Given the large scope of a technology ecosystem (including protocols, software implementations, application types, service deployments, and various stakeholders), we would expect to find that some of its aspects can be designed, some aspects can be guided in an approximate fashion, and other aspects exhibit an emergent order or no order whatsoever. To investigate such issues, this article summarizes some of the challenges faced, and lessons learned, by the extensible messaging and presence protocol developer community since 1999.",
