   "abstract": "Three LAN technologies look set to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for LAN bandwidth. Two of these technologies are 100 Mb/s shared-medium LANs: 100Base-T (aka IEEE 802.3 Fast Ethernet) and IEEE 802.12 (aka 100VG-AnyLAN or 100VG). The third technology is packet switching, which is really an extension of existing LAN bridge technology, but offers excellent performance gains at very low cost. The authors describe the three technologies and provide a comparison between the two 100 Mb/s LANs. Also presented are results that compare the measured performance of 100 Mb/s shared-medium LANs with switched LANs.",

   "abstract": "The complete integration of a satellite network with a terrestrial cellular network is a system architecture challenge that requires solving problems at both the transmission and network levels. However, the potential advantages of the integrated system suggest careful study of the appropriate solutions. The main technical advantages are: a limited increase in the complexity of the terminal for both the satellite and terrestrial systems, making it attractive for its potential low cost; the fixed earth stations (FESs) of the satellite system are similar to cellular base stations and switching centers, this avoids expensive development of FESs, which can be adapted from the terrestrial stations and may even be collocated with some of them, saving the common parts. The main operational benefits that could be achieved are the extension of the mobile services (bearer services, teleservices, supplementary services) offered by the terrestrial system to not yet covered areas, Eastern Europe and North Africa, aeronautical and maritime mobiles, so that one integrated land/aeronautical/maritime (LAM) system could be conceived for all mobiles. The European COST 227 Integrated Space/Terrestrial Mobile Networks project is discussed.",

   "abstract": "The trend toward client/server computing and the growing complexity of management tasks requires a service-oriented definition of the business processes involved in managing distributed systems and networks. Service-oriented management calls for an integrated top-down approach, that is, evaluating the services offered and the networks and systems used in order to select and customize management systems. The corporate operation framework (COF) is presented. This framework provides a general description and structuring format for IT management processes based on the service providers' point of view. A brief summary of the TMN-related management levels that can be described by using the COF is outlined. At the service level, services and their QoS are specified. How these services are realized is defined at the task level, where each service is assumed to be provided by the workforce through fulfilling certain tasks. The process level describes programs of actions (i.e., processes to be followed when working on a task). Each action within a process is mapped to specific tools that are described at the tool level. The COF clearly separates different description levels and provides well-defined interfaces between these levels. This precise description is a prerequisite for the flexibility and durability of the framework, for example, when replacing tools, changing processes or introducing in- and outsourcing to the organization.",

   "abstract": "Computer-supported telecommunications applications (CSTA) is one of the more important standards for computer-telecommunications interfaces, addressing service and protocol definitions used to provide a link between computers and telecommunications systems. The services provided on a CSTA link between a telecommunications and computer network work much like the services that telecommunication network provides to a user at an access point. At the point of attachment to a telecommunications network, the \"phone numbers\" are sufficient to describe the desired object for involvement with a service. If a new object were created for the purposes of CSTA (e.g., a monitoring group), an identifier which would work like a phone number in that network would be assigned to that object. Additional handle-identifiers are created and provided after a service is initiated to differentiate between instances of the service being provided. To show this relationship, a functional model was created.",

   "abstract": "Many of the most common protocols at layers two (media access), three (network), and above expect to operate over broadcast media such as IEEE 802.3/Ethernet or IEEE 802.5/token ring. LAN emulation provides a widely applicable means for transitioning these protocols to the connection-oriented ATM environment. A combination of centralized and distributed intelligence allows a star-plus-mesh topology of ATM virtual circuits to emulate broadcast media, while providing most of the advantages of connection-oriented media.",

   "abstract": "The effective management of access networks presents challenges which are not found in other sectors of the telecommunications network. The approaches being developed for the management modeling of access networks allow systems with different technologies and from different vendors to be managed in a uniform way. The functional architecture used for SDH can be generalized so that it is applicable to access networks, and this forms the basis of the modeling of their logical functionality. Technology-specific models of the various elements can be integrated into a technology-independent network model, and the physical resources and logical structure can be modeled to simplify repairs and improve inventory management. The development of standards for the management of the access network is an evolutionary process, but sufficient standards are now in place in order to achieve a useful level of functionality over a Q3 interface. Developing solutions that take advantage of the initial telecommunications management network (TMN) standards allows experiences to be fed back into the standards bodies to generate a more complete set of standard specifications, leading to the goal of access network management as part of a totally integrated TMN.",

   "abstract": "The authors describe a protocol that can adapt to the changing demands of a mix of synchronous transfer mode (STM) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) applications and efficiently allocate bandwidth to a variety of bursty traffic sources. In the case of a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network, the protocol resides in customer premises equipment (CPE) and a common head-end/central-office (HE/CO) controller. A medium-access control (MAC) processor provides for dividing the time domain for a given digital bitstream into successive frames, each with multiple STM and ATM time slots. Within the STM region of a frame, variable-length time slots are allocated to calls (e.g., telephony, video telephony) requiring different amounts of bandwidth. In the upstream channels, a contention access signaling time slot is also provided in the STM region for call control and setup requests. Within the ATM region, fixed-length time slots accommodate one individual ATM cell. These ATM time slots may be reserved for a user for either the duration of a call or a burst of successive ATM cells, or shared via a contention process. At least one contention time slot is available for signaling messages related to ATM call control and setup requests. The MAC-layer protocol, its relation to circuit- and ATM-amenable applications, and its performance with respect to throughput, latency, and bandwidth efficiency for several service scenarios are examined.",

Using a combination of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) multiplex and cross-connect equipment, Africa ONE brings together a unique blend of technology to achieve network robustness. The article traces the need for this regional network and how it fits into the global undersea communications network. Also the authors describe the network elements that make up the transmission topology, the methodology used for interconnecting each African country to this network, protection and restoration of the network, and the network management system. Africa-ONE is a 40,000 km trunk and branch network that is planned to be ready for service in 1999. The present article presents the architecture of the undersea portion of the Africa-ONE project.",

   "abstract": "A central issue in congestion control for the available bit rate (ABR) service in ATM networks is the computation of the fair rate for every connection at each switching node in the network. The objective is to determine the fair rate for all the connections in a distributed network under dynamic changes in the absence of centralized knowledge about the network, and without the synchronization of different network components. The authors study the problem of fair rate allocation, specifying the requirements of a fair rate allocation algorithm, and provide a survey of various proposed fair rate allocation strategies in the context of the ABR service.",

   "abstract": "Discusses the integration of the telephone into the desktop work environment. This objective can be achieved in a number of different ways. The approach described uses the client-server model. Network telephony is a service that provides the capability to establish, answer, route, and terminate telephone calls under the control of applications on either desktop computers or servers resident in the network. It is accessed by applications via a standard programming interface (telephony services application programming interface, TSAPI) and utilizes a centralized server-based interface with the private branch exchange (PBX) to access the switching and telephone control services that the PBX provides. Creating a logical control link between the application software on the desktop computer and the telephone on the desk eliminates the need to physically connect the telephone to the desktop computer. The author distinguishes between the application programming interface and the network telephony service provider. The author assumes the services are provided by NTS R2.2 release and a PBX-based switching service. However, the author uses the term PBX to include switching services provided by key telephone or hybrid systems, PC-based telephony cards, or other appropriate technologies.",

The article presents a framework: for interworking between any wireless radio system and any data application on the wireline network. The interworking is provided by a common interworking function that uses a generic interworking control protocol (ICP). Any radio system capable of using the ISDN-based C-interface and implementing ICP can take advantage of the proposed approach. ICP is a generic protocol and can be implemented using different networks. The article considers an ISDN network for the lower-layer transport of ICP.

   "abstract": "The Internet has surfaced as the dominant early market for residential broadband. ADSL, a transmission system capable of realizing rates from 1 to Mb/s over existing telephone lines, fits Internet access requirements perfectly, and offers telephone companies a tool for connecting virtually all Internet users at megabit rates before the next century. ADSL is asymmetric-high-speed downstream, lower-speed upstream-to counteract speed limitations imposed by line length and crosstalk. The transmission technology itself has two essential forms, single-carrier and multicarrier, which must press Shannon's limit to squeeze so many bits through so little bandwidth. With complicated line coding and other features such as integral forward error correction and ATM/Ethernet mode interfaces, ADSL will be the most complex modem ever attached to a telephone line. This will not prevent ADSL from reaching consumer-level pricing within the next two years. We can expect some commercial deployment in 1997 and virtually ubiquitous availability by the end of 1999.",

   "abstract": "In broadband networks, it is expected that at a given time there will be more data in the network than in narrowband networks, and therefore, to maintain the same quality of service, failures will need to be restored much faster. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that broadband network technology, and in particular the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), has factors that enable much faster restoration in broadband networks. These can be summarized as: (i) the higher-speed processing and larger-volume storage possible with today's technology as compared to what was available for narrowband networks, (ii) faster failure detection by making use of ATM cell header error checks, (iii) easier and faster rerouting simply by changing cell headers, (iv) easier and faster splitting of virtual paths by changing cell headers, (v) higher fill factors in the new digital hierarchy due to full termination at cross-connects and switches, and (vi) the statistical multiplexing advantage that can be exploited in a full ATM network configuration. The authors describe four basic characteristics of broadband network restoration, made faster and more efficient because of the factors listed above. These are (i) hitless protection switching, (ii) robust and fast failure detection, (iii) restoration alternatives in broadband networks, and (iv) fast topology update for multiple failures. By employing a combination of these methods, fast restoration of broadband networks can be achieved. The techniques described enable a B-ISDN/ATM network to be constructed that is highly self-healing (i.e., can recover from failures without human intervention) and very fast.",

   "abstract": "Current efforts in digital data transmission over hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) networks will provide an efficient data transport mechanism for the \"last mile\" to residential users and will enable a very large number of services to the home. Provision of these services requires a complete end-to-end network architecture that provides an efficient connection between the server and the end user. Thus, it is necessary for the currently isolated HFC islands to gradually evolve into an efficient, highly connected, high-speed network. In this article, the authors review HFC networks and establish that they provide a more attractive and promising solution than the alternatives for \"last mile\" connectivity to the home, such as telephone connections. A list of broadband services are listed that are enabled by the high-speed data capabilities of HFC networks, and the necessary end-to-end infrastructure to support these applications is described, as well as possible evolution and migration paths for developing these end-to-end network architectures.",

   "abstract": "The authors describe a new cellular access architecture, known as capture-division packet access, which is a packet-oriented architecture able to support the constant bit rate traffic and variable bandwidth on demand necessary for multimedia traffic. The approach integrates the multiple access and channel reuse issues to achieve a high degree of spectral efficiency, and presents general advantages even if used for delay-constrained circuit-oriented traffic. Unlike CDMA and TDMA, wherein the effective data rate of each connection is typically a small fraction of the total radio channel allocated for PCN, the CDPA approach allows each user to access the entire channel, if necessary, for brief periods of time (packet access). Spectrum sharing is accomplished by exploiting the different path losses suffered by the various signals as they appear at the base stations (the capture effect), with co-channel interference abated through time diversity (colliding users do not successively retry in the same time interval). Results suggest that abating co-channel interference by random retransmission may be more effective than spatial isolation at cells using the same channel, as is usual in FDMA-TDMA systems.",

   "abstract": "Using telecommunication networks and shared databases, modern enterprises may deploy the applications that will hold the operations fabric of their enterprises together and improve their worldwide competitiveness. Enterprise-wide applications deployment is a complex systems integration project, even in cases of single-country deployment, because the computing platforms, databases, applications, and communications infrastructure have to be planned and deployed in concert with each other. When the regional and corporate headquarters are on different continents, network planners, data processing (DP) personnel, and executive management alike find themselves dealing with this multidiscipline problem complicated by multicontinental logistics. We consider a number of technical architecture options for the enterprise-wide applications deployment of intercontinental multisite operations and qualify them in terms of their feasibility, technical risks, capital and operation costs, and user satisfaction. We also address the spongy keyboard problem, a condition that may make centralized solutions unsuitable for intercontinental deployment. In choosing the technical architecture to support enterprise-wide applications, we consider the following options: centralized processing, autonomous processing with centralized batch consolidation, regionalized processing with ongoing centralized consolidation, and regionalized processing with global distributed consolidation.",

   "abstract": "High-speed networks use lightweight protocols and a simple switch architecture for achieving higher speeds. A lightweight switching technique for local area and campus environments is wormhole routing, in which the head of a packet (worm), upon arriving at an intermediate switch, is immediately forwarded to the next switch on the path. Thus, the packet, like a worm, may stretch across several intermediate switches and links. Wormhole routing networks provide low latency. However, they are particularly prone to congestion, thus requiring careful flow control. The authors consider high-speed, asynchronous, unslotted wormhole routing networks. For such networks, two different flow control mechanisms are compared and contrasted, namely, backpressure flow control and deflection routing (with local input rate control). With backpressure, in order to maintain deadlock-free routing, either up/down routing or shortest path routing with virtual channels is assumed. With deflection routing, to avoid livelocks, worm alignment (delayed deflection) is performed at the switches. It is shown via simulation that the throughput performance of the two schemes is comparable (except for up/down routing). The authors also discuss the tradeoffs with respect to the complexity of hardware, routing protocols and buffer requirements. The authors further examine the role of input rate control at the hosts to overcome unbounded delays typical of deflection routing, and show it is possible to achieve lower average number of hops and transit delays by employing suitable input rate control policies.",

   "abstract": "One of the basic problems faced in the design of efficient traffic and congestion control schemes is related to the wide variety of services with different traffic characteristics and quality of service (QoS) requirements supported by ATM networks. The authors propose a new way of organizing the control system so that complexity is easier to manage. The multi-agent system approach, which provides the use of adaptative and intelligent agents, is investigated. The authors show, through the two congestion control schemes proposed, how to take advantage of using intelligent agents to increase the efficiency of the control scheme. First, TRAC (threshold based algorithm for control) is proposed, which is based on the use of fixed thresholds which enables the anticipation of congestion. This mechanism is compared with the push-out algorithm and it is shown that the authors' proposal improves the network performance. Also discussed is the necessity of taking into account the network dynamics. In TRAC, adaptative agents with learning capabilities are used to tune the values of the thresholds according to the status of the system. However, in this scheme, when congestion occurs, the actions we perform are independent of the nature of the traffic. Subsequently, we propose PATRAC (predictive agents in a threshold based algorithm for control) in which different actions are achieved according to the QoS requirements and to the prediction of traffic made by the agents. Specifically, re-routing is performed when congestion is heavy or is expected to be heavy and the traffic is cell loss sensitive. This re-routing has to deflect the traffic away from the congestion point. In this scheme, we propose a cooperative and predictive control scheme provided by a multi-agent system that is built in to each node.",

   "abstract": "With the increasing demand for all kinds of wireless access services, including cellular/PCS, wireless local loop, and broadband access, the system architects will have opportunities to design new communication systems, not necessarily based on existing wireless standards. In the design of wireless communication systems, there are usually multiple objectives such as low cost, small size, high reliability, and large capacity. The system architect would need to study the trade-offs among different combinations of modulation, coding, multiple access, and antenna techniques to determine the best design. In this tutorial we focus on the trade-offs between user bandwidth and multi-user interference in order to maximize the system capacity. The design trade-offs are depicted on a B-/spl gamma//sub 0/ plane. Where B is the user bandwidth and /spl gamma//sub 0/ is the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I). For F/TDMA and CDMA systems, the author first shows that the contours of equal system capacity are straight lines with different slope's depending on the propagation environment, and the capacity decreases for increasing B and /spl gamma//sub 0/. Then as feasible solutions, the author plots the different combinations of modulation and coding with diversity to satisfy a certain quality of service in a multipath environment. The best design is obtained by moving a line with a certain slope from the lower left corner in the B-/spl gamma//sub 0/ plane until it touches the first feasible solution. From these plots we can see that, for example, while 1/2-rate channel coding is the best choice for F/TDMA systems, 1/3-rate is better for CDMA systems.",

   "abstract": "Progress of key technologies for the past 10 years and the state of realization of PACS and teleradiology in Japan are reviewed. Even though advanced electronic technologies have brought a rapid spread of PACS and teleradiology, the total number of installations is small compared with that of the hospital information system (HIS). The reason of this is a lack of economic incentives. The merits or benefits of PACS and teleradiology have to be appreciated and paid for by reimbursement of the associated costs from health insurance companies. The progress of PACS diffusion has been very rapid for these ten years in Japan, but most systems deployed are small-sized PACS. Examples of large PACS in Japan are presented and a method for integration with the HIS and RIS (radiological information system) is described. Standardization activities on PACS such as image data transfer and filing are also introduced. A unique domestic standard in Japan for IS&amp;C (image save and carry) and electronic filing of medical images is presented. The Japanese equivalent of the American standard DICOM is also described. Technology assessment of PACS is an important theme of study and investigation. An example of the measurement of pre- and postoperation of these systems is discussed.",

   "abstract": "A major health care provider is migrating its existing centralized computing system to a distributed computing infrastructure that will support advanced clinical, business, and workgroup applications and connectivity. Deploying a modern distributed architecture integrated with a traditional, heterogeneous mainframe-oriented enterprise data processing and information retrieval environment is an enormous undertaking. This process requires major changes for the enterprise, especially in the areas of the network, control and operations, systems deployment, integration and cost management tools, and personnel. Our case example is Kaiser Permanente Northern California Region (KPNCR). Information Technology Services (ITS), a division of KPNCR, provides network and computer support and operation, architecture and standards, and information technology. This division, in partnership with business planning and operational units, is responsible for creating the distributed architecture. The transition, estimated to take three to five years, is underway. ITS plans to deploy the proposed architecture at three medical facilities. This pilot will provide the technology foundation for a concurrent pilot of a planned enterprise-wide clinical information system. Results from the pilot will influence plans to deploy the distributed architecture enterprise-wide.",

As NTT's declaration of network opening (hereafter open network declaration, or OND) was made public in the midst of this controversy, it was sometimes mistaken as a counterproposal to escape from breaking up. However, its significance will become apparent when we trace the history of interconnection as well as competition in Japan. This article tries to identify several precedents of network opening, and to place OND appropriately in the public policy under competitive environment. The first section analyzes the performance of the telecommunications market and points out how barriers to competition have been eliminated or kept intact since its liberalization in 1985. The second section observes liberalization from a longer-term perspective, beginning in the early '70s, and describes how computer communication developed. The third section surveys how OND may change the business environment. The final section draws attention to the future, when many subnetworks are interlinked through OND, and emphasizes the importance of a dispute-settling mechanism for interconnection.",

In parallel, possible evolution paths from second to third generation systems have been presented, together with regulatory trends, Beyond the technological work performed under the RACE program, it is hoped that the new ACTS program will further the progress in developing wireless technologies while paying progressively growing attention to the development of a strategic vision of mobile and personal communications beyond the year 2000. Finally, a brief presentation of the ACTS program has shown that the coming years should be devoted to services validation through active user involvement in field trials. The results are expected to he of great use to potential operators, providing them the possibility of testing user acceptance of broadband mobile services. Future mobile communications systems will need to provide users with broadband capabilities and advanced services, allowing for seamless provision across fixed and mobile networks.",

   "abstract": "Vast importance is being placed in Europe on the development of third-generation mobile telecommunications systems, since it is expected that mobile and personal communications will become a key driver for growth and innovation in the next millenium as well as being a necessary building block of the wireless information society. Significant progress has been made since 1988 by a number of European Union funded R&amp;D projects working toward the development of future generations of mobile communication concepts, systems, and networks. The ACTS (Advanced Communications Technologies and Services) program will offer, in the period 1995-1998, service providers, communications operators, and equipment manufacturers greater opportunities to master and trial mobile and personal communications services and technologies. From the user's perspective the ACTS program will strive to ensure that current mobile services are extended to include multimedia and broadband services, that access to services are made without regard to the underlying networks, and that convenient, lightweight, compact, and power-efficient terminals adapt automatically to whatever air-interface parameters are appropriate to the user's location and desired services.",

   "abstract": "In the summer of 1993, the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) community began a search for a mechanism to allocate bandwidth dynamically within an ATM network, while simultaneously preventing data loss. By the fall of 1994, the ATM Forum had introduced a new service category for this purpose, the available bit rate (ABR) service, and had selected a rate-based mechanism for its support. Simply put, the mechanism would consist of a stream of ABR resource management (RM) cells, generated by one end of the connection (the source) and looped back by the other (the destination), into which switches would encode the maximum rate at which the ABR source was to generate data. The ABR service is an addition to ATM that uses a feedback mechanism to control the transmission rates of traffic sources. Although the performance of the ABR service will depend critically on the quality of feedback sent by switches, the algorithms for determining this feedback are largely outside the scope of ATM standards and specifications. We describe how two of the properties implemented by the ABR source and destination, out-of-rate RM cells and a use-it-or-lose-it policy, were implicitly architectural decisions, and we explain how and why the ATM Forum ultimately revised these decisions. We then discuss how the ATM Forum addressed the issues of conformance testing, point-to-multipoint connections, and parameter negotiation for the ABR service. At the end, we reflect on the process by which the ABR specification was developed.",

H.263 specifies a coded representation for compressing the moving picture component of audio-visual signals at low bit rates. The basic structure of the video source coding algorithm is taken from ITU-T Recommendation H.261 and is a hybrid of interpicture prediction to reduce temporal redundancy and transform coding of the prediction residual to reduce spatial redundancy. The source coder can operate on five standardized picture formats: sub-QCIF, QCIF, CIF, 4CIF, and 16CIF. The decoder has motion compensation capability with half-pixel precision, in contrast to H.261 which uses full-pixel precision and employs a loop filter. H.263 includes four negotiable coding options which provide improved coding efficiency: unrestricted motion vectors, syntax-based arithmetic coding, advanced prediction, and PB-frames.",

In addition to the multimedia terminal, other H.323 components are defined which provide for conference admissions (gatekeeper), multipoint communications (multipoint controller, multipoint processor), and interoperability (gateway) with terminals on other types of networks. H.323 has application to a variety of network media, including local area networks, enterprise networks, metropolitan area networks, wide area networks, dial-up line connections to LANs, and the Internet. This provides the capability to have global multimedia communications from the desktop using existing network infrastructures.",

   "abstract": "The telecommunications management network (TMN) architecture defines a framework for the management of telecommunications networks and services. It is based on a set of TMN standards developed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T), and is finding increased interest in the telecommunications industry, where rapid development of services and open architectures are in demand. Open systems interconnection (OSI) agent/managers as defined by the OSI systems management standards play a major role in the TMN architecture. However, the complexity of these standards, make the implementation of agent/managers and thus TMN systems a challenging task; methodologies and tools to ease the task of building agent/managers are needed. This article discusses the key difficulties in building OSI agent/managers and presents an architecture and a toolkit that can overcome them. The toolkit automates the generation of code that conforms to TMN and OSI standards, allowing the implementor to focus on the implementation of agent and manager specific components using the facilities provided by the toolkit.",

   "abstract": "There is a need for a general policy management architecture that can guide one in understanding and implementing policy in diverse management applications. The question of policy in network management has evolved since the early '70s concern with monitoring and controlling the access rights of multiple users and resources in large distributed systems. It is now generally acknowledged that policy also plays an important role in other areas of network management, including configuration, accounting, fault, and performance management. Furthermore, it is agreed that a general policy framework is needed for controlling the behavior of the agents the enterprise network comprises, including network users, administrators, troubleshooters, the applications running on the network, and the operational parameters of network hardware. The authors present a framework for understanding and implementing policy in the management of enterprise networks. We describe typical network scenarios in which policy plays a role, a general architecture for policy management and the components and operations of the architecture at a level of abstraction that renders it applicable to specific management tasks which require policy. We also provide an example of the architecture in configuration management. The article draws from work on policy management, including two ESPRIT projects.",

Five evolution scenarios toward UMTS are introduced, including a fixed network offering intelligent network and cordless terminal mobility services, cellular networks (i.e., GSM), cable networks offering wireless local loop, satellite networks, and a standalone UMTS scenario. Cooperation options for the identified systems and operators are identified.",

   "abstract": "Advances in information technology in the past decade have resulted in a proliferation of clinical information systems dedicated to individual user groups and clinical functional areas. This, in turn, has led to the need for hospital-wide management and integration of information, and has triggered major efforts towards the development of integrated hospital information systems. A framework for developing an integrated regional health telematics system is presented, based on the functional and data integration of federated autonomous information systems. The concept of the patient meta-record is introduced as a central element in achieving integration in terms of content, structure, and access to information resources. Intelligent image management at the level of either a single health care provider (hospital) or a regional health telematics network is addressed and is achieved through event and model-driven strategies enabled by a distributed hierarchical storage management system. Intelligence, in this context, refers to methods of efficient and effective real-time resource management in the timely delivery of health care.",

   "abstract": "Mutual exchange of status data between vehicles in close proximity is the basis for safe vehicle operation. Application areas range from driver assistance/warning to fully autonomous driving. To enable this data exchange we need an intervehicle communication (IVC) system. Vehicles involved in mutual data exchange form a kind of local area network; however, the characteristics of this network are quite different from those of conventional networks. The configuration of this kind of network changes from time to time, in terms of organization, proximity group, group position, and relative position; therefore, it is very challenging to establish. The authors have been working on this problem from the point of view of communication media and protocol. The characteristics and requirements of IVC are discussed, and several preliminary communication protocols are proposed. The authors also present some experimental results from the implementation of a function integrating communication by infrared ray with a gap-measuring technique by the vision system.",

   "abstract": "Six air interface standards for personal communications service (PCS) based on two different mobile application parts (MAPs) have been adopted by the TIA TR-46 committee, for PCS to deliver seamless communications, it is important to solve the interworking and interoperability (I&amp;I) issues between similar and dissimilar systems. We examine I&amp;I issues between similar and dissimilar systems. We focus on the I&amp;I issues related to authentication and registration, intersystem startup, intersystem handoff, and privacy, and point out the problems that must be addressed to achieve seamless communications for the PCS environment. The TIA's proposed solution to achieve I&amp;I between the IS-41 and DCS1900 MAPs is also evaluated using a simple traffic model in the metropolitan (urban) environment. The proposed solution puts a significant amount of additional signaling load on the network.",

   "abstract": "The author presents the standardized method used to isolate faulty routing tables in SS7 packet switched networks, and suggests an alternative for the future. The present method used has a drawback: the extra load it induces on the network. Furthermore, it requires the audit logic, with its associated software packages, in all the SS7 nodes. The alternative suggested by this article does not induce any extra load on the network. It does not require any special audit logic in the SS7 nodes. However, it requires a TMN infrastructure. There is no doubt that TMN will gradually become a reality. But before TMN products are available on a large scale, SS7 network operators will have to do with the existing method. Routing tables can be audited using the existing method, but extra care is needed in order to avoid overloading the network. Audits therefore have to be done with circumspection. They need to be carefully scheduled, especially when used to test periodically and thoroughly all the routing tables of an SS7 network.",

   "abstract": "The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has standardized three speech coders which are applicable to low-bit-rate multimedia communications. ITU Rec. G.729 8 kb/s CS-ACELP has a 15 ms algorithmic codec delay and provides network-quality speech. It was originally designed for wireless applications, but is applicable to multimedia communications as well. Annex A of Rec. G.729 is a reduced-complexity version of the CS-ACELP coder. It was designed explicitly for simultaneous voice and data applications that are prevalent in low-bit-rate multimedia communications. These two coders use the same bitstream format and can interoperate. The ITU Rec. G.723.1 6.3 and 5.3 kb/s speech coder for multimedia communications was designed originally for low-bit-rate videophones. Its frame size of 30 ms and one-way algorithmic codec delay of 37.5 ms allow for a further reduction in bit rate compared to the G.729 coder. In applications where low delay is important, the delay of G.723.1 may be too large. However, if the delay is acceptable, G.723.1 provides a lower-complexity alternative to G.729 at the expense of a slight degradation in quality. This article describes the attributes of speech coders such as bit rate, complexity, delay, and quality. Then it discusses the basic concepts of the three new ITU coders by comparing their specific attributes. The second part of this article describes the standardization process for each of these coders.",

   "abstract": "Interactive residential broadband/multimedia services are expected to be the next main event in the cyberspace experience. The large excess bandwidth (well over 300 MHz) available in today's cable TV (CATV) hybrid fiber/coaxial (HFC) plants is an ideal candidate to provide the underlying communications infrastructure for interactive digital services to the home; cable operators that have not yet upgraded their all-coaxial plants to HFC are quickly moving in this direction. MLAP is a flexible ATM-friendly MAC protocol that is capable of supporting various types of traffic with diverse quality-of-service requirements. We introduce a very versatile MAC protocol for the HFC 802.14 network. MLAP can provide integrated broadband services to the home, internetwork easily with ATM wide area networks, support QoS constraints for various types of traffic, and operate over a variety of physical layer protocols. Our presentation is only an extended summary of our medium-sharing protocol proposal to the IEEE 802.14 WG. We consider only error-free system operation. MLAP provides for the use of timers for the recovery of error situations in the network. MLAP is also supported by a management suite of protocols for management of the overall system.",

   "abstract": "Demand for bandwidth seems unstoppable, and investment in network infrastructure is massive. There is a desire that network operators be able to manage these networks in an efficient manner, with flexibility to support new customer service opportunities faster and cheaper. Network operators are looking to standards to help them meet this challenge. The telecommunications management network (TMN) model, so effective in describing how management information must support needs at the element, network, and service levels, provides a good starting point. However, if the supporting standards are not developed and used wisely, a TMN approach can have the opposite effect of adding cost and removing flexibility. Technology-specific \"stovepipes\" may make it impossible to manage services across a range of technologies. The authors express their views on the need for a service-driven approach to standards implementation. They point out specific challenges operators will face as they approach their management systems' needs for broadband services, and encourage service providers and network operators to take a more proactive role in defining their needs.",

   "abstract": "With the growing complexity of communication protocols, it is increasingly difficult for application developers to interface the applications to the communication stacks across a number of platforms. A common application program interface (API) is needed for the purpose. The API can effectively conceal the complexities of communication protocols and architecture, making it easier for application development. This article presents the modeling and development of a generic API, XOM and an application-specific API, XMP. XOM API provides a general-purpose data handling mechanism and XMP API provides service primitives to network management protocols. The development is based on object-oriented technology. The attractiveness of object-oriented implementation is its ability to provide encapsulation, reusability and extensibility in the software modules. The benefits and difficulties encountered during the implementation are to be discussed. The experience will be useful for API development.",

In DS-CDMA communications, all of the users' signals overlap in time and frequency and cause mutual interference. The conventional DS-CDMA detector follows a single-user detection strategy in which each user is detected separately without regard for the other users. A better strategy is multi-user detection, where information about multiple users is used to improve detection of each individual user.

   "abstract": "The coherence of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) was based on the understanding that, to further common interests, the terminals and networks were to be coordinated to allow the transparent flow of traffic. Innovations were evaluated based on the overall system performance and the potential number of connections. The evolution of public networks and technological advancements, of course, have allowed traffic types other than speech to be carried over the PSTN. However, because stakeholders in multimedia communications often have conflicting requirements, they usually promote application-specific approaches to code source information and multiplex the different media streams. Rarely do they ponder over possible ways to merge all these approaches in a harmonious way. Multimedia communications straddle the traditions of both telecommunications and information technologies. As the technology evolves, it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify the boundary of \"networks\".",

ISDN could be used in some low-end applications, but many telemedicine applications will require the higher bandwidth and guaranteed qualities of service supported by ATM. We discuss the design of multimedia systems for telemedicine. First, various applications of telemedicine are presented, and their multimedia and communications requirements are discussed. A telemedicine prototype is then presented, each of its components discussed, and a potential future telemedicine system is shown.",

   "abstract": "The article presents a techno-economic evaluation of strategies for developing the traditional access network along a cost effective path toward a future-proof multiservice broadband network. A broad range of appropriate network alternatives have been assessed for each of five representative European upgrade cases. The technological options that have been evaluated range from conventional copper-based networks to emerging new technologies such as hybrid fiber coax networks and ATM-based broadband passive optical networks. The techno-economic assessment was carried out by the Eurescom P306 project \"Access network evolution and preparation for implementation\", using the methodology and tool developed within the RACE 2087/TITAN project. The scenarios studied include gradual provisioning, from 1995 to 2005, of services like POTS, N-ISDN, asymmetric switched broadband, symmetric switched broadband, and broadcast broadband. The demand forecasts for the selected bearer services are extracted from a European Delphi survey, also carried out within TITAN. The quality of the existing infrastructure, the average subscriber capacity demand, and demography are among the key elements likely to affect the economic viability of access network upgrade strategies.",

   "abstract": "The future belongs to the service providers who invest in new network architectures. Continuous innovation is easier, but the new architectures call for significantly different ways of running the telephone and cable businesses. The network architecture forms the main infrastructure to meet the enterprise networking needs of the next century. Today's telephone networks treat switching, transmission, and operations systems as distinct disciplines. The usually respectable tendency towards caution in adapting to change would suggest that new technologies be mapped into this methodology. This is not possible. The deployment of the telecommunications management network (TMN) illustrates the problem; it was so slow in coming due primarily to its complexity and the inertia of legacy systems. Distinctions between switching and transmission equipment disappear as network elements become software-based. Incorporating network management functions in the network elements can make operating a network easier. Only a radical change of mindset can hope to provide the necessary cost benefits and ease of use. The full-service network requires a new nodal architecture; one possibility is shown. A shared access infrastructure featuring a connection control layer connects network services and management to the modules which provide intelligent network capability, such as call setup, routers and transport. Connection control provides the pathways for a combination of these modules to work together to perform traditional network functions.",

   "abstract": "Although coaxial networks and hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) networks have been in use for delivering television programs to the home, their usage as access networks to provide broadband interactive data services (BIDS) to the home is very recent. In this article, the authors highlight the importance of managing the networking infrastructure for BIDS and explore the unique requirements and challenges in managing HFC networks. Considering the operational requirements of BIDS operators, network maintenance, subscriber support, and planning are identified as the three functional areas that a BIDS network management system must address. It is argued that management support built into BIDS equipment (e.g., cable modems, headend cable termination units, subscriber PCs) can provide a cost-effective way of monitoring the status and performance of HFC networks, and some initial experiences of implementing and deploying network monitors in a real-world BIDS system are presented.",

   "abstract": "The support of broadband multimedia applications over an enterprise network poses a broad range of networking challenges for efficient resource management, intelligent switching, and access control for distributed information. We propose two server-based scheduling algorithms, with low computational complexity, to guarantee multimedia information synchronization at the destination, with minimum presentation delays and buffer requirements. We outline a communication framework, highlighting the issues and challenges faced by today's enterprise networks to support multimedia services. We describe the proposed connection establishment and resource allocation schemes in resource-constrained enterprise networks. The objective is to manage the limited resources of the network for maximum utilization. Towards this end we present a dynamic capacity allocation scheme to support connections for multiple users. Specifically, we show that the channel capacity allocation problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming problem. This allocation scheme is implemented at each intermediate switch to dynamically determine the capacity allocation. The effects of interswitch rate mismatch and network delay offset scheduling have also been incorporated in the management framework. In addition, we introduce the concept of route selection based on the requested network quality of service.",

   "abstract": "The author proposes a view of modern networks as relationship management machines creating communities of people. He first reflects on the way in which economic analysis has approached the questions of organizations and relations. He tries to show that the rigid division of labor between micro economist and macro economist has left these issues in a no man's land until recently, when the transaction cost approach began to bridge the gap. The author therefore suggests directions in which this intellectual work may be pursued to its logical conclusions and sheds light on \"information infrastructures\". After presenting the three dimensions of contact, contract, and commitment, the author turns his attention to three large networks (in air transportation, banking, and capital markets, respectively) that are currently serving as \"information age infrastructures\". He tries to show that the way they fit in today's economy can only be understood fully by looking at them as \"linking machines\".",

This article focuses on the system/network supervision and operation and maintenance, which are of great importance for the success of the optical transport network. For a better understanding of these topics, it is necessary to derive a layered network model for the optical transport network and to make a workable definition of the term \"network transparency.\" The proposed operation and maintenance concept deals with the identification of its related functions, the supervision of the optical regenerators, the maintenance signals required for failure localization, and the difficulty of defining a suitable mechanism for performance monitoring in transparent networks. Appropriate realization aspects are discussed too. Possible solutions for failure detectors are described. For transferring the individual maintenance signals between the associated network elements, a communication channel with a suitable structure is proposed.",

The objective of these standards is to enable flexible design and interoperability of network elements for use in a global ATM network, independent of any specific implementation. This article discusses these standards with respect to their development and application in planning ATM networks. Specifically, it addresses the following: the modeling approach taken in the development of the ITU standards, key operational features specified in the ATM network element functional model, and the capabilities of the ATM network element management interface. Examples of ATM equipment are provided to illustrate how the functional models specified in the ITU standards may be used by network planners and equipment manufacturers to specify and develop ATM equipment tailored to specific needs, while ensuring network interoperability. The article concludes with some points on the future enhancement of these and related ATM equipment operations standards.",

Optical amplifiers compensate for propagation losses in long distance links and branching losses in access networks, at the same time avoiding costly two-way conversions between optical and electrical signals. The devices available up to now are mainly represented by rare-earth-doped active fiber optical amplifiers. This article presents the state-of-the-art of optical amplifiers for telecommunications. However, erbium-doped fibre amplifiers are having a strong impact on the telecommunication market, thanks to the excellent performance of commercial devices. They are widely employed in long distance networks for the third transmission window, which is centered at /spl lambda/=1550 nm, while in the second window, around /spl lambda/=1310 nm, the role of semiconductor optical amplifiers is still competitive.",

   "abstract": "We define an enterprise network (EN) broadly as follows: a corporate-wide network that ties together the communications, processing, and storage resources of the corporation, thereby making those resources available to users distributed throughout the corporation. Such a network typically contains both customer-owned elements and interpremises transport provided by a public network provider. This definition is intentionally broad enough to encompass the very different forms of past, present, and future ENs. As discussed subsequently, a more limited definition is often utilized that focuses on the EN in its currently common form as a local area network (LAN) internetwork. The EN construct has already provided a powerful capability for corporate distributed processing. As it continues to evolve, its importance and influence in corporate networking will continue to grow. A number of alternative paths for the future EN are identified, both at the architectural level and with respect to technology details. The key architectural issue is the degree to which the existing EN will evolve to the integrated EN. At the technology level, the most burning question is the future role of ATM, which at this stage can be viewed as either a technology that promises to integrate the networks used for all forms of communications, or a technology that is not optimal for any communication form, and is at best a compromise solution. In addition, there are still considerable uncertainties as to the future of DCE and other standard approaches to applications support, the degree to which virtual LANs will appear in the EN, the role of the bandwidth manager, and the replacement of today's dominant use of dedicated circuits in the interpremises network (IPN) by ring-based access networks and fast packet switching.",

   "abstract": "Presents an assessment of several existing medium access control (MAC) protocols in terms of four criteria: cyclicity/cycle gap, access mode, delay invulnerability, and prioritized access. From these protocols, we selected the adaptive cycle cell insertion (ACCI) mechanism as showing the most promise of satisfying these criteria and modeled our proposed prioritized ACCI (PACCI) protocol on its more desirable features. PACCI is suitable for client-server-based gigabit LANs and MANs. It provides fair access for regular nodes by means of regular cycles, and offers prioritized access to privileged nodes by means of restricted cycles. PACCI's bandwidth allocation for the regular and restricted cycles is then based on an analytic model in an attempt to guarantee QoS by maintaining throughput under diverse traffic loads. Our analysis considered throughput as a function of the restricted cycle/regular cycle ratio (RS/RG) and showed that as RS/RG grows, the throughput difference between privileged and regular nodes increases. Simulation results confirmed the accuracy of the analysis. We also found that the throughput and end-to-end delay are not dependent on the cycle ratio under light load conditions, but that as the network load increases, the benefit of having restricted cycles becomes evident. Simulation results also showed that PACCI assures minimal delay for privileged nodes while incurring reasonable performance degradation for regular nodes.",

It is generally agreed that the universal personal communication paradigm is the confluence of terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems. PCS users will neither know nor care if their calls are being carried by satellite or cellular. Unlike their terrestrial-based counterparts. The MSS, with their global blanket coverage, are truly able to realize the vision of communications from anywhere at any time for people on the move. The MSS are also being used in developing countries without existing wireline networks to provide rapid, ubiquitous telephone service. This article provides an overview of mobile satellite systems and concepts. The materials presented are geared toward a broad audience with engineering or management back grounds.",

   "abstract": "The available bit rate (ABR) service attracted much attention during the negotiations leading to Traffic Management Specification Version 4.0, finalized by the ATM Forum. In thr ABR service, feedback flow control of the source rate is provided in response to the changing asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-layer transfer characteristics. The reference behavior of the source end system, the destination end system, and the switch, as detailed in the specification, allows cooperative control among these systems. The performance of the public ABR service is discussed in connection with the evolution of ATM switches. Public networks with first-generation switches provide an ABR service with a limited peak cell rate (PCR), while those with second-generation switches can provide an ABR service with any PCR. In such networks, TCP-over-ABR works well. Point-to-multipoint ABR will be provided in advanced switches. A method is proposed for maintaining the throughput of point-to-multipoint ABR when the number of leaves is increased.",

   "abstract": "The author proposes a solution for the allocation and balancing of resources to maximize available bandwidth shared among corporate users. Currently established broadband virtual private networks (BVPNs) based on asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology comprise ATM cross-connects (ATM-CCs) and a lot of intelligent customer premises equipment (CPE). The CPE, an intelligent ATM service switcher or ATM multiplexer, enables the corporate user to connect routers, private branch exchanges (PBXs), or codecs onto the ATM network. One fundamental characteristic of CPE is that it is capable of accumulating asynchronous and synchronous traffic which may belong to different corporate users' sites. A typical example given of a BVPN configuration serving two corporate network users with four user sites each. In general, each user site needs to exchange asynchronous (connectionless) data streams for the inter-local area network (LAN) communication and synchronous (connection-oriented) data streams with constant bit rates for video/voice communication. The configuration and the performance aspects of inter-LAN communications employing a connectionless server (CLS) are discussed. The bandwidth allocation aspects of the BVPN having to convey synchronous and asynchronous traffic in an ATM environment without a CLS are discussed, including the bandwidth allocation algorithm. The important characteristics of the proposed algorithm is also summarised.",

The key element of this type of intelligent antenna system is an m/spl times/M switching matrix where m is the number of beams and M is the number of radio channel units. The system capacity is related to the complexity of the switching matrix. A 12-beam switched-beam antenna system can provide 100 percent capacity increase over a conventional three-sector (three-beam) antenna system.",

While the characteristics of such encoding algorithms depend on the nature of the image data, using enhanced MPEG-2 algorithms on SHD images can compress a 6 Gb/s original to 150 Mb/s with nearly no loss in quality.

It can make quantum leaps in both transmission capacity and cross-connect throughput simultaneously by exploiting WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) transmission and the wavelength routing capabilities of paths. Since the optical path is a new concept, new operation and management (OAM) systems and related technologies need to be developed before it can be fully utilized. This article discusses some of the key OAM-related issues and identifies the technical points necessary for future developments. The issues include optical path realization technologies, optical path accommodation design problems, a newly proposed optical transport network layer architecture, and the optical transport module for the network node interface.",

It examines issues to be considered when implementing object models in existing network elements (NEs). Methods are introduced through which the vendor- and operator-specific extensions necessary to control the complete set of functions of an exchange can be based on the existing Q3 models. All Q3 object models have in common that they provide an abstract management view of the exchange while hiding the specific technical implementation from the operator. In principle, this management view can be split into three different functional areas: subscriber management; traffic management; and management of other system internal resources.",

   "abstract": "The main goal of this article is to present the translation of quality of service (QoS) parameters between layers. The QoS parameters in the ATM layer and AAL are defined. This translation concept came from the QoS framework in which the influence of the protocol stack on the QoS should be considered. As an example, we concentrate on the translation from the AAL to the ATM layer, as the AAL must be designed to be service-dependent and specific. Translation, both taking the transport protocol into account as well as between application and transport QoS, needs further study. However, our study shows that the QoS translation is a possible and good approach in end-to-end QoS guarantees in the broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN). As far as the end-to-end QoS guarantee issue is concerned, the transport QoS requirements are specified in terms of bounds on transport QoS parameters. The bounds on transport QoS parameters will be translated into the bounds on ATM layer QoS parameters. The ATM-layer QoS parameters resulting from the translation will be the performance requirements on a connection basis for the ATM network, but are basically the end-to-end parameters, including the network and the end systems. Therefore, the QoS translation finally results in the network performance parameters in the ATM network. We define QoS parameters in the AAL and ATM layer. Case studies in which the translation method is applied to a constant bit rate (CBR) video service and data service, respectively, are also presented.",

   "abstract": "The the quality of service (QoS) concept is becoming an ever more important issue in telecommunication and computer communication. The article focuses on the QoS notion and concept. The definition of QoS in the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications Sector (ITU-T) recommendations and the International Standards Organization (ISO) standards is analysed. Little is known about the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) performance requirements of the broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN) services, especially for multimedia applications. This is because the ATM performance requirements of multimedia applications depend not only on the diverse QoS requirements from application and user, but also on the protocol stacks and scheduling in end systems. Therefore, in order to guarantee QoS to the user, it is necessary to introduce a set of QoS parameters whose properties indicate the nature and requirements of the layered protocol stack. We describe how a proposed QoS framework can be applied to B-ISDN as a specific network. The QoS aspects related to B-ISDN signaling (the control plane) and the QoS aspects related to layer and plane management (the management plane) are described. We also describe how the QoS framework resides in a protocol stack and works together with the B-ISDN network management and signaling.",

Although a lot of investigations have already been carried out, there remains a need to gain deeper insight into the complex mechanisms which govern radio propagation. The authors first present a summary of the propagation mechanisms and discuss some issues related to radio channel parameters and measurement techniques. Then a systematic description of the propagation and simulation models developed within various European projects is given. The survey focuses on the main features of these models and the rationale behind their elaboration.",

The authors provide an overview of the major areas in the security of enterprise networks to show the variety of issues and techniques developed to address them. Our focus is on the ideas behind these techniques, which can be combined in many ways to create solutions that apply to different situations. The following areas are covered: confidentiality, preventing the disclosure of transmitted data to unauthorized parties; integrity, detecting modification, insertion, deletion, or replay of transmitted data; data-origin authentication, demonstrating that the origin of transmitted data is as claimed; nonrepudiation, preventing either the sender or receiver in a communication from denying their participation; user authentication, demonstrating that the identity of a user or system is as claimed; and access control, guarding against unauthorized use of resources, including the use of resources in an improper manner. We also look at some of the considerations that come into play in designing security solutions for the enterprise networking environment.",

   "abstract": "Residential broadband networks present new signaling challenges as compared to the more traditional telephony networks. Access signaling protocols such as DSM-CC and Q.2931 for ATM, are evolving to meet these challenges. A desirable outcome will be a solution that supports seamless interworking among the newer video applications and the more traditional applications. First we examine the new requirements that arise when considering control of VDT networks. We then provide a brief review of the capabilities and development status of each protocol. Finally, we examine possible evolution paths for the development of broadband signaling. Our primary objective is to describe a signaling evolution path that integrates the requirements of both business and residential broadband networks, thus allowing partial or total sharing of network resources in support of both types of applications.",

A new transmission technology for this purpose is introduced-framed quadrature audio/data modulation (framed QADM)-in which voice and data channels are combined as an integral part of the modulation process. The basic technology is described and two implementations, which are at different levels of maturity for standardization within the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), are presented. Finally, system attributes are discussed for framed QADM as they compare to other technologies.",

The major modifications made during the redesign of Sockets are as follows: using an object-oriented design that facilitates the introduction of new communication service functions and simplifies use and learning; using a new generic communication model that supports a wide range of traditional and advanced communication services such as OSI, Internet, ISDN, and ATM services; using an abstract message-passing concept to transfer service data across the interface which enables operating systems to apply copy-avoiding mechanisms; supporting multipoint communications and enabling applications to distinguish different data streams; supporting direct forwarding of incoming data streams to outgoing streams to yield better performance; avoiding platform dependencies so as to reduce modification costs when porting applications.",

Yet an understanding of the taxonomy of technical standards, the value and relationship of the different fora developing standards, even the need for standards at all, remain elusive. With the global effect of the GIH, technical telecommunications standards are no longer a minor aspect of society. The International Telecommunications Union, as the leading telecommunications standards-making authority, in conjunction with the many other fora developing and contributing to telecommunications standards, needs to offer more than technical standards direction. The telecommunications standards-making community should add its own more considered view of the GIH to the current commentary from publications, politicians, and pundits.",

   "abstract": "The continued rapid progress in the deployment of fiber optics communications has led to widespread interest in employing photonics to implement switching functions, hitherto reserved for electronics. Significant research effort has been devoted to this, and different specialized concepts have been suggested and partly demonstrated, albeit not in the field. At the same time, mainstream research and development in the area of telecommunications switching is solidly based on electronics. In this article we first give a short introduction to photonic switching. We then discuss generic switching functions in telecommunications networks with a view of the possible role of photonics, and discuss the implementation of the switching functions from a photonics and electronics point of view. We then apply this reasoning to look at scaling and transparency of all-optical networks based on our current research.",

Electronic bonding refers to the use of TMN-based protocols for the exchange of information between service providers. This is one of the first major deployments of TMN in the U.S. telecommunications network. As was learned during this process, the development of standards is only a starting point. Many additional agreements and decisions must be made in order to achieve deployment of TMN-based interfaces.",

   "abstract": "As service providers introduce asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) into their networks, they are faced with the issue of technology interworking: for a given service, can a customer who has an ATM user-network interface (UNI) communicate with a customer who does not have an ATM UNI? For switched multimegabit data service (SMDS), technology interworking is well defined. In fact, SMDS is supported by several technology platforms that can interwork with each other. The three major platforms which support SMDS are: a frame-based platform based on the SMDS data exchange interface (DXI), a cell-based platform based on the IEEE 802.6-1990 standard, and a cell-based platform based on ATM. This article examines how SMDS is supported by each of these platforms and how these platforms interwork. Furthermore, this article presents how the major interworking functions required for these platforms appear to be straightforward for suppliers to implement,.",

Accordingly, all public telecommunication services are exploited by the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Telebras). Telebras is the holding company of the so-called Sistema Telebras (Telebras System) consisting of 27 state based operating companies (OCs) and of EMBRATEL (Brazilian Telecom Enterprise), in charge of interstate connections and of the international gateway. The Federal law of 1972 that created Telebras also granted it power to exploit the services through its controlled or associate companies. Telebras owns over 97 percent of all telephone lines in the country. The remaining 3 percent are exploited by a private company (an exception foreseen in the Constitution) and two municipal companies. The newly inaugurated federal administration has submitted to the Congress a revised institutional model for the country, which includes the breakup of the state monopoly in telecommunications. The article discusses particularities regarding the future trends of the new approach to be enforced for the exploitation of telecommunication services and technology, and the evolution of the country's telecommunication networks.",

   "abstract": "This article considers past and present European research into communications characteristics for transport telematics applications. The background for the work is derived from the European Commission's DRIVE/Transport Telematics programs and research projects, and CEN TC278 activities. The prospect that a single media cannot meet all the current applications requirements is supported by consideration of key services that have different communications requirements. However, media selection minimization and a migration path for homogeneous implementation of current research solutions are expostulated. The article concludes by questioning a defaulting media selection against our social consciences for matching media to requirements. The article is aimed at a readership with some technical knowledge and should be of interest to transport authorities and manufacturers intending to tackle the problems of implementing transport telematics systems.",

   "abstract": "In 1992 five narrowband frequency pairs in the 220-222 MHz band were allocated for intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. These allocations are capable of supporting low-rate digital communications (4-30 kb/s). This article examines potential applications within the ITS program which can effectively use the low data rate that these allocations can provide. An overview of the narrowband wireless data communication challenges and the communication theoretic techniques likely to be employed on high-performance modems is provided. An experimental system was built, and preliminary field test results are presented which demonstrate that spectral efficiencies in excess of 3 b/s/Hz are achievable in practical modems.",

H.324 was designed, above all, to provide the best possible performance (video and audio quality, delay, etc.) on low-bit-rate networks. This article covers the H.324 system and its component standards, including the V.34 modem, H.223 multiplexer, H.245 control protocol, G.723.1 audio coder, and H.263 video coder. Call setup procedures and optional features like encryption and data application protocols are also described. The standard should ensure interoperability among a diverse variety of H.324 terminals, including PC-based multimedia videoconferencing systems, voice/data modems, encrypted telephones, World Wide Web browsers with live video. Remote security cameras. and standalone videophones. Products compliant with H.324 should all interoperate with each other and, through appropriate gateways, with ITU-T H-series terminals on ISDN, LANs, and ATM/B-ISDN networks.",

   "abstract": "Broadcast television in the United States has remained essentially unchanged in the last 50 years except for the addition of color and stereo sound. Today, personal computers are meeting the need for random access of high-resolution images and CD-quality audio. Furthermore, advances in digital video compression and digital communication technology have cleared the way toward offering high-resolution video and audio services to consumers using traditional analog communications channels. In 1987, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chartered an advisory committee to recommend an advanced television system for the United States. From 1990 to 1992, the Advanced Television Test Center (ATTC) tested four all-digital systems, one analog high-definition television (HDTV) system, and one enhancement NTSC system using broadcast and cable television environment simulators. The formation of the HDTV Grand Alliance in May 1993 resulted from the withdrawal of the only analog HDN system from the competition and a stalemate between the other four all-digital systems. The HDTV Grand Alliance system is composed of the best components from previously competing digital systems demonstrated to the FCC. The Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG-2) syntax is used with novel encoding techniques to deliver a set of video scanning formats for a variety of applications. This article describes the important features and concepts embodied in the HDTV Grand Alliance system.",

   "abstract": "The Internet in Brazil is experiencing explosive growth. Spawned by a newsmedia-driven public interest which began in early 1994, this growth has taken unique paths. In a country where the entire data communications and telephone services infrastructure is under a state monopoly, Internet services to final users are scattered through hundreds of private providers of all sizes, while Internet backbones operated by transnational companies are being installed to compete with a state-funded backbone and a state-owned backbone. This article describes nongovernmental networking activity and how it evolved from a purely academic network to one serving a much larger public.",

   "abstract": "There is rapidly increasing demand for very-high-performance networked communication for workstation clusters, distributed databases, multiprocessors, industrial data acquisition and control systems, shared access to distributed data, and so on. Higher-bandwidth hardware using the traditional protocols is not sufficient. Even at 100 Mb/s, and certainly at 250 Mb/s, throughput for many applications is so limited by delays due to architecturally induced inefficiencies, such as software overheads (often hundreds of microseconds), that higher bandwidth generally raises cost without improving performance. A new approach to communication is required, one that can eliminate the delay due to software overheads, if we are to reap the full benefit of the far higher bandwidths that modern hardware can provide. The SCI solves this problem by using the distributed-shared-memory paradigm, typically offering submicrosecond delays and bandwidths currently in the range of 1250 to 8000 Mb/s per network node. The article first reviews the general properties that an appropriate system architecture should have, and introduces an architectural model, the local area multiprocessor, distinguished by its shared-memory performance and its ability to handle LAN-style distances. These desired properties are then considered in more detail, and practical design decisions are made, illustrated by the evolution of the ISO/ANSI/IEEE standard Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) as it addressed these issues. Finally, the current status of the various SCI follow-on and support projects is reported.",

   "abstract": "TINA, the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture, is a software architecture for services provided on public and private networks. TINA NRIM adds on the existing concepts and supports a host of new multimedia services that can not be supported by the existing information models. It is expected that network information models will be aligned with those defined by ATM Forum and ITU-T SG15. The authors show a generic information model of network resources, which can be applied to different network technologies. The model contains a number of abstraction levels of network resources. The highest level of abstraction, which is offered at the interface between the network resources and services levels, is defined in terms of a connection graph. The connection graph is an abstract representation of resources describing the connectivity between stream interfaces (media flows). This graph can be used to specify end-to-end connectivity that spans through several layer networks. Thus, a line in the connection graph can be supported by a sequence of trails. The trail, in its turn, consists of subnetwork connections and/or tandem connections. The generic information model with appertained abstraction levels is very well suited to the TINA connection management architecture.",

It consists of a ring of undersea cables connecting six network nodes at six cable landing sites. The TPC-5 CN brings together a unique blend of technology to achieve the architectural robustness and transmission performance needed by network users. Among the technologies used in the TPC-5 CN are erbium doped fiber optical amplifiers (EDFAs), 5 Gb/s line terminating equipment (LTE), line monitoring equipment (LME), synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) STM-16 add/drop multiplexers (ADMs) with four-fiber-ring automatic protection switching capability, and network management equipment (NME). The article describes the operation of each of these technology and how this equipment is collectively integrated to achieve the performance and functionality of the TPC-5 CN.",

   "abstract": "As the PC entered its second decade of evolution, it started a transformation into a general-purpose communication tool. This article takes a look at a number of established and emerging technologies that contribute to this ongoing transformation of the PC. Although each of these technologies individually is perfectly capable of enabling compelling PC applications in specific market segments, it is their use in combination that potentially supports the most useful real-world communications applications. The ability of an applications program to use seemingly independent technologies in concert is no coincidence, but requires proper upfront consideration and careful design. This article presents technologies and common interfaces promoted by Intel for the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Although several alternative solutions exist and are promoted by others, none of them offer the degree of interworking needed to make the \"communicating PC\" a coherent entity. We start by taking a look at the PC's role in computer telephony integration (CTI) and go on to consider call processing, protocol-independent data transport, simultaneous voice/data communication, unattended PC operation, plug and play CTI peripherals and mainstream implementations.",

This design approach brings down the cost and may find a wider scope of application in the future. Our research focuses on the underlying software architecture for video library services. We assume the existence of an adequate operating system (OS), network and disk support. We survey related VOD research, introduce services supporting video library, and cover the system architecture and design. We discuss the architecture of our video library server and clients; describe our system implementation, and examine future directions.",

Put simply, VICS is based on drivers' arbitrary selection of routes and on the automobile's unique ability to take any desired route. The objective is to promote the safe, smooth flow of traffic by naturally distributing the flow of traffic, which is done by guiding cars to the appropriate routes in accordance with drivers' instinctive desire to reach their destinations quickly by avoiding traffic congestion. VICS distributes road traffic information such as traffic jams or accidents to drivers in real time, and stimulates drivers for accurate and proper utilization.",

Therefore, one- and two-way communication systems have been investigated for their specific advantages in the improvement of driver information, safety, and traffic flow. The possibilities of various cellular communications systems are presented. Autonomous in-car navigation systems have reached marketability, and are able to perform static route guidance for drivers. These systems can be improved by giving them a knowledge of the current traffic situation to enable dynamic route guidance. This information can be transmitted via different communication systems, which are discussed.",

As smaller cells are deployed to meet the demands for increased capacity, the number of cell boundary crossings increases. The author presents an overview of published work on handover performance and control and discusses current trends in handover research. He discusses investigations that are applicable to a single tier of cells. He focuses on macrocells, but includes a brief discussion on how things change as cell sizes shrink. By assuming an overlay of macrocells and microcells he summarizes issues and approaches unique to such systems.",

   "abstract": "The author identifies eight application scenarios for voice over ATM, and evaluates alternatives for implementing the required network functionality. For single voice calls this involves evaluation of adaptation type, QoS, echo canceller deployment, and use of partially filled cells. For a multiplex of at least three to six voice calls it involves evaluation of the structured data transport option in AAL1, interworking with DSn/En for fault management and QoS. These issues determine choices for network users plus implementation priorities for network operators.",

   "abstract": "The answers to many of the communications problems businesses face lie in the integration of telephony, data collaboration, and video communications with the desktop computer, doing it inexpensively, doing it seamlessly with the local area and wide area networks. The adoption of isochronous Ethernet (isoEthernet) by the IEEE 802.9 committee as the new multimedia standard in LANs has given rise to new technology that converges voice, collaborative video, and data at the desktop. The official name for isoEthernet is ISLAN16-T, and it is sponsored by the IEEE 802.9 committee. IEEE 802.9a, the document specifying the isoEthernet standard, became an official standard at the end of 1995. The intent behind the ISLAN16-T standard is to define a LAN transport capable of handling synchronous services such as voice and video while retaining compatibility with 10Base-T. ISLAN16-T opens the door to a multitude of new applications that can reshape work and communications habits to make businesses more productive, responsive, and profitable.",

   "abstract": "This article describes a wideband spread code-division multiple access (W-CDMA) system for high-capacity and high-quality personal radio communication. This system has been authorized as an EIA/TIA Interim Standard IS-665, T1P1 Trial Use Standard J-STD-015, and ITU-R Recommendation M 1073. The system uses wideband spreading to accomplish good interference immunity, high-quality speech, and high-speed data transmission. The system uses coherent detection (CD) and an interference canceller system (ICS) to enhance the capacity. The CD and ICS use continuous pilot signals in the forward/reverse links to estimate the propagation path parameters. PN and Hadamard sequences are used as the spreading code for minimal mutual interference between traffic and pilot/sync/paging channels. A robust 32 kb/s waveform speech coder, ITU-T COM101+, has been developed to achieve toll-quality speech in the radio environment. This system provides up to 128 voice channels per cell and data transmission up to 64 kb/s by 5 MHz spreading. Unification of low- and high-mobility applications and reduced complexity of system and hardware configurations are accomplished.",

   "abstract": "The emerging widespread use of wireless LAN systems together with the users' desire for such systems to interoperate has created a requirement for standards. Many standards bodies are currently defining standards for wireless systems that relate to different layers of the networking protocol stack. Of these, two influential physical and data link layer standards, IEEE 802.11 and the European HIPERLAN, are described. The article then considers the network layer by discussing extensions that are being made to the widely used Internet protocol (IP) to deal with mobility (wired or wireless). The final standards that are discussed relate to wireless link management. The article concludes by speculating on future directions for wireless LAN systems.",
