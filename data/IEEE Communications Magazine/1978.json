      "abstract": "In a little over ten years, lightwave communication using optical fibers has progressed from a laboratory proposal to a near commercial reality. Losses in optical fiber waveguides have been reduced from hundreds of dB/Km in the early seventies to less than 1 dB/km at some wavelengths today. Bandwidths of multimode fibers can now exceed 1 GHz in km lengths. Strengths in kilometer length fibers have been increased to hundreds of KPSI (more than steel). Cables containing hundreds of fibers, multiple fiber splices, and single fiber connectors have been developed. Lasers which had lifetimes measured in minutes or hours in the early seventies now have extrapolated lifetimes of over a million hours. New material systems which can use the lower loss longer wavelength regions of the optical spectrum are evolving. Meanwhile, prototype systems carrying voice, data, and video services have been placed in service for commercial telephone and military applications. We can anticipate the widespread use of optical fibers on a routine basis beginning in the early eighties. Along with this will come reduced costs for existing services and the introduction of new services made more economical by this new transmission medium.",

This application of a well-understood theory as a viable alternative is largely due to the availability of low cost arithmetic and storage LSI circuits; the availability of low cost A/D and D/A circuits; the commonplace occurrence of digital signals due to the ever increasing use of digital transmission and routing; and the significant advantages offered by the flexibility of the digital approach. This paper is an attempt to present in an introductory manner the what, why, where, and how of digital signal processing.",

      "abstract": "Data communication has grown dramatically in the past two decades, both in technical sophistication and in usage. While channels and networks designed expressly for data use have emerged, the voiceband channels of the telephone network continue to be the major transmission medium; data sets, or modems, play a role analogous to that of the telephone in voice communication. Fundamental developments such as adaptive equalization along with bandwidth-conserving signal formats have allowed the modem to better match the characteristics of the analog channel, resulting in increased available throughput. The quest for further improvements, along with elegant implementations and attractive user features, provide a continuing challenge to communication engineers. When the need arose to communicate digital data at transmission rates substantially higher than telegraph speeds, first for defense about mid-century and then for industry in the late 1950's, all the ingredients required for successful implementation were at hand. Decades earlier, Nyquist had formulated the filtering or band shaping requirements to allow the independent transmission of a sequence of signal samples. Just prior to mid-century, Shannon had published his celebrated information theory, which showed engineers the maximum rate at which they could signal through a channel if only they were clever enough. The telephone network, especially in the United States, had reached a high state of development and widespread accessibility; it seemed like an ideal vehicle to carry the new data communication traffic.",

      "abstract": "Because of the continuing demand for more telecommunication capacity, to serve the world's need for commerce and public safety, there is a continuing need for more efficient ways of sharing the radio spectrum. The conventional way of allocating the spectrum is by frequency division; however, for many kinds of services this is inefficient. Hence, it seems desirable to reexamine whether alternative procedures might not be necessary if the benefits of telecommunications are to be assured in the face of increased demand. Spreadspectrum techniques, which are based on principles antithetic to those currently used in spectrum allocation for reducing necessary bandwidth, seem to offer benefits for spectrum sharing, for some applications, superior to those of frequency division. This paper provides a tutorial summary of some of the principles upon which spread-spectrum systems have developed. It is hoped the reader might consider what role such techniques may play in future spectrum sharing and allocation opportunities.",

Following a brief historical perspective, the current and projected system configurations are described with emphasis on the operational characteristics of transmitting station equipment. The Omega positionfixing process is examined and the available user equipment is reviewed. The characteristics of VLF radio wave propagation, which have a significant impact on Omega navigation accuracy, are discussed. Finally, the various elements of the Omega user community are described along with the likely nature of future increased applications of the Omega navigation system.",

      "abstract": "The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was approved as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) by the Secretary of Commerce on November 23, 1976. This Standard was developed as a part of the Computer Security Program within the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). This paper places this standard in perspective with other computer security measures that can and should be applied to Federal computer systems either before or coincident to using the Data Encryption Standard. In 1972, NBS initiated the standards development effort leading to adoption of the DES. During this period, NBS solicited for algorithms and information upon which a standard could be based, published for comment the algorithm which best satisfied the requirements of an encryption standard, and coordinated the effort with both the potential using communities and supplying communities. This paper outlines the environment surrounding and the history of the Data Encryption Standard and discusses the objectives of additional standards to be developed within the computer security program.",
