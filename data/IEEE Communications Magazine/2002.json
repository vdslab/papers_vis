At the same time, service provider models are established and services designed to span physical networks irrespective of the access method used. To provide an infrastructure-independent access to services and applications for highly mobile users (e.g., in cars), we present a communication gateway architecture as an important component of fourth generation wireless communication systems. We especially emphasize the role of digital broadcast networks for future mobile networking.",

      "abstract": "A number of active queue management algorithms for TCP/IP networks such as random early detection (RED), stabilized RED (SRED), BLUE, and dynamic RED (DRED) have been proposed in the past few years. This article presents a comparative study of these algorithms using simulations. The evaluation is done using the OPNET Modeler, which provides a convenient and easy-to-use platform for simulating large-scale networks. The performance metrics used in the study are queue size, packet drop probability, and packet loss rate. The study shows that, among the four algorithms, SIZED and DRED are more effective at stabilizing the queue size and controlling the packet loss rate while maintaining high link utilization. The benefits of stabilized queues in a network are high resource utilization, bounded delays, more certain buffer provisioning, and,traffic-load-independent network performance in terms of traffic intensity and number of TCP connections.",

Standards include HIPERLAN/2, defined by ETSI BRAN, 802.11a, defined by the IEEE, and HiSWANa defined by MMAC. These systems provide channel adaptive data rates up to 54 Mb/s (in a 20 MHz channel spacing) in the 5 GHz radio band. An overview of the HIPERLAN/2 and 802.11a standards is presented together with software simulated physical layer performance results for each of the defined transmission modes. Furthermore, the differences between these two standards are highlighted (packet size, upper protocol layers etc.), and the effects of these differences on throughput are analyzed and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Increasing demand for high-performance 4G broadband wireless is enabled by the use of multiple antennas at both base station and subscriber ends. Multiple antenna technologies enable high capacities suited for Internet and multimedia services, and also dramatically increase range and reliability. In this article we describe a multiple-input multiple-output OFDM wireless communication system, lab test results, and field test results obtained in San Jose, California. These are the first MIMO system field tests to establish the performance of MIMO communication systems.

      "abstract": "This article proposes a framework for establishing secure download for software-defined radio (SDR) that follows the current recommendations of SDR-related organizations, and can be employed in a variety of SDR architectures. The main goals of the security system are verification of the declared identity of the source that produces the software to be downloaded, control and verification of integrity of the downloaded data, disabling of the ability to run unauthorized software on the software-defined terminal, and secrecy of the transmitted data to prevent problems such as loss of intellectual property contained in the software. The system includes the following parties: manufacturers of the terminal hardware and software; government authorities relevant for SDR and users of SDR terminals. The underlying ideas for system development include employment of four different cryptographic techniques and tamper-resistant hardware. The cryptographic techniques employed are a secret key encryption technique, a public key encryption technique, a technique for cryptographic hashing, and a technique for digital signature. An important feature of the system is that it provides the possibility to exchange cryptographic components in an automatic manner. The proposed system is flexible, highly secure to protect both users and manufacturers, and provides a framework for the secure commercial implementation of SDR.",

      "abstract": "In this article a framework for end-to-end service-guaranteed shared protection in dynamic wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) mesh networks, called short leap shared protection (SLSP), is introduced. The idea of SLSP is to divide each working path into several overlapped protection domains, each of which contains a working and protection path pair. In addition to a guaranteed restoration service, SLSP is designed to satisfy the future requirements of wavelength-routed optical mesh networks in scalability, class of service, and capacity efficiency. Tutorial-like discussions are given in the architecture design and signaling mechanisms for implementing the SLSP framework in a dynamic network environment with examples and illustrations. To show that SLSP can improve capacity efficiency, simulations are conducted using four networks (22-, 30-, 79-, 100-node) for a comparative study between ordinary shared protection schemes and SLSP.",

      "abstract": "In QoS routing, paths for flows are selected based on knowledge of resource availability at network nodes and the QoS requirements of flows. Several QoS routing schemes have been proposed that differ in the way they gather information about the network state and select paths based on this information. We broadly categorize these schemes into best path routing and proportional routing. The best path routing schemes gather global network state information and always select the best path for an incoming I-low,based on this global view. It has been shown that best path routing schemes require frequent exchange of network state, imposing both communication overhead on the network and processing overheads on the core routers. On the other hand, proportional routing schemes proportion incoming flows among a set of candidate paths. We have shown that it is possible to compute near-optimal proportions using only locally collected information. Furthermore, a few good candidate paths can be selected using infrequently exchanged global information and thus with minimal communication overhead. We describe these schemes in detail and demonstrate that proportional routing schemes can achieve higher throughput with lower overhead than best path routing schemes.",

Therefore, the Internet must overcome these challenges and bottlenecks to provide more multimedia-oriented applications. We study the transmission of MPEG-4-based video traffic in MPLS networks, and propose a better architecture, called actively reserved bandwidth architecture, for improving CR-LDP in MPLS networks. The architecture is designed to overcome the bottleneck of router in MPLS networks. This approach is beneficial to the transmission of MPEG-4-based video traffic.",

      "abstract": "Path selection has long been one of the most important issues in the network design and management, which is also referred to as routing and wavelength assignment in the optical network domain. In this article we investigate the RWA problem for dynamic wavelength-routed mesh networks in a fully distributed controlled environment. We present a novel routing and signaling protocol called Asynchronous Criticality Avoidance (ACA), which is devised to reduce the mutual interference between lightpaths launched by different source-destination pairs to improve network performance in terms of blocking probability. With the fixed alternate routing architecture, the ACA protocol dynamically marks a set of wavelength channels as critical if the occupancy of the channels causes a bottleneck between an S-D pair with a width equal to or narrower than a predefined threshold. To support a distributed control environment, a suite of signaling processes is devised to realize the criticality avoidance mechanism, with which a two-stage routing and wavelength assignment (or criticality avoidance routing) is performed. The ACA protocol has been shown by simulations to be capable of better performance than existing schemes.",

We first present network service provider (NSP) billing models and how NSPs provision their networks. We then analyze causes of QoS-related problems, and describe a practical approach for providing QoS. This approach makes use of good network design, differentiated services, traffic protection, traffic engineering, and traffic management techniques. The relative importance of these techniques is pointed out. Although this approach largely focuses on issues within a single NSP domain, if multiple NSPs adopt such an approach (or a similar approach), interdomain QoS can also be provided.",

      "abstract": "All critical elements now exist for implementing a QoS-enabled IP network. It can be built on commercially available platforms and then evolve by adopting emerging standards and technologies. This article describes a practical architecture for end-to-end QoS in an IP environment including incorporation of established, as well as developing, IP and QoS technologies. The article combines the IETF QoS mechanisms with the LAN aspects of QoS and QoS for VoIP-areas usually considered separately. Proposed solutions span across different technologies, e.g., preservation of IP-based classification in MPLS headers, identification of flows encrypted within IPSec during WAN handling, traffic shaping in the access to enable grooming diverse applications and VPNs in the WAN, and so on. VoIP receives special emphasis because of its unique features, such as call setup signaling and call admission control, rarely addressed in traditional IP QoS discussions. An attractive scenario for the IP QoS implementation is to provide a multiservice environment between large enterprise premises over a service provider's core network. A successful end-to-end realization of this service presumes well-defined interworking between the SP's and customers' networks. It will take place on several levels including IP signaling, VoIP setup and CAC, policy interworking, and exchange of billing information. The article recommends to establish SP's presence at the enterprise premises and to implement interworking entities such as the proposed QoS customer server and QoS network server.",

This article highlights the issues relevant to mesh optical resilience and the challenges of meeting the myriad requirements. A series of Hamiltonian cycle-based solutions with different efficiency, complexity, and scalability trade-offs are introduced. Solutions for moderate-sized and large networks are differentiated with the former emphasizing simplicity and efficiency, and the latter stressing resilience from multiple simultaneous failures and isolation of failure events.",

For the time being, both single-carrier modulation and multicarrier modulation schemes have been proposed for standardization. VDSL is an enabling and cost-effective access solution for the last mile of the network over ordinary existing telephone lines. This new standard targets aggregated data rates up to 52 Mb/s on short loops. VDSL can be used to provision broadband services for both residential and business.",

Currently, chip rate processing is implemented using FPGA and ASIC technology. The use of a digital signal processor is explored for UTRA FDD systems with the goal of reducing cost and increasing flexibility. By combining chip rate and symbol rate processing within a single platform and taking advantage of the natural capacity of the air interface, load balancing can be performed, which reduces the amount of processing power needed, thereby reducing the cost of the receiver.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of QoS-aware group applications over the Internet has accelerated the need for scalable and efficient multicast support. We present a multicast \"life cycle\" model that identifies the various issues involved in a typical multicast session. During the life cycle of a multicast session, three important events can occur: group dynamics, network dynamics, and traffic dynamics. The first two aspects are concerned with maintaining a good-quality (e.g., cost) multicast tree taking into account member join/leave and changes in the network topology due to link/node failures/additions, respectively. The third aspect is concerned with flow, congestion, and error control. We examine various issues and solutions for managing group dynamics and failure handling in QoS multicasting, and outline several future research directions.",

      "abstract": "While deployment of new network technologies has not been steady over the years, it is useful to take a long-term view of how major new telecommunications infrastructures evolve. Since the beginning of this decade, we have witnessed the emergence of new generations of three major communication networks. This article addresses the market conditions, technology innovations, and services driving the need for intelligent all-optical, 3G wireless, and QoS-based packet networks. Market forces such as traffic and subscriber growth, equipment cost reduction, and new technology penetration have a deep impact on network buildouts. Technology innovations abound, especially in the optical domain. For example, Raman amplification, pure optical switches, and tunable lasers have had a major impact on the architecture of optical networks. Many key services, such as streaming audio and high-quality image transfer, were not possible using wireless access because of its limited bandwidth and performance. With 3G wireless technology, a true mobile Internet will become a reality. Businesses have shied away from the use of the public Internet because of service quality. Thanks to advances in MPLS and service intelligence, this is expected to change. For each type of network, we survey the key factors shaping its evolution and implications on network architectures.",

For ease of deployment, it is crucial to provide application-level support for transparent roaming and ubiquitous service access. We discuss how to develop such a service infrastructure integrating a variety of telephony arid data services spanning diverse access networks reaching heterogeneous end devices. We describe our techniques for achieving goals of transparent network- and device-independent service access, as well as scalable and fault-tolerant access to composed service entities across the wide area using self-adaptive data paths. We evaluate our implementation through applications that require adaptation to end devices and resource variations. The applications include Universal Inbox, Interactive Voice Room Control, MP3 Jukebox access using a cell phone, and real-time video delivery to wireless clients.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation networks (NGN) is a new concept commonly used by network designers to depict their vision of future telecommunications networks. However, various views on NGN have been expressed so far by operators, manufacturers, and service providers, and the general wish is now to come to a common understanding on NGN and to prepare standards on it. This is the reason why the ITU-T has decided to start the standardization process on NGN under the form of a new ITU-T Project prepared by Study Group 13. This new Project is in line with results from the existing ITU-T Project on Global Information Infrastructure (GII) because NGN is seen as a concrete realization of the GII. The NGN 2004 Project is a coordination structure led by Study Group 13, with the role of organizing studies on NGN in ITU-T. The target for the NGN 2004 Project is to prepare Recommendations in 2004.",

      "abstract": "Link adaptation techniques, where the modulation, coding rate, and/or other signal transmission parameters are dynamically adapted to the changing channel conditions, have emerged as powerful tools for increasing the data rate and spectral efficiency of wireless data-centric networks. While there has been significant progress on understanding the theoretical aspects of time adaptation in LA protocols, new challenges surface when dynamic transmission techniques are employed in broadband wireless networks with multiple signaling dimensions. Those additional dimensions are mainly frequency, especially in multicarrier systems, and space in multiple-antenna systems, particularly multiarray multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. We give an overview of the challenges and promises of link adaptation in future broadband wireless networks. We suggest guidelines to help in the design of robust, complexity/cost-effective algorithms for these future wireless networks.",

      "abstract": "Rapid technological developments are taking place in computing and telecommunications that provide a wide range of opportunities for the delivery of new advanced multimedia services (telematic services). In this context information networking has a central role, and telecommunications service engineering emerges as an important new scientific discipline. This article examines important issues that underpin the creation of telematic services in a highly competitive environment of service provisioning. The starting point is the proposal of a telecommunications service engineering framework consisting of a service development methodology, a service creation environment, and a service support environment, that considers telematic services as distributed object-oriented applications operating on distributed object platforms. Then the article focuses on the presentation and examination of a complete methodology for the development of telematic services, that \"covers\" in a systematic and structured manner the entire service creation process. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated by applying it to the design and development of a complex representative telematic service.",

Prior to detection, the input signal is whitened according to the reciprocal of an interfering spectrum, I(z)=1/AG(z). Next, in force of the maximum likelihood (ML) principle, the replica of signal is carried through the same filter, I(z), to match it to a new signal shape. Results of simulation show a significant gain in comparison to conventional single-matched detection.",

      "abstract": "Bluetooth is a method for data communication that uses short-range radio links to replace cables between computers and their connected units. Industry-wide Bluetooth promises very substantial benefits for wireless network operators, end workers, and content developers of exciting new applications. This article delves into the implementation and architecture of Bluetooth. It also describes the functional overview and applications of Bluetooth, and deals with the development of a model for recording, printing, monitoring, and controlling of eight process variables at the same time, using a distributed control system. We explain industrial automation via Bluetooth using IISS. Industrial automation is one of the major applications of Bluetooth technology. Industrial automation, in terms of controlling or monitoring a factory, office, or industrial process, means to install machines that can do the work instead of human workers. Industrial plants consists of many devices interconnected in different ways ranging from simple data collection units (I/O) to more intelligent devices such as sensors, one-loop controllers, or programmable controllers, and a supervisory system used as a human-machine interface (HMI) for data logging and supervisory control. An IISS is a controlling device that monitors the devices in a company. It basically communicates via the interface card in the PC; the hardware is connected parallel across the device, and it is interfaced with the PC via a transceiver. The device can be accessed both manually via the switches and remotely via the PC. A simulation of connecting a PC with the machines in a company was executed. Also, we wrote a software program using C language; we will show how the remote monitoring takes place between the control room and the PC. These details in the article establish the growing need for Bluetooth technology.",

In the United States over five million homes connect to the Internet using DOCSIS cable modems. We describe an evolution path to enhance the HFC plant to provide, initially, Gigabit Ethernet (and eventually multi-Gigabit Ethernet) on the trunk and feeder portions, and 100 Mb/s Ethernet on the subscriber drops. This next-generation HFC network will enable cable service providers to address the vast and underserved small and medium-sized business market, as well as offer emerging applications and services to the residential market.",

A conclusion that today's Internet represents about 0.1 percent of the deployment of a national petabit per second capacity broadband packet network, and that we have moved roughly halfway through the development and deployment timeline is developed. Along the way, the author gives his personal perspective on the development of, and the researchers who developed, technologies like packet voice, Ethernet bridging, ATM, the CNRI gigabit testbeds, and local ATM.

      "abstract": "Broadband wireless access is the most challenging segment of the wireless revolution since it has to demonstrate a viable alternative to the cable modem and DSL technologies that are strongly entrenched in the last mile access environment. The Analysis, Research, and Consultancy (ARC) Group forecasts that the fixed wireless deployments in both homes and businesses will reach almost 28 million by 2005, with North America and Western Europe accounting for 24 percent and 27 percent of these, respectively. Whether the promise of BWA will materialize depends on its appeal to telecom operators from the perspective of deployment economics, where the critical factor is the ease of installation of broadband wireless subscriber units. This ultimately leads to nonprofessional installation of integrated all-indoor BWSUs. Consequently the physical layer (PHY) has to mitigate the very tough impairments that characterize these non-line-of-sight environments. In this context we overview the work of the one of the IEEE 802.16 standard subcommittee projects that deals with a BWA solution based on OFDM access (OFDMA) aiming at the most challenging NLOS scenarios.",

To deliver reliable service, however, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection for the traffic carried on the label switched paths. We propose a path protection mechanism that is simple, scalable, fast, and efficient. We describe in detail our design considerations, the communication of fault information to appropriate switching elements, and the fault detection protocol. In particular, we propose a reverse notification tree structure for efficient and fast distribution of fault notification messages.",

      "abstract": "We discuss the design of a multicast event distribution service intended to support extremely large-scale event distribution. To date, event notification services have been limited in their scope due to limitations of the infrastructure. At the same time, Internet network and transport layer multicast services have seen limited deployment due to lack of user demand (with the exception of streaming services, e.g., on Sprint's US core network and in the Internet II). Research in active networks and reflective middleware suggests a way to resolve these two problems at one go. The goal of this article is to describe a reflective middleware system that integrates the network, transport, and distributed middleware services into a seamless whole. The system integrates this \"low-level\" technology into an event middleware system, suitable for telemetry, novel mobile network services, and other as yet unforeseen applications.",

The framework is based on the paradigm of service classes, wherein each class can exhibit a characteristic behavior in terms of resource allocation over the air interface. Using this QoS framework, future wireless network operators can define their own sets of service classes, choose the preferred way of implementing the QoS behavior of these classes, and offer class-based pricing schemes. The user application can choose the service class that best suits its expectations in terms of QoS and cost of access. A class-based bandwidth scheduling scheme is described as a mechanism to implement this QoS framework over CDMA air interfaces. This scheme incorporates the paradigm of service classes, in conjunction with fair resource allocation and air interface congestion resilience, while allocating air interface bandwidth to mobile users.",

A survey of the development of telephone channel modems, where the capacity is practically achieved, is presented. As a contrast, an account of multi-antenna systems is included, where a long journey to achieve capacity has just begun. A very important characteristic of multi-antenna systems is stressed: the capacity increases almost linearly with respect to the transmitted power as the number of antennas increases, keeping the corresponding bandwidth constant.",

Extruded subnets are designed to completely hide the fact that they are remote. This article presents the constraints and requirements of extruded networks, and discusses the problems and solutions of their implementation. A new solution is proposed. It is based on IPSec and Realm Specific IP protocol (RSIP), a protocol published as an RFC, mainly as an alternative to Network Address Translating (NAT). An extension is proposed to RSIP in order to improve the scalability of the solution. The use of IPSEC and the extended RSIP satisfies all the requirements for extruded subnets and enjoys excellent scalability. This extruded subnet implementation is now available as open source software.",

Two different DSLs are spectrally compatible if they can both use the same cable with low probability of significant degradation from crosstalk. Spectrum management is the process of ensuring spectral compatibility while optimizing the loop plant. Spectrum management requires knowledge of cable plant characteristics extending into higher frequency spectra (/spl sim/1 MHz), the different DSL types, and how to compute the impact of crosstalk. Also, definitions of the level of crosstalk from one DSL type that significantly degrades another DSL type is needed, which can only reach broad acceptance through industry-wide agreements. In the United States, DSL Access Standards Committee T1E1.4 has created a technical definition of spectral compatibility, the Spectrum Management Standard T1.417-2001. The details of DSL spectral compatibility and compliance with the standard are presented, as well as a history of the standard and some possibilities for the future.",

      "abstract": "Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. In a typical DDoS attack, a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim, or its Internet connection, or both. In the last two years, it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated, effective, and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods, and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms. The second is to discuss a longer-term solution, dubbed the Internet-firewall approach, that attempts to intercept attack packets in the Internet core, well before reaching the victim.",

      "abstract": "Integration of multiprotocol label switching functions and multiprotocol lambda switching functions can enhance the throughput of IP networks and remove bottlenecks that are derived from electrical packet processing. To enhance the packet forwarding capability, NTT proposed a photonic MPLS concept that includes MP/spl lambda/S, and demonstrated IP, MPLS, and photonic MPLS integrated router systems called the photonic MPLS router. This router system is now called the Hikari router. The word Hikari is Japanese meaning beam, light, lightwave, optical, photonic, and sunshine. The amount of IP data traffic has grown remarkably. Massive IP routers and flexible route control mechanisms are now required to cope with the increased amount of traffic. The Hikari router can offer two solutions utilizing photonic switching technologies, and photonic network operation and management technologies. The first solution is utilizing photonic switching technologies realized using optical-switch-based crossconnect systems. The other solution is realized using the MPLS and MP/spl lambda/S signaling protocol and photonic network protection functions. In this article we report on the implementation of the Hikari router systems, propose a newly developed disjoint path selection scheme for generalized MPLS networks with shared risk link group constraints, and demonstrate the signaling protocol and network protection functions. The demonstration system achieves a distributed optical path set-up/tear-down protocol with an extended constraint-based routing label distribution protocol. Fast self-healing through automatic protection switching and a new restoration scheme are also implemented. These functions are successfully implemented, and the performance is verified on a demonstration network. The protection switching scheme achieves protection in less than 20 ms, and the optical path restoration scheme achieves restoration in less than 500 ms.",

This article focuses on the design of a gateway station that acts as an interworking unit between the two segments of the systems. The guarantee of differentiated QoS for applications within the envisaged global IT system is achieved effectively by assuming that the IP IntServ model in the satellite access system is combined with a DiffServ fixed core network, in which the RSVP aggregation protocol is implemented. Thus, the design activity of the IWU mainly focuses on the following issues: seamless roaming between the two heterogeneous wireless and wired environments, efficient integration between the two IP service models (IntServ and DiffServ), and suitable mapping of terrestrial onto satellite bearer for traffic with different profiles and QoS requirements.",

      "abstract": "The next-generation wireless networks are evolving toward a versatile IP-based network that can provide various real-time multimedia services to mobile users. Two major challenges in establishing such a wireless mobile Internet are support of fast handoff and provision of quality of service (QoS) over IP-based wireless access networks. In this article, a DiffServ resource allocation architecture is proposed for the evolving wireless mobile Internet. The registration-domain-based scheme supports fast handoff by significantly reducing mobility management signaling. The registration domain is integrated with the DiffServ mechanism and provisions QoS guarantee for each service class by domain-based admission control. Furthermore, an adaptive assured service is presented for the stream class of traffic, where resource allocation is adjusted according to the network condition in order to minimize handoff call dropping and new call blocking probabilities.",

      "abstract": "Over the last few years an amazing amount of interest has emerged for applications of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in telecommunications. Silicon-based optical MEMS have proven to be the technology of choice for low-cost scalable photonic applications because they allow mass manufacturing of highly accurate miniaturized parts, and use materials with excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Applications include tunable lasers, optical switches, and tunable filters. The use of MEMS for optical switching has turned out to be most attractive since this application could revolutionize fiber optic telecommunications. We discuss the technology, performance, and reliability of 2D MEMS optical switches. We show that this technology meets the scalability, performance, and reliability requirements for important applications in fiber optic networks.",

Health care devices, such as heart rate monitors and dialysis machines, home and other security devices, and climate control devices, are a few of the device types that are increasingly becoming connectable to the Internet. When many such devices come together we say they form a ConnectedSpace. Many nonfunctional behavioral constraints, such as those related to safety, security, privacy, and fault tolerance, may be imposed on a ConnectedSpace. These constraints may be monitored and enforced by a centralized or distributed management algorithm. Various approaches may be used for enforcing the constraints.

      "abstract": "The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines. DSM-capable DSL thus enables the broadband age.",

      "abstract": "The wide deployment of wavelength-division multiplexing technology and new transmission techniques have resulted in significant increases in the transmission capacity in optical fibers, both in the number of wavelengths and the bandwidth of each wavelength channel. Meanwhile, the fast growth of the Internet demands more data switching capacity in the network in order to deliver high bandwidth to end users. Although the capacity of electronic routers has been increasing consistently in the past, optical switching appears to be a more cost-effective way to switch individual wavelengths. As the bit rate per wavelength channel continues to grow, optical subwavelength switching emerges as a new paradigm capable of dynamically delivering the vast bandwidth WDM offers. This article discusses one of such techniques, namely optical packet switching, and its performance perceived by end users in optical mesh networks. Specifically, our investigation reveals the benefit of using electrical ingress buffering and traffic aggregation to reduce packet-loss rate of optical packet-switched networks. Through simulation experiments, we present an evaluation of the network's TCP-level performance based on the proposed architecture.",

      "abstract": "Network resilience is becoming a key issue in the design of IP-based multimedia and multiservice networks. The current discussion about IP network resilience centers around MPLS-based recovery mechanisms. Any well designed recovery strategy has to take into account the different resilience requirements of the single traffic flows in order to avoid excessive usage of bandwidth for standby links. Faced with multiple recovery options, an ISP or NSP must decide which flows to protect to what extent against network failures. In this article an extension to existing quality of service (QoS) architectures is presented that integrates the signaling of resilience requirements with the traditional QoS signaling. We refer to this extended QoS model as resilience-differentiated QoS (RD-QoS). At the border of MPLS domains, the resilience requirements can then be directly mapped to the appropriate MPLS recovery options. A traffic engineering process for the provisioning of the resilience classes is introduced, and a case study demonstrates the significant network capacity savings achievable via this approach.",

      "abstract": "This article describes Ethernet passive optical networks, an emerging local subscriber access architecture that combines low-cost point-to-multipoint fiber infrastructure with Ethernet. EPONs are designed to carry Ethernet frames at standard Ethernet rates. An EPON uses a single trunk fiber that extends from a central office to a passive optical splitter, which then fans out to multiple optical drop fibers connected to subscriber nodes. Other than the end terminating equipment, no component in the network requires electrical power, hence the term passive. Local carriers have long been interested in passive optical networks for the benefits they offer: minimal fiber infrastructure and no powering requirement in the outside plant. With Ethernet now emerging as the protocol of choice for carrying IP traffic in metro and access networks, EPON has emerged as a potential optimized architecture for fiber to the building and fiber to the home.",

The IETF work defines requirements for layer 2 (the data link layer of the OSI model) to support optimized layer 3 (the network layer of the OSI model) handover and paging protocols. Layer 2 can send notification to layer 3 that a certain event has happened or is about to happen. The notification is sent using a trigger. We list the triggers needed by IP handover and paging protocols. We map the triggers to their corresponding events in CDMA2000.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses basic issues regarding the design and development of wireless access and wireless LAN systems that will operate in the 60 GHz band as part of the fourth-generation (4G) system. The 60 GHz band is of much interest since this is the band in which a massive amount of spectral space (5 GHz) has been allocated worldwide for dense wireless local communications. The article gives an overview of 60 GHz channel characteristics and puts them in their true perspective. In addition, we discuss how to achieve the exploitation of the abundant bandwidth resource for all kinds of short-range communications. The main tenor is that an overall system architecture should be worked out that provides industry with plenty of scope for product differentiation.

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (OFDM) is a recognized multicarrier solution to combat the effects of such multipath conditions. This article surveys frequency domain equalization (FDE) applied to single-carrier (SC) modulation solutions. SC radio modems with frequency domain equalization have similar performance, efficiency, and low signal processing complexity advantages as OFDM, and in addition are less sensitive than OFDM to RF impairments such as power amplifier nonlinearities. We discuss similarities and differences of SC and OFDM systems and coexistence possibilities, and present examples of SC-FDE performance capabilities.",

      "abstract": "A new extended signaling and traffic engineering method for the GMPLS-based photonic and electrical multilayer router (Hikari router) is proposed. The method allows dynamic optical network management and photonic signal recovery, such as regeneration, reshaping, etc., to be realized adaptively. Wavelength conversion is also adaptive, which reduces network cost. Multilayer traffic engineering, which yields the dynamic cooperation of IP and photonic layers, is described to provide IP services cost effectively. To realize multilayer traffic engineering, we propose the OSPF extension, which advertises both the number of total wavelengths and the number of unused wavelengths, and the RSVP-TE extension, which minimizes the number of wavelength conversions needed. In addition, this paper proposes a heuristics-based multilayer topology design scheme that uses IP traffic measurements in a generalized multi-protocol label switch (GMPLS). The proposed scheme yields the optical label switch path (OLSP) network topology, that is, OLSP placement, that minimizes network cost, in response to fluctuations in IP traffic demand. In other words, the OLSP network topology is dynamically reconfigured to match IP traffic demand. Networks are reconfigured by the proposed scheme so as to utilize network resources in the most cost effective manner.",

Mobile/wireless all-IP networks are expected to provide a substantially wider and enhanced range of services. However, an evolutionary rather than revolutionary approach to the deployment of a global all-IP wireless/mobile network is expected. To support global roaming, next-generation networks will require the integration and interoperation of mobility management processes under a worldwide wireless communications infrastructure. In this article global roaming is addressed as one of the main issues of next-generation mobile networks. Apart from the physical layer connectivity and radio spectrum allocation plans, mobility in a hierarchical structured scheme is discussed. An all-IP wireless/mobile network combined with inherited mobility schemes of each network layer and Mobile IP extensions is proposed. In this respect the mobility management mechanisms in WLAN, cellular, and satellite networks are analyzed, and an all-IP architecture is described and an enhanced roaming scenario presented.",

      "abstract": "We analyze IPv6 handover over wireless LAN. Mobile IPv6 is designed to manage mobile nodes' movements between wireless IPv6 networks. Nevertheless, the active communications of a mobile node are interrupted until the handover completes. Therefore, several extensions to Mobile IPv6 have been proposed to reduce the handover latency and the number of lost packets. We describe two of them, hierarchical Mobile IPv6, which manages local movements into a domain, and fast handover protocol, which allows the use of layer 2 triggers to anticipate the handover. We expose the specific handover algorithms proposed by all these methods. We also evaluate the handover latency over IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN. We compare the layer 2 and layer 3 handover latency in the Mobile IPv6 case in order to show the saving of time expected by using anticipation. We conclude by showing how to adapt the IEEE 802.11b control frames to set up such anticipation.",

A small number of research groups have overcome these difficulties and have made terabytes of captured network traffic available to the Internet community. We have discovered that even when initial hurdles to collecting traces have been overcome, there are potentially many methodological weaknesses that can severely limit the usefulness of the data collected. This article describes these weaknesses and suggests methodologies to avoid them. Five case studies from the work of the University of Waikato's WAND network research group are presented. These studies illustrate the need for care at all stages of the measurement process, analysis, and presenting the results.",

The quality of service, security, mobility, and high throughput are key components that drive the standards for broadband wireless multimedia communications presently being developed in Europe as well as in the United States and Japan for the 5 GHz band. These technologies are well suited to complement third-generation cellular networks. HiperLAN type 2 (HiperLAN2) is one of these systems, which is being specified by the ETSI project BRAN. The core parts of the specification were finalized at the end of 1999. Almost total harmonization has been achieved between the standardization bodies in Europe and Japan (ETSI and ARIB, respectively). HiperLAN2 will provide data rates up to 54 Mb/s, and is intended for local communications in indoor and outdoor environments. An overview of the HiperLAN2 standard is presented together with exemplary link and system performance results.",

      "abstract": "\"Home systems\" is a new consumer products industry. The market potential is very large, although the market has been evolving very tenuously. What is certain is that consumer demographics favor more conveniences for busy families and devices that assist those with physical limitations. Products based on home systems technology will serve both of these market segments. A variety of consortia and authorized standards bodies have been writing specifications for residential networks to provide a communications infrastructure for home systems and connections to external networks. This strategy of defining an infrastructure to support a nascent market is unusual. However, it offers the opportunity to specify a network without backward compatibility constraints, so often a requirement when upgrading and standardizing existing networks. This article addresses the fundamental question: has the home systems industry been successful in writing and adopting standards that promote industry growth? In part, the emergence of the home systems industry is a work in progress. Nevertheless, important standards and consortia programs have been developed since the mid-1980s. Some of the prominent achievements in home networks are reviewed. This article concludes that a clean slate offered by an undeveloped market is an advantage to standards writers. However, there needs to be a strong impetus to enter a potentially thriving market in order to motivate the standards writers to target and complete their work expeditiously. Otherwise, the writers will invest too much time perfecting their work, rather than making pragmatic compromises.",

Equipment vendors have begun to incorporate a variety of LAN and storage area network interfaces, notably Ethernet, Fibre Channel/FICON, and ESCON, on traditional metro and long-haul transport equipment. Embracing Ethernet and SAN technology enables the introduction of flexible high-capacity transport services optimized for data networking. Transport operators may thus offer both enterprise-centric connectivity services, such as transparent LAN connectivity and virtual LAN services, as well as traditional bandwidth services, such as private lines, while preserving the operations and management infrastructure of the existing public networks. We discuss the benefits of a hybrid Ethernet/TDM transport solution.",

On evaluating the heterogeneous access technologies, cellular layouts, and application characteristics of 4G environments, we realize a need to reduce both handoff latency and the frequency of mobility-related signaling. We first present IDMP's fast intradomain handoff mechanism that uses a duration-limited proactive packet multicasting solution. We quantify the expected buffering requirements of our proposed multicasting scheme for typical 4G network characteristics and compare it with alternative IP-based fast handoff solutions. We also present a paging scheme under IDMP that replicates the current cellular paging structure. Our paging mechanism supports generic paging strategies and can significantly reduce the mobility-related IP signaling load.",

      "abstract": "We investigate design issues for access networks based on passive optical network technology. A PON based on polling, with data encapsulated in Ethernet frames, possesses many desirable qualities, such as dynamic bandwidth distribution, use of a single downstream and a single upstream wavelength, ability to provision a fractional wavelength capacity to each user, and ease of adding a new user. To support dynamic bandwidth distribution, we propose an interleaved polling algorithm called IPACT. We also suggest a scheme for in-band signaling that allows using a single wavelength for both downstream data and control message transmission. To obtain realistic simulation results, we generated synthetic traffic that exhibits the properties of self-similarity and long-range dependence. We then analyzed the network performance under varying offered loads.",

The two major challenges for accurate location finding in indoor areas are the complexity of radio propagation and the ad hoc nature of the deployed infrastructure in these areas. Because of these difficulties a variety of signaling techniques, overall system architectures, and location finding algorithms are emerging for this application. This article provides a fundamental understanding of the issues related to indoor geolocation science that are needed for design and performance evaluation of emerging indoor geolocation systems.",

This article investigates to which extent switched connections and fast connection provisioning, typical for intelligent optical networks (IONs), can be used to provide resilience in an IP-over-optical multilayer network scenario. This solution, based on transport network flexibility, is compared with more traditional static multilayer resilience schemes in terms of cost (capacity) requirements and operational (dis)advantages.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes the interworking between performance enhancing proxies (PEPs) and IPsec in mobile networks. The low-throughput problem due to TCP/IP in a radio access network is illustrated. Performance comparison among different PEPs implemented in the RAN is carried out in order to optimize the spectrum efficiency. By using PEP, end-to-end security is compromised, and we propose a concept to circumvent this problem. Furthermore, we propose a way to utilize PEP for different network loads. We suggest a scheme that allows the coexistence of IPsec and PEP over mobile networks, through adding an intelligent module in the node where the PEP is implemented.",

It is a reservation-based architecture whose distinguishing characteristics are its relative simplicity, its amenability to hardware implementation, and the ability to support multicast natively. Another important feature is data transparency-the network infrastructure is independent of the format of the data being transmitted on individual wavelengths. We present the signaling protocol designed for this architecture, as well as an unified signaling message structure to be used in conjunction with the protocol. We also present the future directions of this research.",

      "abstract": "Power amplifier and transmitter linearization techniques are now a mature technology, with feedforward systems installed in many US base station sites for both TDMA and CDMA systems. Similarly, transmitter linearization techniques, such as Cartesian loop and predistortion, have been employed in mobile and portable equipment, and these have enabled a number of systems (e.g., iDEN in the United States and TETRA in Europe) to be realizable from a power consumption, cost, and size perspective. Such techniques are essential in the realization of an efficient and cost-effective software-defined radio system, whether deployed in a base station or a handset, and are thus a key enabling technology, without which SDR will not succeed. This article examines the current status of power amplifier and transmitter linearization technologies for mobile and base station equipment, and highlights some of the novel base station and network topologies now emerging based on these techniques. In many cases, these new topologies will revolutionize the way a cellular network is constructed and lead to very substantial cost reductions for a network operator.",

      "abstract": "Unbundling consists of the possibility for a new operator to have special access to an incumbent's network infrastructure in order to provide value-added services without the necessity to duplicate the infrastructure itself. Local loop unbundling has received the most attention in Europe and in Italy. Most Italian operators are interested mainly in physical access to copper loop, which gives the opportunity to offer broadband services pervasively by exploiting the capabilities of xDSL technology. Technical issues to be faced in offering these services are severe and include loop qualification, interference evaluation, and shortage of available loops. Nonetheless, the Italian case, where more than 20 incoming operators are planning to deploy services on unbundled local loops, demonstrates that this opportunity can be a major driver for the development of the broadband services market.",

      "abstract": "Continuous growth in demand for optical network capacity and the sudden maturation of WDM technologies have fueled the development of long-haul optical network systems that transport tens to hundreds of wavelengths per fiber, with each wavelength modulated at 10 Gb/s or more. Micro-electromechanical systems devices are recognized to be the enabling technologies to build the next-generation cost-effective and reliable high-capacity optical crossconnects. While the promises of automatically reconfigurable networks and bit-rate-independent photonic switching are bright, the endeavor to develop a high-port-count MEMS-based OXC involves overcoming challenges in MEMS design and fabrication, optical packaging, and mirror control. Due to the interdependence of many design parameters, manufacturing tolerances, and performance requirements, careful trade-offs must be made in MEMS device design as well as system design. We provide an overview of the market demand, various design trade-offs, and multidisciplinary system considerations for building reliable and manufacturable large MEMS-based OXCs.",

This article describes a heterogeneous network architecture including a common tool, a common platform, and a common access. In particular, software-defined radio technologies are used to develop a multiservice user terminal to access different wireless networks. The common platform for various wireless networks is based on a wireless-supporting IPv6 network. A basic access network, separated from other wireless access networks, is used as a means for wireless system discovery, signaling, and paging. A proof-of-concept experimental demonstration system is available.",

A taxonomy is also proposed for applications' characterization parameters, divided into five different types: service characteristics, traffic and communications parameters, service components, and operation environments. Because the multiservice traffic analysis of a mobile broadband system, with a given mixture of applications, requires the definition of their main operation environments, the respective deployment scenarios are defined. By incorporating these classifications and available forecast information, predictions of broadband application usage in deployment scenarios such as residential, business, and industrial markets are presented.",

      "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that using IP as the foundation for next-generation mobile networks makes strong economic and technical sense, since it takes advantage of the ubiquitous installed IP infrastructure, capitalizes on the IETF standardization process, and benefits from both existing and emerging IP-related technologies and services. The large-scale support of data services and their integration with legacy services are the common objectives of all wireless efforts termed third generation (3G) and beyond. In these all-IP wireless networks, IP can be deployed in two modes: the transport mode and the native mode. As we show in this article, this duality in the use of IP has a significant impact on network efficiency and performance. It is the extended native use of IP in the terrestrial segment of a wireless operator's domain that more readily allows for building a converged network with multiple access technologies. We then discuss the different levels of mobility in the all-IP network. In particular, our focus is on micromobility, and on the issue of seamless localized mobility within the converged network. After reviewing the mobility schemes that have emerged in previous years, we describe a hierarchical mobility management scheme based on multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). The scheme employs an enhanced type of MPLS routers, called label edge mobility agents, and is scalable, efficient, and flexible. It directly inherits the noted capabilities of MPLS in terms of support of QoS, traffic engineering, advanced IP services, and fast restoration. This scheme does not use nodes that are specific to any given wireless technology, and is well suited for gradual deployment.",

Internet traffic engineering is the process of allocating resources to meet the performance requirements of users and operators for their traffic. Current mechanisms for doing so, exemplified by TCP's congestion control or the variety of packet marking disciplines, concentrate on allocating resources on a per-packet basis or at data timescales. This article motivates the need for traffic engineering in the Internet at other timescales, namely control and management timescales, and presents three mechanisms for this. It also presents a scenario to show how these mechanisms increase the flexibility of operators' service offerings and potentially also ease problems of Internet management.",

      "abstract": "There has been an increasing demand for applications like multiplayer online gaming, where players residing in different parts of the world participate in the same gaming session through the Internet. Multicasting could prove to be an efficient way of providing necessary services for these applications. Furthermore, with the increasing popularity of handheld devices and mobile equipment, it is imperative to determine the best way to provide these services in a wireless environment. Due to very diverse requirements, it is necessary to investigate and discern the applicability of existing multicast protocols and qualify which is more suitable for which types of applications. This article provides a detailed description and comparison of IP-based wired and wireless multicast protocols. We hope that the discussion presented will be helpful to application developers in selecting an appropriate multicast protocol for their specific needs.",

We present and demonstrate the use of a general-purpose hierarchical multitier multiwindow statistical anomaly detection technology and system that operates automatically, adaptively, and proactively, and can be applied to various networking technologies, including both wired and wireless ad hoc networks. Our method uses statistical models and multivariate classifiers to detect anomalous network conditions. Some numerical results are also presented that demonstrate that our proposed methodology can reliably detect attacks with traffic anomaly intensity as low as 3-5 percent of the typical background traffic intensity, thus promising to generate an effective early warning.",

New ideas in capacity design and ring-to-mesh evolution are given, as well as a systematic comparison of the capacity requirements of several mesh-based schemes showing how they perform over a range of network graph connectivity. The work provides new options and insights to address the following questions. How does one evolve from an existing ring-based network to a future mesh network? If the facilities graph is very sparse, how can mesh efficiency be much better than rings? How do the options for mesh protection or restoration rank in capacity requirements? How much is efficiency increased if we enrich our network connectivity? We also outline p-cycles, showing this new concept can realize ring-like speed with meshlike efficiency. The scope is limited to conveying basic ideas with an understanding that they could be further adapted for use in IP or DWDM layers with GMPLS-type protocols or a centralized control plane.",

Carriers have developed extensive expertise in operating, managing, and developing business models for these systems. Manufacturers' technical expertise in such systems has increased to a deep understanding of what transport over fiber is about. In short, SONET/SDH can be called a mature transport technology. Out of this mature expertise, new techniques for bettering transport over fiber services have appeared. These techniques are likely to considerably reshape the next generation of SONET/SDH systems in many aspects: new transport techniques, new transport services, new management systems and business models. We describe several new transport techniques, and discuss their impact on the creation of new transport services for next-generation SONET/SDH systems.",

      "abstract": "For every packet an IP router receives, it makes a routing decision based on the packet's destination address. The router's forwarding rate is usually limited by the rate at which it can make these decisions. We describe a new method for implementing route lookups in hardware. Our method can be implemented in the forwarding engine of a network processor or router using a small on-chip SRAM and an off-chip DRAM, and it achieves a rate of one lookup per DRAM random access time. We present our method and discuss an implementation that uses a DRAM with 64 ns random access time to give over 15 million lookups per second. Our tests show that the method performs well for realistic routing tables while using only modest amounts of memory.",

      "abstract": "In telecommunication networks, as in many other areas of science and engineering, the proliferation of computers as research tools has resulted in the adoption of computer simulation as the most commonly used paradigm of scientific investigations. This, together with a plethora of existing simulation languages and packages, has created a popular opinion that simulation is mainly an exercise in computer programming. In new computing environments, programming can be minimized, or even fully replaced, by the manipulation of icons (representing prebuilt programming objects containing basic functional blocks of simulated systems) on a computer monitor. One can say that we have witnessed another success of modern science and technology: the emergence of wonderful and powerful tools for exploring and predicting the behavior of such complex stochastic dynamic systems as telecommunication networks. But this enthusiasm is not shared by all researchers in this area. An opinion is spreading that one cannot rely on the majority of the published results on performance evaluation studies of telecommunication networks based on stochastic simulation, since they lack credibility. Indeed, the spread of this phenomenon is so wide that one can speak about a deep crisis of credibility. In this article this claim is supported by the results of a survey of over 2200 publications on telecommunication networks in proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM and such journals as IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, and Performance Evaluation Journal. The discussion focuses on two important necessary conditions of a credible simulation study: use of appropriate pseudo-random generators of independent uniformly distributed numbers, and appropriate analysis of simulation output data. Having considered their perils and pitfalls, we formulate guidelines that, if observed, could help to ensure a basic level of credibility of simulation studies of telecommunication networks.",

      "abstract": "Cellular telephony networks depend on an extensive wired network to provide access to the radio link. The wired network, called a radio access network, provides such functions as power control and, in CDMA networks, combination of soft handoff legs (also known as macrodiversity resolution) that require coordination between multiple radio base stations and multiple mobile terminals. Existing RAN architectures for cellular systems are based on a centralized radio network controller connected by point-to-point links with the radio base transceiver stations. The existing architecture is subject to a single point of failure if the RNC fails, and is difficult to expand because adding an RNC is expensive. Also, although a network operator may have multiple radio link protocols available, most RAN architectures treat each protocol separately and require a separate RAN control protocol for each. We describe a new architecture, the OpenRAN architecture, based on a distributed processing model with a routed IP network as the underlying transport fabric. OpenRAN was developed by the Mobile Wireless Internet Forum IP in the RAN working group. The OpenRAN architecture applies principles to the radio access network that have been successful in reducing cost and increasing reliability in data communications networks. The result is an architecture that can serve as the basis for an integrated next-generation cellular radio access network.",

      "abstract": "The research on optical packet switching (OPS) has witnessed considerable progress in the 1990s. We examine the future potential of OPS in the core network by discussing this switching approach and the current status of a number of its enabling technologies. Many of these technologies are still in the stage of research and experimentation. We see that optical packet switching may be deployed in the long-term future subject to satisfaction of three main conditions/developments. First, additional technological developments have to take place to overcome remaining implementation challenges while making OPS cost-effective to deploy. Second, a rational migration scenario of the network toward gradual deployment of packet-based optical switching approaches should exist. Finally, carriers have to become more interested in packet-based optical switching solutions.",

      "abstract": "This article outlines an approach for multicast congestion control based on an economic model that has been successfully applied to unicast congestion control. In this model, congestion signals are interpreted as prices and congestion-controlled sessions as utility maximizing agents. A naive extension of the unicast model fails to achieve a reasonable balance between providing the incentives necessary to promote the use of multicast and ensuring that multicast sessions do not interact too aggressively with unicast sessions. We extend the model by introducing a rational definition of multicast utility. The revised model provides a basis for multicast congestion control protocols that provide incentives to use multicast but are necessarily unfair to unicast traffic. We show, however, that the degree of unfairness can be controlled by appropriately setting a design parameter with a limiting case of strict fairness.",

We have implemented all of these techniques on the ns-2 simulation platform using generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) control signaling. These techniques can handle practical situations such as simultaneous multiple fiber failures, which are difficult to design for and recover from by nonrestoration techniques. We then present performance measurement results for the three restoration techniques by applying them to a typical nationwide mesh network running IP over WDM. We investigate interesting trade-offs in the performance of the restoration techniques on restoration success rate, average restoration time, availability, and blocking probability.",

A number of possible network architectures as well as protocols are reviewed. The article also proposes and analyses a WDM slotted-ring network architecture with nodes that use one fixed transmitter and fixed receivers. Used as a metropolitan access network, it is shown through simulation how a simple slotted MAC protocol can be implemented in this network to achieve efficient bandwidth utilization. Throughput, delay and packet dropping probability results are presented under Poisson and self-similar traffic.",

      "abstract": "The Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) will play a very important role in the telecommunication market of the near future. Due to the wide range of services and the increased transmission capacity, UMTS will become one of the most important access network types. The proposed topology of the UMTS terrestrial access network is tree-like, but the high amount of carried traffic requires a more reliable network structure. We introduce two types of heuristic algorithms to solve this problem, and we plan network topologies having a low magnitude of traffic loss in case of failures. One of our algorithms solves the problem by modifying the tree-topology, while others expand the network by inserting additional links. We show how to find a good compromise between topology refinement and network expansion in the case of realistic network scenarios, and we confirm our results by detailed tests.",

      "abstract": "The availability of small, inexpensive low-power GPS receivers and techniques for finding relative coordinates based on signal strengths, and the need for the design of power-efficient and scalable networks provided justification for applying position-based routing methods in ad hoc networks. A number of such algorithms were developed previously. This tutorial will concentrate on schemes that are loop-free, localized, and follow a single-path strategy, which are desirable characteristics for scalable routing protocols. Routing protocols have two modes: greedy mode (when the forwarding node is able to advance the message toward the destination) and recovery mode (applied until return to greedy mode is possible). We discuss them separately. Methods also differ in metrics used (hop count, power, cost, congestion, etc.), and in past traffic memorization at nodes (memoryless or memorizing past traffic). Salient properties to be emphasized in this review are guaranteed delivery, scalability, and robustness.",

He has chosen to restrict himself to the decade timescale since predicting beyond that time frame is likely to be writing science fiction. This article addresses two major themes. The first explores at the 10,000-foot level the major technology changes one expects to bear fruit over the next decade; the second explores the implications of these changes on our society. Since the time the talk on which this article is based was given, the world has changed. The need for security and robustness of our electronic infrastructure has dramatically increased, and our understanding of how to do this unfortunately has not kept up with the need. In many countries, there is an increasing strain between the privacy desires of citizens and the desire for safety. In many industries, such as music and motion pictures, the rapid expansion of digital content and the ease of distribution of that content has created demands for increased protection, much of which must be implemented in computer hardware and networking protocols. How this will impact the perceived right of the public to fair use of that material is a battle being fought in the legislature and the courts. First he explores the technological directions of the next decade.",

      "abstract": "Research and development on network survivability has largely focused on public switched telecommunications networks and high-speed data networks with little attention on the survivability of wireless access networks supporting cellular and PCS communications. This article discusses the effects of failures and survivability issues in PCS networks with emphasis on the unique difficulties presented by user mobility and the wireless channel environment. A simulation model to study a variety of failure scenarios on a PCS network is described, and the results show that user mobility significantly worsens network performance after failures, as disconnected users move among adjacent cells and attempt to reconnect to the network. Thus, survivability strategies must be designed to contend with spatial as well as temporal network behavior. A multilayer framework for the study of PCS network survivability is presented. Metrics for quantifying network survivability are identified at each layer. Possible survivability strategies and restoration techniques for each layer in the framework are also discussed.",

Furthermore, we describe how best-effort networks lead to a pricing mechanism that charges users in accordance to the stress they place on the network.",

This article copes with the interoperability between 3G wireless networks and wired next-generation IP networks, for the provision of services with an a priori known quality level over both environments. More specifically, the UMTS architecture as well as a prototypical implementation of the next-generation Internet based on DiffServ are considered. The article focuses on the mapping among the traffic classes of the two networks at the point where the networks converge, and discusses the requirements and possible solutions for their proper interworking at the signaling and user levels. Simulations prove that proper mapping among the traffic classes of each world is necessary in order to achieve the desired end-to-end traffic characteristics.",

A multihop switched Ethernet data transport can be used over this access network. Wang (see Internet QoS: Architectures and Mechanisms for Quality of Service, Morgan Kaufmann, 2001) discussed the benefits of upgrading the hybrid fiber coax plant into a distributed switched Ethernet trunk-and-branch network capable of fiber-like transmission speeds. This article focuses on QoS management in the proposed next-generation broadband access network (NGBAN) based on a multihop switched Ethernet network architecture. This network architecture and QoS management framework are more generally applicable, and we anticipate they will form the basis for the \"last mile\" independent of the physical medium.",

      "abstract": "We present a framework for QoS routing computation with path caching. The framework has three phases to allow different levels of information to be processed at different timescales to effectively meet QoS requirement of a newly arrived flow. Path caching is introduced in the first phase to allow selection and filtering in subsequent phases. We describe several routing schemes that can fit into this framework. Through simulation results, we show where and how the benefit of path caching can be exploited depending on the number of paths cached, and when to invoke other controls. Our results show that QoS routing by itself cannot improve the network and/or service performance unless controls such as trunk reservation and source-based admission control are also activated. The invocation of these functions can also allow maximum benefit from the path caching framework.",

      "abstract": "Much research in QoS routing has focused on the unicast communication paradigm. However, another communication paradigm - anycasting - has grown in importance. In the anycast paradigm, one endpoint is specified and the other is selected from a set of \"equivalent\" endpoints. An anycast service in a QoS-based network requires selection of both an endpoint and a path that satisfies a QoS constraint. This article provides background material on anycasting in both best-effort networks and QoS-based networks. We then focus on the differentiated services QoS model, and present the design of a QoS-based anycasting architecture consistent with that model. Via simulations, we explore the design options implied by the architecture, including signaling protocols, server selection/sorting algorithms, and resource reservation granularity. We conclude by highlighting open problems in the emerging area of QoS-based anycasting.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates how constraint-based routing decision granularity significantly affects the scalability and blocking performance of QoS routing in an MPLS network. Coarse granularity, such as per-destination, has lower storage and computational overheads but is only suitable for best effort traffic. On the other hand, fine granularity, such as per-flow, provides lower blocking probability for bandwidth requests, but requires a huge number of states and high computational cost. To achieve cost-effective scalability, this study proposes using hybrid granularity schemes. The overflowed cache of the per-pair/flow scheme adds a per-pair cache and a per-flow cache as the routing cache, and performs well in blocking probability. The per-pair/class scheme groups the flows into several paths using routing marks, thus allowing packets to be label-forwarded with a bounded cache.",

The proposed MAC protocol exploits both time-division and code-division statistical multiplexing. The FPLS scheduler uses the information of traffic rate distribution and quality of service requirements to assign priorities to the users and determines an efficient combination of the packets for transmission in the time slots of each frame, so the number of the served users is maximized under the QoS constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FPLS scheduler, in comparison with other previously proposed scheduling algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Classical approaches to QoS provisioning in IP networks are difficult to apply in all-optical networks. This is mainly because there is no optical counterpart to the store-and-forward model that mandates the use of buffers for queuing packets during contention for bandwidth in electronic packet switches. Since plain IP assumes a best effort service model, there is a need to devise mechanisms for QoS provisioning in IP over wavelength-division multiplexing networks. Such mechanisms must consider the physical characteristics and limitations of the optical domain. This article presents a classification and survey of proposals for QoS provisioning and enforcement in IP-over-WDM networks. The different QoS proposals surveyed cover three major optical switching methods: wavelength routing, optical packet switching, and optical burst switching.",

      "abstract": "While the details of the next-generation IPv6 protocol are now reaching maturity, the next hurdle in realizing the promises of IPv6 is the need for deployment on a wider scale. Previously, the migration from IPv4 to IPv6 has been considered nontrivial, a factor generally attributed to thwarting its success. However, with the advent of a number of new transitioning techniques the evolution to IPv6 is now becoming increasingly feasible. These transitioning techniques offer tunneling and translation solutions that enable the gradual introduction of IPv6 support into an existing IPv4 infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear what form this evolution is likely to take, which phases are likely to exist, and how the transition process will proceed. This article examines existing IETF IPv6 transitioning mechanisms and discusses the key issues involved in IPv6 deployment. We examine those aspects that potentially affect the choice of transition mechanisms and look at what factors are likely to mould the evolutionary path.",

We have changed this protocol from an event-driven protocol to a timed protocol in order to also guarantee that all of the receivers have a source message by a deadline. Certain of the control messages that are transmitted by the receivers in this protocol are scheduled to occur at specified times, rather than responding to other messages. This results in short sequences of protocol states that are independent of one another, rather than a protocol machine that is recursive and runs indefinitely. It is easier to prove the properties of these short sequences of events than to prove those of many protocols that have indefinitely long sequences.",

      "abstract": "The focus of quality-of-service routing has been on the routing of a single path satisfying specified QoS constraints. Upon failure of a node or link on the path, a new path satisfying the constraints has to be established. However, resources needed to satisfy the QoS requirements are not guaranteed to be available at the rerouting instant, so QoS is not guaranteed upon failure. Restorable QoS routing, where active and backup paths must be simultaneously set up, has been previously studied. This is mostly motivated by the incorporation of mechanisms to establish QoS guaranteed paths with failure protection in multiprotocol label switching networks. This article describes some previously developed algorithms for dynamic routing of restorable QoS guaranteed paths.",

      "abstract": "A mobile ad hoc network consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration. MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the \"black hole\" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs. We also propose a solution for the black hole problem for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol.",

Static elements, including firewalls and network address translation devices, are not capable of allowing dynamic applications to operate properly. The Secure Telephony Enabled Middlebox (STEM) architecture is an enhancement of the existing network design to remove the issues surrounding static devices. The architecture incorporates an improved firewall that can interpret and utilize information in the application layer of packets to ensure proper functionality. In addition to allowing dynamic applications to function normally, the STEM architecture also incorporates several detection and response mechanisms for well-known network-based vulnerabilities.

The focus is on the analysis of the scalability implications of these virtual private network mechanisms on existing service provider backbone networks. Very often, when deploying VPN services, service providers will be confronted with a trade-off between scalability and security. VPNs that require site-to-site interconnectivity without strong (cryptographic) security can be deployed in a scalable way based on the network-based VPN model, as long as the interaction between the customer and provider routing dynamics are controlled. VPNs that require strong (end-to-end) cryptographic security should be deployed according to the CPE-based VPN model, using the available IPsec protocol suite.",

In these switches, the port that sources a multicast session might easily get congested as it becomes more popular. We propose that destination ports should forward copies of multicast packets to other destination ports in a specified order. In this way, the multicast traffic load is evenly distributed over the switch ports. Packets are scheduled according to the weighted sequential greedy algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure. In this article, we survey the up-to-date secure routing schemes. that appeared over the last few years. Our critical point of view and thorough review of the literature are an attempt to identify directions for future research on an indeed difficult and still largely open problem.",

He draws some parallels between spammers trying to trick victims to opt out of their e-mail list in order to obtain information on valid e-mail addresses with so-called social engineering techniques used by security perpetrators. The term social engineering is typically used to describe a human-interactive (the emphasis is on the word human as opposed to computer-based) process that tricks people into violating security policies and procedures to get unauthorized access to protected information exposing security vulnerabilities. The best way to deal with social engineering threats is through creating and enforcing strict security procedures through education and training.",

This article discusses the potential benefits of this structure and addresses several relevant issues necessary to support such a network. More specifically, it focuses on connection establishment and self-organization, investigates the formulation of an optimum transmission strategy, and examines some of the techniques by which we can augment the capacity or enhance the system performance in this multihop network. We also present capacity bounds that illustrate how these techniques help in trading off conserved power for a multifold capacity advantage.",

However, fairness among flows sharing the same service, may, not be provided. Our goal is to study fairness between scalable multimedia sessions for assured DS services in a multicast network environment. To achieve this goal, we present a fairness mechanism called session-aware popularity-based resource allocation (SAPRA), which allocates resources to scalable. sessions based on their number of receivers. Simulation results in a scalable and multireceiver scenario show that SAPRA maximizes the utilization, of bandwidth and the number of receivers with high-quality reception.",

      "abstract": "Governments may facilitate the introduction of new types of wireless communication services through use of a self-regulated spectrum management system known as spectrum licensing. Spectrum licensing is able to break the nexus between the equipment standardization process and obtaining regulatory approval to access spectrum, avoiding delays and effectively harmonizing spectrum use. There are similar trends at play in several countries, and spectrum licensing can have different levels of implementation of the technical framework, even within a single country, depending on the objectives sought and the manner in which those objectives are designed to be achieved within a particular frequency band. Just as the circumstances that seem to block us in our everyday life depend on our framework of assumptions, the possibilities of spectrum licensing also depend on the chosen technical framework. When a framework is fully implemented, the important underlying objectives are to maximize flexibility and certainty for the operation of equipment while minimizing negotiation for the management of interference. Flexibility facilitates the management of change, and certainty creates a stable basis for that change. And, with minimal negotiation, change is faster and cheaper. The Australian case is taken as an example. The 3.4 GHz band has just been auctioned with license conditions that, for the first time, have been designed to allow equitable spectrum access for both point-to-point and mobile-like services.",

      "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the explosive expansion of the Internet and the continued dramatic increase in demand for high-speed multimedia wireless services, there is an urgent demand for flexible, bandwidth-efficient transceivers. Multistandard operation is also an important requirement for the future generations of wireless systems. This article presents a versatile broadband multiple access scheme, combining frequency hopping with multicarrier DS-CDMA (FH/MC DS-CDMA). In the short term, the proposed FH/MC DS-CDMA scheme could be employed in the existing second- and third-generation CDMA system bands. Hence, it has the potential of supporting compatibility with these existing systems. This article also shows that FH/MC DS-CDMA exhibits a high grade of flexibility in the context of system design and parameter reconfiguration. Therefore, in the long term, the proposed FH/MC DS-CDMA scheme is capable of meeting the requirements of future broadband mobile wireless systems, with the aid of introducing more advanced techniques facilitated by the employment of software-defined radios (SDR) and with the advent of efficient adaptive baseband algorithms.",

The emphasis is on physical layer modem algorithms such as channel estimation, equalization, and interference cancellation. However, we also discuss the impact of space-time coding gains at the physical layer on throughput at or above the networking layer. Furthermore, we describe a flexible graphical user interface attached to our physical layer simulation engine in order to explore the performance of space-time codes under a variety of practical transmission scenarios. Simulation results for the EDGE cellular system and the 802.11 wireless LAN environment are presented.",

Many valuable location-based services can be enabled by this new feature. Telecommunication managers and engineers are often puzzled by location terminologies and techniques as well as how to implement them, since location systems are not natural evolution from past generations of telecommunication systems. In this paper, we discuss briefly why locating mobile phone becomes a hot topic and what technologies are being studied. We then describe and clarify the latest standards issues surrounding the positioning methods specified for 3G systems. These include cell-ID-based, assisted GPS, and TDOA-based methods, such as OTDOA, E-OTD, and A-FLT.",

      "abstract": "The next-generation optical communications network, not surprisingly at all, will be as optical as it can be. Only optical dense wavelength-division multiplexing can provide the bandwidth elasticity that new emerging communications services demand. This is well understood, and despite an apparent slowdown in the world economy, multibillion-dollar commitments have been made to upgrade existing networks to next-generation DWDM. The next optical network is expected to be massive, yet flexible and ubiquitous. Current DWDM technology supports 160 wavelengths (in the C+L bands) per fiber; at 10 Gb/s this amounts to an astonishing 1.6 Tb/s aggregate bandwidth per fiber. Research has also demonstrated that ultra dense WDM (UDWDM) is possible, and it is a matter of time until 320 wavelengths (and a little later 640) will be multiplexed in a single fiber. As a consequence, we examine what the next optical network should be like, and proactively identify some areas that require special attention. One of the critical areas is service and network survivability not only when a node and/or link fails, but also when a cluster of nodes and/or links fail; that is, avoiding a disaster. Disaster avoidance has also become more important for both natural disasters and geo-political unrest.",

      "abstract": "One of the biggest barriers to the development of public IP telephony services has been the lack of a universal addressing system. While IP-enabled devices have long been capable of originating phone and fax calls, it is difficult to \"call\" an IP device because they are hard to find. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 2916, \"E.164 Number and DNS,\" seeks to solve this problem in a simple and perhaps unlikely way. Simple, in that the ENUM protocol converts existing telephone numbers into domain names.The designers of ENUM hope to foster a global megadirectory of communications users who can be reached in any number of ways by means of only one number. While theoretically any character space could be standardized in an attempt to create a universal addressing scheme, ENUM explicitly adopts telephone numbers, presumably to take advantage of their global user acceptance and mature infrastructure. This choice adds a significant public policy dimension to the story. Far from being benign and boring, telephone numbers can present significant communications policy issues, and are regulated both domestically and internationally. The top level of this hierarchy is defined by International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation E.164.",

The main objective of METRA was the performance evaluation of multi-antenna terminals in combination with adaptive antennas at the base station in UMTS communication systems. A MIMO channel sounder was developed that provided realistic multi-antenna channel measurements. Using these measured data, stochastic channel models were developed and properly validated. These models were also evaluated in order to estimate their corresponding channel capacity. Different MIMO configurations and processing schemes were developed for both the FDD and TDD modes of UTRA, and their link performance was assessed. Performance evaluation was completed by system simulations that illustrated the benefits of MIMO configurations to the network operator. Implementation cost vs. performance improvement was also covered by the project, including the base station and terminal manufacturer and network operator viewpoints. Finally, significant standards contributions were generated by the project and presented to the pertinent 3GPP working groups.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the prototype developed to prove the Zipper concept and contribute to VDSL standardization. This solution includes the hardware and software needed to demonstrate that the VDSL multicarrier is a feasible, flexible, high-performance, competitive solution. The prototype provides the network management and telemetry software needed to simplify system setup and performance evaluation, respectively. It includes two interfaces: one to plug a twisted pair cable or a cable simulator, and the other to connect the ATM transport protocol. A 155 Mb/s (OC-3 rate) ATM-SDH/SONET interface is provided too. The first measurements performed between two VDSL modems, with injected noise of 20 VDSL equivalent lines, show that it is possible to transmit (in downstream and upstream directions) payload bit rates up to 48 Mb/s at 300 m and up to 25 Mb/s at 1500 m using 0.5 mm copper cables. The prototype has been designed using a modular and flexible architecture able to allow future VDSL modem extensions. The reuse of this prototype is expected for other applications where OFDM technology applies.",

The article considers the development of each of a series of about 20 essential concepts. For example, it examines such subjects as the degree of redundancy to achieve any desired level of survivability; the necessity to chop data streams into small blocks; what information had to be appended to these blocks to allow the each block to find its own way through the network; why it was necessary for each network element to operate at an independent data rate; why all signals had to be converted to digital, and so on. It describes the \"why\" as well as the \"how\" of packet switching works.",

      "abstract": "The game to play in wireless communications, when it comes to increasing spectrum efficiency, is eliminating interference. Currently, all cellular systems use frequency-division duplexing in an attempt to eliminate interference from adjacent cells. The use of many technologies has limited the effects of interference, but two types of interference remain. These are adjacent base-to-home mobile interference and adjacent mobile-to-home base interference, Time-division duplexing has not been used for mobile cellular systems because it is even more susceptible to different forms of interference. Not only is TDD subject to adjacent base-to-home mobile interference and adjacent mobile-to-home base interference; it also has to battle additional adjacent base-to-home base interference, and adjacent mobile-to-home mobile interference. Therefore, TDD can only be used for small confined area systems. Code-division duplexing (CDD) is an innovative solution that can eliminate all four kinds of interference: adjacent base-to-home mobile, adjacent mobile-to-home base, adjacent base-to-home base, and adjacent mobile-to-home mobile in cellular systems. Eliminating each of these types of interference makes CDD the most spectrum-efficient duplexing system. This article elaborates on a set of smart codes that will make an efficient CDD system a reality.",

Next, we investigate in detail those characteristics of O-CDMA that make it an attractive technology for application in metro access networks: fairness, flexibility, simplified network control and management, service differentiation, and increased security. Although O-CDMA has many favorable attributes, it also has several actual or perceived drawbacks. We discuss the technical, economic, and perception barriers that may have limited the widescale deployment of O-CDMA access networks. We try to determine which of these drawbacks may be surmountable in the near future and which may be true \"showstoppers\".",

      "abstract": "In 1960 the transmission technology of the public switched telephone network was ordinary cable pairs, carrier systems on both paired and coaxial cable, and point-to-point microwave radio systems. Voice signals were frequency multiplexed for efficient transmission, but remained in analog form from end to end of a connection. Electromechanical switching systems provided circuit-switched connections, and about half of the customers could directly dial long distance calls. The following decade saw the beginnings of electronic switching and direct distance dialing on a global basis. Meanwhile, applying digital technology to achieve lower costs and better quality for voice transport began in earnest, and the interconnection of data terminals and computer centers became an increasingly important communications need. The initial data communications approach, still used with ever increasing sophistication and speed, was to convert data to speech-like form with data modems. Later, the direct connection of digital data to digital network facilities became the method of choice for building computer communications networks and the backbone of the Internet. It now appears likely that one day all signals, including voice, will be transported by unified high-speed digital networks with a common set of protocols.",

      "abstract": "Traffic engineering involves adapting the routing of traffic to network conditions, with the joint goals of good user performance and efficient use of network resources. We describe an approach to intradomain traffic engineering that works within the existing deployed base of interior gateway protocols, such as Open Shortest Path First and Intermediate System-Intermediate System. We explain how to adapt the configuration of link weights, based on a networkwide view of the traffic and topology within a domain. In addition, we summarize the results of several studies of techniques for optimizing OSPF/IS-IS weights to the prevailing traffic. The article argues that traditional shortest path routing protocols are surprisingly effective for engineering the flow of traffic in large IP networks.",

      "abstract": "The limited size and structure of the Internet address space of IPv4 has caused difficulties in coping with the explosive increase in the number of Internet users. IPv6 is a feasible solution for the problems identified with IPv4. Efficient interworking between IPv4 and IPv6 is very important, because IPv4 networks and services will exist for quite a long time. The transition period will be lengthy, and network/terminal equipment supporting both IP versions will be needed during the transition period. Thus, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues need special care and attention. The three main transition methods are dual IPv4/IPv6 stacks in network elements/terminals, tunneling, and translators in the network. Three transition phases from IPv4 to IPv6 can be identified. These phases are described. Different transition scenarios from the 2G/3G mobile network point of view are also analyzed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn, and some recommendations on the use of transition methods are given.",

      "abstract": "Transmit diversity (TD) is one of the key contributing technologies to defining the ITU endorsed 3G systems W-CDMA and cdma2000. Spatial diversity is introduced into the signal by transmitting through multiple antennas. The antennas are spaced far enough apart that the signals emanating from them can be assumed to undergo independent fading. In addition to diversity gain, antenna gain can also be incorporated through channel state feedback. This leads to the categorization of TD methods into open loop and closed loop methods. Several methods of transmit diversity in the forward link have been either under consideration or adopted for the various 3G standards. This article describes the concept of transmit diversity and explains the features of selected TD techniques.",

In response to the changes, telecommunications equipment manufacturers and service providers are competing fiercely to bring an optimum solution to customers. The evolution of GSM to GPRS and to UMTS is a cellular wireless industry endeavour to meet this demand. This evolution will see the core wireless network infrastructure change from circuit-switched to packet-switched where voice and data are transported using IP as the common protocol. However, this poses a number of challenges, one of which is how to run the key mobile application part signaling protocols over IP. MAP defines the application protocols between switches and databases (e.g., MSC, VLR, SGSN, HLR) for supporting mobility management, security management, radio resource management, and mobile equipment management. UMTS supports both circuit-switched and packet-switched services.",

      "abstract": "The current Internet architecture appears to not be particularly suited to addressing the emerging needs of new classes of users who wish to gain access to multimedia services made available by ISPs, regardless of their location, while in motion and with a guaranteed level of quality. One of the main objectives of so-called next-generation systems is to overcome the limitations of today's available Internet by adopting an approach based on the integration of different mobile and fixed networks. The SUITED project moves in this direction since it aims at contributing to the design and deployment of the global mobile broadband system (GMBS), a unique satellite/terrestrial infrastructure ensuring nomadic users access to Internet services with a negotiated QoS. A description of the main features of the GMBS architecture, characterized by the integration of a multisegment access network with a federated ISP network is given in this article. The GMBS multimode terminal is schematically described, and an overview of the so-called QoS-aware mobility management scheme, devised for such a heterogeneous scenario, is provided.",

      "abstract": "We present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through Internet links. We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional \"flat rate user bandwidth consumption\" approaches to provisioning and engineering.",

      "abstract": "The operation of TCP in wireless mobile environments is discussed. After presenting previous efforts to ameliorate TCP performance in the considered environments, we propose a new mechanism for tackling the transmission slowdown problems caused by handovers. Our proposal is based on stochastic datagram relocation. Traffic destined to the mobile terminal is tunneled to and cached into adjacent cells according to the output of a path prediction algorithm. To reduce the associated overhead, only percentages of inbound traffic are copied to the cell's neighborhood on the basis of estimated probabilities. The time scheduling for datagram relocation is also taken into account. Simulations of the proposed architecture show substantial performance improvements for TCP traffic.",

This article analyzes how those trends can be combined. It compares the advantages of VoMPLS with VoATM, VoIP, and VoFR, from the viewpoints of bandwidth utilization, implementation issues, and the region of the network (access/backbone) in which implementation takes place. VoMPLSoPPP is more efficient than VoMPLSoATM or VoMPLSoEthernet. In the network backbone VoMPLSoPPP is most efficient. VoAAAL2oATM has intermediate efficiency, and VoIP is highly inefficient. In the access network use of header compression improves the efficiency of VoIP but does not bring it to the level of VoAAL2oATM, which is approximately as efficient as VoMPLSoEthernet. VoMPLSoPPP remains most efficient.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a review of integrated laser and semiconductor optical amplifier components that have been configured to provide a variety of all-optical functions such as wavelength conversion, routing, signal regeneration, and add-drop multiplexing. The components have been devised so that they can be reliably and simply used within a multiwavelength network. The article introduces the components by outlining the current leading techniques for wavelength conversion using SOAs, namely by way of cross-gain modulation, cross-phase modulation, and four-wave mixing. The integrated SOA distributed feedback laser is then shown to provide excellent regeneration properties, not only overcoming fiber dispersion limitations but also polarization mode dispersion. Finally, the devices are shown to make possible a regenerative wavelength switching node where routing is achieved using a tunable laser to provide regenerative wavelength conversion followed by an arrayed waveguide router. This switch shows promise for use in future photonic packet switching architectures.",

Even though it was designed primarily for private applications, WiFi is also being deployed in public places to create so-called hotspots, where WiFi-capable users can obtain broadband Internet access. This new domain of application could be the major future market opportunity for WiFi, but in order to take advantage of it, several key challenges, both technical and business-related, must be overcome. We outline these challenges and discuss approaches to solutions.",

Enabling wireless Internet access is one of the upcoming challenges for mobile radio network operators. The General Packet Radio Service is the packet-switched extension of GSM and was developed to facilitate access to IP-based services better than existing circuit-switched services provided by GSM. We illustrate how a visited mobile subscriber on a GPRS/UMTS network can access his/her home network via the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN).

      "abstract": "Provision of telecommunication services by means of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) is becoming a relevant topic of interest for the research activities on future-generation systems. Mobility on demand, large coverage, and payload reconfigurability are only some examples of the expected benefits for personal communication systems based on the use of such platforms. The research regarding the use of HAPs for communications has so far neglected that they are also a privileged infrastructure for the provision of navigation and positioning services. They can act as augmentation infrastructures for global navigation satellite systems such as GPS and the future Galileo, easily performing direction of arrival estimation thanks to their high position, collecting and broadcasting position information. Despite these interesting services, the real added value is in the fact that their payload can easily integrate both communication and navigation services, with mutual benefits for both systems. The scope of this article is to discuss the feasibility of integrating HAPs with communication networks (e.g., UMTS) and navigation systems, providing an overview of different system aspects (payload, user segment).",
