In this article, we present the performance analysis of an end-to-end mobile tele-echography using an ultra-light robot (OTELO), over the third-generation (3G) mobile communications network. The experimental setup of the OTELO system over a 3G connectivity link used to measure the system performance is described. The performance of the relevant medical data and the relevant quality of service (QoS) issues defined in terms of the average throughput, delta-time packet delay, and jitter delay are investigated. The real-time 3G performance results show the successful operation of this bandwidth demanding robotic m-health system.",

Furthermore, they can offer a diversity of services, whereby an optimal tradeoff can be made for end users in comfort, cost, security, and mobility. We consider the enablers of context-aware services in distributed environments and present a context management framework that is generic through its hierarchic ordering of context sources and extensible with multiple reasoning realizations. The article focuses on the architectural principles and reasoning methods of the framework",

Implementation of a high-bandwidth RF system in the 3-5 GHz band presents challenges that can be solved by circuit and system techniques. This article looks at the motivation and requirements for a WiMedia-compliant UWB system implemented for a target application in wireless video transmission. It explores the circuit-level trade-offs in CMOS radio and some of the system-level methods, such as selection diversity and equal-gain combining, used to increase robustness in multipath and interference environments. The radio (S. Lo, 2006) is part of a two-chip solution that includes a digital baseband chip that implements the WiMedia-compliant PHY and MAC. The measured results of the 0.18 mum CMOS UWB transceiver demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques in the final RF and system performance",

Due to the advent of the newly announced H.264, a generic problem of standard incompatibility has appeared between H.264 and prevalent MPEG-x video standards, which must be resolved on both algorithmic and architectural levels. Furthermore, several low-power techniques targeted at achieving lower memory requirements and processing cycles are also described and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Policy refinement is meant to derive low-level enforceable policies from high-level guidelines. Although recent advances have been made to solve this open problem, the holistic implications confronting systematic policy refinement have not been explicitly addressed. This article presents a methodological approach towards the policy refinement problem. We provide a generic procedure to define policy hierarchies, which is essential to achieving systematic policy refinement. We also provide the considerations while defining high-level guidelines, and describe a policy refinement framework that formalizes the requirements to refine high-level guidelines into executable policies. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with a scenario applied to the quality of service (QoS) management domain",

      "abstract": "Given the tremendous growth in mobile voice and data usage and the emergence of new multifunction, multiradio handheld devices, there is an emerging interest in seamless mobility - applications and services that provide service portability and application persistence across multiple network connections. Seamless mobility ultimately allows users to transparently access all of their data and services in a consistent method. This article describes an implementation of a network-based architecture for seamless mobility services that supports the full range of applications voice, data, video, and messaging - using bimode devices that interface to both Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) networks. This solution provides advanced functionality to existing cellular devices, while providing a solid migration path to full IP-based multimedia services. The solution relies on network-based interfaces and systems, providing a multinetwork-capable, scalable solution with a unified service experience for the user from a single device",

The axiom, \"one size doesn't fit all,\" continues to stand firmly to this day. In light of this, we introduce a new routing design concept - the component approach. We examine existing routing protocols and break them down into smaller building blocks, namely, routing components. The component analysis and classification results show that most routing protocols can be functionally decomposed into several basic routing components. This fact indicates that it is feasible to design a component-based routing (CBR) protocol. With a different realization for each basic routing component, it is expected that the routing behavior of CBR can be tailored to different application profiles and time-varying environment parameters at a reasonable cost",

      "abstract": "The development of the wireless body area sensor network (BASN) is imperative for modern telemedicine and m-health, but security remains a formidable challenge yet to be resolved. As nodes of BASN are expected to be interconnected on or in the human body, the body itself can form an inherently secure communication pathway that is unavailable to all other kinds of wireless networks. This article explores the use of this conduit in the security mechanism of BASN; that is, by a biometrics approach that uses an intrinsic characteristic of the human body as the authentication identity or the means of securing the distribution of a cipher key to secure inter-BASN communications. The method was tested on 99 subjects with 838 segments of simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram. By using the interpulse interval (IPI) as the biometric trait, the system achieved a minimum half total error rate of 2.58 percent when the IPIs measured from signals, which were sampled at 1000 Hz, were coded into 128-bit binary sequences. The study opens up a few key issues for future investigation, including compensation schemes for the asynchrony of different channels, coding schemes, and other suitable biometric traits.",

      "abstract": "The secure transport of messages was the concern of many early civilizations. Since then, different methods have been developed to assure that only the sender and the addressee would be able to read a message, while it would be illegible or without significant meaning to a third party. Today, this practice continues with more fervor. Wireless, wired, and optical communication networks are able to transport unimaginable amounts of data and thus privacy of information and security of the network are of the utmost concern because a good part of the transported information may be very sensitive and/or confidential. Confidentiality of information has been particularly popularized with the explosive growth of the Internet, which has touched most people's lives. However, from the outset, the Internet was based on open network architecture with computer-based nodes and without network security, and thus was vulnerable to attackers and hackers. Wireless networks transmit in unguarded space and thus are also subject to malicious actors. Dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) optical networks transport a massive aggregate traffic that has exceeded terabits per second per single fiber; therefore, the issues of information privacy and network security are equally important. As a result, the development of unbreakable cipher keys, cipher-key distribution, identification of malicious actors, source authentication, physical-link signature identification, countermeasures, and so forth has been the major thrust of research efforts with regard to cyber-security. This article focuses on cryptography, and is the first of a series of three articles on cryptography and security in communications. Subsequent articles will cover wireless and IP network security, as well as optical network security, quantum cryptography, and quantum-key distribution processes specific to optical networks.",

Applications in these domains generate large amounts of jobs, with individual jobs having only modest resource requirements. In this article, a novel architecture to realize a highly scalable and flexible platform for consumer-oriented grids is proposed. The architecture is based on an optical burst switched network, complemented with an advanced control and signaling plane. The architecture, functionality, and interfaces of all the relevant entities are presented and issues, current initiatives, and future directions for the control and management of these grid networks are discussed.",

They can grow, reduce in size, fragment, and dismantle as desired. The dynamic and very flexible nature of ad hoc networks can be taken to a further level of sophistication by allowing these networks to retune and adapt themselves according to prevailing network conditions. We are interested in scenarios in which ad hoc nodes must reconfigure as part of a network-wide adaptation process such that network-wide consensus is needed before any change can take place. We present an elegant solution for attaining global consensus in MANETs based on the social science theory of the diffusion of innovations. We present results of the application of this novel approach to an ad hoc network with an adaptive reconfigurable network layer.",

Media delivery is no longer an end-to-end service that only uses the network as an IP transport. Instead, these concepts create a service-aware network and provide customized delivery support through per-service overlay networks. They also integrate specialized processing nodes as part of the delivery topology, which include transcoders but also more complex processors, such as localized program insertions or personalized spam control. This article describes the underlying concepts and how these new network capabilities for media delivery services are requested, invoked, and managed",

      "abstract": "Several of the new applications in high-performance networks are of the multicast traffic type. Since such networks employ an optical network infrastructure, and since most of these applications require subwavelength bandwidth, several streams are usually groomed on the same wavelength. This article presents an account of recent advances in the design of optical networks for multicast traffic grooming in WDM mesh networks. The article addresses network design and session provisioning under both static and dynamic multicast traffic. Under static traffic conditions, the objective is to accommodate a given set of multicast traffic demands, while minimizing the implementation cost. Optimal and heuristic solution techniques for mesh network topologies are presented. Under dynamic traffic conditions, techniques for dynamic routing and session provisioning of multicast sessions whose objective is to minimize session blocking probabilities are explained. The article also presents a number of open research issues",

In the interest of creating a \"ubiquitous\" service platform (USP) for heterogeneous networking environments, we address important issues related to \"service convergence\" and \"service mobility.\" The objectives of our work are threefold: firstly, making services available across different administrative and technology domains; secondly, facilitating dynamic provision of services that can be discovered and used without preconfigured subscription; and lastly, making services movable in geographical and topological locations. We build our USP architecture over the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) infrastructure, making extensions where the current IMS falls short as a generalized service platform while exploiting its strengths, such as support for user roaming and session mobility.

      "abstract": "Mobile multimedia applications require networks that optimally allocate resources and adapt to dynamically changing environments. Cross-layer design (CLD) is a new paradigm that addresses this challenge by optimizing communication network architectures across traditional layer boundaries. In this article we discuss the relevant technical challenges of CLD and focus on application-driven CLD for video streaming over wireless networks. We propose a cross-layer optimization strategy that jointly optimizes the application layer, data link layer, and physical layer of the protocol stack using an application-oriented objective function in order to maximize user satisfaction. In our experiments we demonstrate the performance gain achievable with this approach. We also explore the trade-off between performance gain and additional computation and communication cost introduced by cross-layer optimization. Finally, we outline future research challenges in CLD.",

The service plane bridges domains, establishes trust, and exposes control to credited users/applications while preventing unauthorized access and resource theft. The authentication, authorization, and accounting subsystem and the dynamic resource allocation controller are the two defining building blocks of our service plane. In concert, they act upon an interconnection request or a restoration request according to application requirements, security credentials, and domain-resident policy. We have experimented with such service plane in an optical, large-scale testbed featuring two hubs (NetherLight in Amsterdam, StarLight in Chicago) and attached network clouds, each representing an independent domain. The dynamic interconnection of the heterogeneous domains occurred at Layer 1. The interconnections ultimately resulted in an optical end-to-end path (lightpath) for use by the requesting grid application.",

      "abstract": "The restricted audio quality of today's telephone networks is mainly due to the narrowband (NB) limitation to the frequency range from about 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. Meanwhile, codecs for wideband (WB) telephony (50 Hz to 7 kHz) exist with significantly improved speech intelligibility and naturalness. However, the broad introduction of wideband speech coding requires strong efforts of both network operators and their customers because many elements of the networks (i.e., terminals and network nodes) have to be modified. An intermediate step to overcome the narrowband limitation can be achieved by applying artificial bandwidth extension (BWE) in the receiver. In this article we review the basic principles of bandwidth extension, and discuss several application scenarios in which both wideband coding and BWE complement each other. The introduction of BWE methods in terminals and networks may help to speed up the introduction of true wideband speech coding in the near future",

The proposed method consists of a burst assembly algorithm and burst transmission scheduling, and it works only at the ingress edge node. A mixed timer/burst-length-based assembly algorithm is considered for burst assembly, and bursts with different service classes are assembled simultaneously according to the algorithm. A burst-cluster is generated so that the bursts in the cluster are arranged in order from lowest priority to highest. Then the burst-cluster is transmitted according to the burst transmission scheduling. We also consider the application of burst-cluster transmission to delay-sensitive traffic. We evaluate by simulation the performance of the burst-cluster transmission for NSFNET. Numerical examples show that burst-cluster transmission succeeds in providing different service grades even though the burst loss probabilities of high-priority service classes are affected by the traffic load of low-priority ones",

      "abstract": "This article presents key enhancements to CDMA2000 1/spl times/EV-DO systems embodied in 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision A. These enhancements provide significant gains in spectral efficiency and substantial improvements in QoS support relative to 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision 0. In particular, 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision A approximately doubles the uplink spectral efficiency and doubles the number of terminals with delay-sensitive applications that can be simultaneously supported on the system. It provides substantial reduction in latencies (approximately 50 percent) during both connection setup and the connected state. It offers comprehensive network control over terminal and application performance to enable the desired trade-offs between capacity and latency/ fairness, thereby providing full QoS support and enhanced user experience. It also provides coverage improvement (approximately 1.5 dB) relative to 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision 0. This enables operators to offer services such as VoIP, video telephony, mobile network gaming, push-to-talk, Web browsing, file transfer, and video on demand to a larger number of simultaneous users. The 1/spl times/EV-DO Revision A network can provide downlink sector capacity of 1500 kb/s and uplink capacity of 500 kb/s (two-way receive diversity) or 1200 kb/s (four-way receive diversity) with 16 active users per sector, using just 1.25 MHz of the spectrum.",

      "abstract": "Digital video reception is emerging as the latest feature toward multimedia-enriched handheld devices. Mobile battery-operated devices require small-size tuners that consume low power and are amenable to single-chip integration with the baseband demodulator. Following an overview of the system and circuit-level implementation challenges of mobile TV standards such as DVB-H and T-DMB, this article presents a dual-band direct conversion tuner for DVB-H. Architecture and circuit trade-offs are discussed, and detailed measurements are presented. The tuner occupies 9.7 mm<sup>2</sup> and achieves a 4 dB NF at both UHF and L-band, eliminating the need for an external LNA. By using a fractional-TV synthesizer both 470-890 MHz and 1.4-1.8 GHz bands are supported, while achieving an integrated phase noise of less than -41 dBc. Sixth-order low-pass filters support channel bandwidths from 4 to 10 MHz",

      "abstract": "In the last two decades we have witnessed the tremendous success of the Internet and its technologies. Wireless Internet access becomes important to continue this success. However, wireless Internet access suffers from limited battery power, limited bandwidth, high mobility, and an increasing degree of heterogeneity. Cache mechanisms have been proposed to improve access latency, reduce battery power consumption, and reduce bandwidth usage in the wireless Internet. In this article we discuss issues in wireless Internet caching. In particular, we classify and survey cache access mechanisms and replacement algorithms, which should be designed considering both the limitations of wireless networks/devices and heterogeneity of the future wireless Internet.",

      "abstract": "The absence of electrical regenerators in transparent WDM networks significantly contributes to reduce the overall network cost. In transparent WDM networks, a proper resource allocation requires that the presence of physical impairments in routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) and lightpath provisioning be taken into account. In this article a centralized, a hybrid centralized-distributed and two distributed approaches that integrate information about most relevant physical impairments in RWA and lightpath provisioning are presented and assessed. Both centralized and hybrid approaches perform a centralized path computation at the management-plane level, utilizing physical impairment information, while the lightpath provisioning is done by the management plane or the control plane, respectively. The distributed approaches fall entirely within the scope of the ASON/GMPLS control plane. For these two approaches, we provide functional requirements, architectural functional blocks, and protocol extensions for implementing either an impairment-aware real-time RWA, or a lightpath provisioning based on impairment-aware signaling.",

It appears that the transition from narrowband to wideband signals is not a trivial task, but can rather be seen as a challenge, as acoustic quality requirements, scalability and computational limitations have to be faced at the same time. This article presents key examples to address the transition issue as well as proposals for low-complexity implementations of acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction",

Cognitive networks are motivated by the complexity, heterogeneity, and reliability requirements of tomorrow's networks, which are increasingly expected to self-organize to meet user and application objectives. We compare and contrast cognitive networks with related research on cognitive radios and cross-layer design. By defining cognitive networks, examining their relationship to other technologies, discussing critical design issues, and providing a framework for implementation, we aim to establish a foundation for further research and discussion",

G-PON is a powerful and flexible optical access system with various options to accommodate many services and interface types. In order to provide guidance to vendors on the key options required by operators at this time and hence speed up early volumes for large field trials and deployments, many of the major worldwide access carriers (AT&amp;T, BT, DT, FT, KT, NTT, and TI) have developed a common technical specification (CTS) for G-PON systems. This article describes the G-PON standard and underlines the scope and results of the CTS",

We begin by illustrating the terms service level agreement and service level specification defined by the IETF. We then discuss the working of the existing service negotiation protocols with respect to generic network architecture. Following that, we enumerate a list of characteristics desired in an ideal service negotiation protocol and draw a comparison between the various protocols based on this list. We conclude the article by discussing possible future research directions in this area.",

Ubiquitous technologies create significant opportunities not only for indoor, but also for outdoor anytime and anywhere assistance. However, outdoor emergency assistance requires that we address several challenging aspects, from elder location tracking and health condition monitoring to the formation of ad hoc assistance groups capable of assisting elders in need of help. This article focuses on the creation and management of outdoor assistance teams and proposes a group management system, AGAPE, that exploits visibility of location and group/user/device profile information as a key principle to trigger and control the team formation and team member interactions required to coordinate emergency activities.",

In next-generation mobile systems, novel solutions for user-centric service discovery are crucial to provide personalized views of only the services of potential interest. The service view personalization should be based on user context, for example, user preferences, access device capabilities, and environment conditions, and should exploit semantic technologies to allow flexible matching between requirements and capabilities in open and dynamic deployment scenarios. Our MIDAS middleware exemplifies how to exploit context awareness based on user/device/service profile metadata and semantic-based matchmaking",

      "abstract": "As network traffic showed explosive growth in the 1990s, layer 2 services became a significant revenue source for service providers. Unfortunately, since technology development did not progress in a timely and synchronized manner, many service providers now need to manage multiple networks that are optimized for different services (voice, ATM, IP, etc.). In addition, these networks may share part of their resources in a layered manner, adding one network on top of the other one (e.g., IP over ATM), which results in overly complicated operation and inefficient use of network resources. Multiprotocol label switching provides a scalable solution for evolving service providers' multiple \"service networks\" into a unified \"multiservice network.\" To make this transition happen, the one critical evolutionary process necessary is to carry the existing layer 1 TDM and layer 2 (ATM, frame relay, and Ethernet) traffic across MPLS core networks. This has been made possible by standardization work in the Internet Engineering Task Force (http://www.ictf.org), and has been successfully deployed by a number of service providers around the world. In this article the pre-MPLS methods of network operation for multiple services are addressed, followed by an introduction to MPLS, and the layer 1 and layer 2 over MPLS architecture is provided in detail",

In doing so, the characteristics of the operating environment, including the MAC and PHY layers, have to be taken into account as well. In this article we consider activity management of sensor nodes in a beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4-compliant network. Activity management is performed through lightweight probabilistic control of the duration of sleep and service periods of individual sensors. We present two distributed activity management policies which are capable of achieving and maintaining the desired network reliability while maximizing the lifetime of the entire network.",

      "abstract": "Applications using traditional protocol stacks (e.g., TCP/IP) from wired networks do not function efficiently in mobile wireless environments. This is primarily due to the layered architecture and implementation of protocol stacks. One mechanism to improve the efficiency of the stack is cross-layer feedback, that is, making information from within one layer available to another layer of the stack. For example, TCP retransmissions can be reduced by making it aware of network disconnections or handoff events. We highlight the need for a cross-layer feedback architecture and identify key design goals for an architecture. We present our ECLAIR architecture, which satisfies these design goals. We describe a prototype implementation that validates ECLAIR. We also discuss other cross-layer architectures and provide a cross-layer design guide.",

OS exploits channel variations to maximize wireless throughput. We present a general background of OS schemes and then propose an OS scheme making an optimum trade-off between throughput and fairness, while maintaining stability in different channel environments and guaranteeing minimum service to multiple queues active concurrently at a given user.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand of wireless services associated with the scarcity of the radio spectrum and the trend to provide end-to-end QoS in emerging and future applications calls for the design of spectrally efficient systems with QoS support. To fulfill these two requirements of spectral efficiency and QoS provision in the highly dynamic environment of mobile radio requires the collaboration of several layers in the system as well as the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas. In a packet network, one important component to achieve the aforementioned efficiency goals is a properly designed scheduling algorithm. Using an information-theoretic framework, we present an overview of the issues associated with the design of packet scheduling algorithms and review several proposed solutions. The article focuses on the advantages of a cross-layer approach to the resource allocation problem and identifies the trade-offs associated with the increased signaling needs. Also, we thoroughly discuss the additional degrees of freedom that multiple transmit and receive antennas can provide",

At the physical layer, we take the MIMO diversity schemes as well its AMC into account. At the data-link layer, our focus is on how this physical-layer infrastructure influences the real-time multimedia QoS provisioning performance such as delay-bound violation and buffer-overflow probabilities. To achieve this goal, we first model the physical-layer service process as a finite state Markov chain. Based on this FSMC model, we then characterize the QoS performance at the data-link layer using the effective capacity approach, which turns out to be critically important for the statistical QoS guarantees in mobile wireless networks. The numerical and simulation results obtained demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer model can efficiently characterize the interaction between the physical layer infrastructure and upper layer protocols' QoS provisioning performance.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic nature of ad hoc networks makes system design a challenging task. Mobile ad hoc networks suffer from severe performance problems due to the shared, interference-prone, and unreliable medium. Routes can be unstable due to mobility and energy can be a limiting factor for typical devices such as PDAs, mobile phones, and sensor nodes. In such environments cross-layer architectures are a promising new approach, as they can adapt protocol behavior to changing networking conditions. This article introduces CrossTalk, a cross-layer architecture that aims at achieving global objectives with local behavior. It further compares CrossTalk with other cross-layer architectures proposed. Finally, it analyzes the quality of the information provided by the architecture and presents a reference application to demonstrate the effectiveness of the general approach.",

      "abstract": "Service level agreements are at the core of the business relationship between service providers and their customers. Service level monitoring is necessary to validate and ensure that service levels are indeed adhered to. One key tool for this is threshold crossing alerts. TCAs can notify a service provider that a certain parameter has exceeded a certain threshold value, directing attention to those areas where preventive action needs to be taken. This article presents a protocol and an architecture that implements a new category of TCAs for parameters that need to be aggregated across a network, as opposed to parameters that can be observed from a single device; for example, \"average utilization across all links in a network\" as opposed to \"utilization of a particular link.\" Although highly useful, such parameters are rarely subjected to SLAs today, due to the lack of effective monitoring technology. Our system fills this gap. It does so in a manner that is decentralized inside the network and does not rely on a more traditional centralized management architecture. We focus on business application aspects, as well as the robustness and accuracy properties of our system",

We compare the control and management approaches adopted in each of these networks and analyze their capabilities vis-a-vis the functional requirements of grid computing applications. Grid computing is increasingly on the rise to meet the massive processing and storage demands of a new class of e-science physics applications that may generate and require the processing of data sets reaching terabytes per day. The requirements of these applications challenge the limitations of the networking technologies that are in place today. In particular, the area of network management and control is undergoing significant developments in order to meet the demands of these applications. It is the purpose of this article to share our experiences in the deployment of the GMPLS control plane in these experimental optical networks. It is our belief that these and similar efforts will result in significant progress toward enabling connection-oriented high-performance networking. This new paradigm will encompass grid computing applications as well as commercial, health, and entertainment services, thus making it useful to the public at large.",

      "abstract": "Today, the policy-based management approach is recognized as an efficient solution to simplify the complex task of managing and controlling networks. To this end, the IETF has introduced a reference framework to build PBM systems. However, this framework only addresses the provisioning of relatively long validity period services based on pre-defined service level agreements. Furthermore, very little work addresses the scalability properties of the instantiation of this framework in a real network. This work aims to extend the IETF PBM framework in order to support dynamic provisioning of short term services (end system signaling) as well as an instantiation scheme that is scalable (distributed provisioning of edge routers). This instantiation scheme is based on the distribution of the provisioning process while keeping centralized only the parts that involve critical resources, that is, the bandwidth brokerage. The performance properties of the proposed scheme are then demonstrated throughout both extensive experimentation and a short analytical study. The results of this work are intended to be used as a guideline to help network operators to design scalable PBM system in order to offer to their customers services with QoS assurance in an on-demand basis.",

Looking at the large collection of existing and emerging standards supporting the wireless systems that are available on the market, one has to wonder whether the wireless community really need all of these standards. After examining both why and how standards are created, we can say that the more standards available, whether they are competing or complementary, the greater the choices for the market, and thus the greater the chance the market will have access to the best technologies to suit its need. The proliferation of standards in the long term fosters competition, lowers prices to consumers, and allows for innovation in other areas",

The prototype, based on a distributed architecture, includes capabilities for policy creation and management, dynamic policy negotiation, and dynamic policy provisioning. The policy negotiation facilitates the rapid deployment of a coalition network while the dynamic policy provisioning automates the configuration and management of network services including firewalls, virtual private network connections, routing, quality of service (QoS), and domain name services. Such a PBNM system enhances an organization's ability to react to network incidents identified by a network situational awareness assessment. Although the focus of the current research is a military coalition environment, the system can be used in any distributed enterprise or collaborative environment",

      "abstract": "Numerous key management schemes have been proposed for sensor networks. The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme. Finally, we outline future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Handoff performance with mobile IPv6 strongly depends on the efficiency of IP-layer configuration mechanisms as well as the flexibility of mobile nodes to schedule and parallelize their signaling. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the handoff performance with standard IPv6 protocols and mobile IPv6, and identifies several sources for delay. Some of the delays are already well known, but an optimized and widely applicable handoff approach is yet to be found. While substantial efforts are currently being invested into localized mobility-management architectures, such approaches feature poor scalability and limited deployability given their requirements in terms of financial investments and coordination across administrative borders. This article hence explores a number of promising IPv6 and end-to-end mobile IPv6 optimization proposals, some of which are currently under standardization within the IETF, and elaborates how a combination of those can significantly improve handoff experience without loss of scalability. The article further shows that the optimizations may not only improve reactive handoff performance, but also facilitate efficient proactive handoff management",

      "abstract": "In recent years, sensor networks have transitioned from being objects of academic research interest to a technology that is frequently being deployed in real-life applications and rapidly being commercialized. However, energy consumption continues to remain a barrier challenge in many sensor network applications that require long lifetimes. Battery-operated sensor nodes have limited energy storage capability due to small form-factors, or operate in environments that rule out frequent energy replenishment, resulting in a mismatch between the available energy budget for system operation and the required energy budget to obtain desired lifetimes. This article surveys several techniques that show promise in addressing and alleviating this energy consumption challenge. In addition to describing recent advances in energy-aware platforms for information processing and communication protocols for sensor collaboration, the article also looks at emerging, hitherto largely unexplored techniques, such as the use of environmental energy harvesting and the optimization of the energy consumed during sensing.",

      "abstract": "Existing quality of service differentiation schemes for today's IP over point-to-point optical WDM networks take advantage of electronic RAM to implement traffic management algorithms in order to isolate the service classes. Since practical optical RAM is not available, these techniques are not suitable for a future all-optical network. Hence, new schemes are needed to support QoS differentiation in optical packet-switched (OPS) networks. In this article we first present an overview of existing QoS differentiation mechanisms suitable for asynchronous bufferless OPS. We then compare the performance of the presented schemes and qualitatively discuss implementation issues, in order to evaluate the mechanisms. In particular, we present an evaluation framework, which quantifies the throughput reduction observed when migrating from a best effort scenario to a service-differentiated scenario. Our study shows that preemption-based schemes have the best performance, but also the highest implementation complexity",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of mobile applications in recent years has created a need for wideband wireless communication. The only predictable trend is that data-rate and QoS requirements will increase rapidly. This demand is pushing time-division-synchronous code-division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) to evolve in order to provide higher and higher data rates. This article presents the evolution map from TD-SCDMA to future terrestrial universal radio environment (FuTURE) TDD in China. The evolution includes four phases: low chip rate (LCR), high-speed downlink/uplink packet access (HSxPA)/TD-SCDMA EV 1x, long-term evolution (LTE) TDD, and FuTURE beyond 3G TDD. The main features of each phase are described in detail. By introducing the new technologies into the system step by step, for example, multiple input and multiple output (MIMO), orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), TD-SCDMA system can evolve to FuTURE B3G TDD smoothly, and provide high-data-rate services with low cost, low latency, and improved coverage and capacity.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of cdma2000 1xEV-DO systems to multicarrier EV-DO (supported by 1xEV-DO Revision B) is discussed in this article. Multicarrier EV-DO offers a backward-compatible upgrade to leverage existing 1xEV-DO networks and terminals. It allows a software upgrade to multicarrier EV-DO using 1xEV-DO Revision A base station hardware. Multicarrier operation achieves higher efficiencies relative to single-carrier by exploiting channel frequency selectivity, improved transmit efficiencies on the reverse link, and adaptive load balancing across carriers. Multicarrier EV-DO enables very high-speed download, high-resolution video telephony, and improved user experience with concurrent applications. The sources of higher efficiency are discussed in detail in this article. It also enables hybrid frequency reuse deployment scenarios that enable spectrally efficient operation and significant improvement in edge coverage performance with hardware-efficient implementations. The evolved wider bandwidth systems (up to 20 MHz) based on multicarrier EV-DO offer operators a cost-effective solution that competes favorably with other technologies.",

The specified solution allows TETRA terminals to interface to the TETRA Switching and Management Infrastructure (SwMI) over a broadband WLAN radio access network, instead of the conventional narrowband TETRA radio network. These terminals are fully interoperable with conventional TETRA terminals and can employ all TETRA services, including group calls, short data messaging, packet data, and so forth. In addition, however, such terminals can support a range of brand new capabilities enabled by the WLAN, such as broadband data services, true concurrent voice and data services, simultaneous reception of many group calls, reduced call setup and voice transmission delays, improved voice quality, and so forth. The specified solution is solely based on IP multicast and Voice-over-IP (VoIP) technologies and thus fits ideally to the all-IP architecture being introduced by the MESA project for the next generation of public safety and disaster relief communication systems.",

To address the shortcomings in today's GMPLS over wavelength-routed optical networks, a new network architecture called polymorphous, agile, and transparent optical networks (PATON) is proposed. PATON uses polymorphous optical burst switching (POBS) to seamlessly integrate different signaling, switching, and reservation schemes. The main features of PATON, along with its benefits as well as design and implementation challenges, are also described. Finally, both qualitative and quantitative performance comparisons of POBS with the two representative IP/GMPLS/OCS approaches are provided",

The TG members have made progress with interoperability by analyzing the International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunications (ITU-T) Recommendations to develop test plans and demonstrate implementations that work across multiple vendors' OLTs and ONTs. This article defines interoperability and conformance and describes the FSAN's interoperability program to develop common test plans. It describes recent and planned G-PON interoperability demonstrations, as well as current challenges facing the industry.",

      "abstract": "Network management for optical networks faces additional security challenges that arise by using transparent optical network components in communication systems. While some available management mechanisms are applicable to different types of network architectures, many of these are not adequate for all-optical networks. These have unique features and requirements in terms of security and quality of service, thus requiring a much more targeted approach in terms of network management. In this article we consider management issues with particular emphasis on complications that arise due to the unique characteristics and peculiar behaviors of transparent network components. In particular, signal quality monitoring is still a major complication in all-optical networks. Despite new methods for detection and localization of attacks having been proposed, no robust standards or techniques exist to date for guaranteeing the quality of service in these networks. Therefore, sophisticated mechanisms that assist in managing and assessing the proper function of transparent network components are highly desirable. Accordingly, we present an algorithm for multiple attack localization and identification that can participate in some tasks for fault management of all-optical networks",

      "abstract": "There is a continuing need for increased capacity for military applications, especially in network-centric operational concepts that promote the use of information as fundamental for gaining superiority on the battlefield. As an example, the access to, and distribution of, sensor data is a major tenet of network-centric warfare and yet radio frequency (RF) links will struggle to provide the needed capacity. Free-space optical communications (FSOC) has the potential to meet these emerging military needs by offering dramatic increases in capacity. However, there are many technical challenges al multiple layers of the communications protocol stack. This article describes these challenges and discusses some mitigation approaches to provide a path to realizing this capability on the battlefield",

      "abstract": "An open diversity architecture for a cooperating broadcast wireless network is presented that exploits the strengths of the existing digital broadcast standards. Different diversity techniques for broadcast networks that will minimize the complexity of broadcast systems and improve received SNR of broadcast signals are described. Resulting digital broadcast networks could require fewer transmitter sites and thus be more cost effective with less environmental impact. Transmit diversity is particularly investigated since it obviates the major disadvantage of receive diversity being the difficulty of locating two receive antennas far enough apart in a small mobile device. The schemes examined here are compatible with existing broadcast and cellular telecom standards, and can be incorporated into existing systems without change",

      "abstract": "As mobile wireless networks increase in popularity and pervasiveness, we are faced with the challenge of combining a diverse number of wireless networks. The fourth generation of wireless communications is expected to integrate a potentially large number of heterogeneous wireless technologies in what could be considered a huge step forward toward universal seamless access. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of reliable horizontal (intrasystem) and vertical (intersystem) handoff schemes. Efficient handoff schemes enhance quality of service and provide flawless mobility. This article presents different and novel aspects of handoff and discusses handoff related issues of fourth generation systems. Desirable handoff features are presented. Handoff decisions, radio link transfer, and channel assignment are described as stages of the complete handoff process. A vertical handoff decision function, which enables devices to assign weights to different network parameters, is also presented",

      "abstract": "Recently, a number of new research initiatives, most notably UCLPv2 and GENI, have promoted the dynamic partition of physical network resources (infrastructure) as the means to operate the network, and to implement new protocols and services. This has led to a number of open issues such as resource discovery, implementation of resource partitioning, and the aggregation of resources to create arbitrary network topologies. To us, the key issue is the design of a mechanism to trade, acquire, and control network resources, given a choice of providers of physical resources (infrastructure providers). In this article we present an architecture that allows physical resources to be traded, while granting users controlled access to the acquired resources via a policy enforcement mechanism. In addition, it allows resource provider domains to be linked via configurable, provider-neutral resource exchange points that are the physical resource equivalents of the pooling point, or Internet exchange point (IXP). We demonstrate how our trading system will operate by presenting a use case in which a network topology is constructed using resources from multiple providers, be it Internet service providers (ISPs), or National Research Experimental Network (NREN) providers. The use case also shows how a dynamic reconfiguration can be effected by the customer though the use of simple access control policies, without involving the provider",

They aim at improving the overall network design by combining the advantages of different technologies while avoiding their disadvantages. In order to structure this developing research field, we classify such hybrid architectures based on the degree of interaction and integration of the network technologies. Also, we discuss the three classes and their main representatives regarding key characteristics, performance benefits, and realization complexity. Finally, we highlight two hybrid architectures and show their key benefits compared to the respective non-hybrid architectures through a dimensioning case study.",

Classic network monitoring generally ensures that each network element, network segment, and subnetwork is functioning reliably, and may also encompass routing and reachability across different network domains. IPTV service assurance can encompass much more, including subscriber management and authorization, capacity management, perceived video picture quality, and error correction and concealment; accomplished through integrated test and monitoring for rapid resolution of customer complaints. This is all needed to ensure that the customer has an overall video quality of experience (QoE) at least as enjoyable as current TV delivery methods",

Under this strategy, the introduction and development of eight (8) new IT services are expected to encourage investment in three (3) key network infrastructures, which in turn will promote the development of nine (9) new growth engines, including equipment, terminal, software, contents, and so on. Moreover, each of the 20 (8 + 3 + 9) sectors of the IT839 Strategy will reap synergistic effects as a result of concurrent growth through cooperation among the government, private sector, and research institutes. The IT839 Strategy is anchored on the belief that IT will bring about qualitative changes in the economic and social paradigm, ultimately aiming to realize a ubiquitous world by forming a virtual circle of developing new services, infrastructures, and growth engines.",

      "abstract": "Cooperation among single-antenna transceivers and formation of distributed antenna arrays has recently attracted considerable interest. Such distributed antenna arrays are envisioned to provide resistance to slow wireless fading and improve performance of point-to-point wireless communication across various dimensions. Despite the plethora of recently proposed theoretical approaches that promise gains due to diversity at the physical layer though cooperation (cooperative diversity), there is not much work in the implementation of cooperative antenna arrays with existing wireless transceivers. In this article we summarize the main challenges in implementation of cooperative diversity antenna arrays for realistic wireless networks. We then present the basic building blocks of a cooperative diversity demonstration realized in the lab, utilizing commodity radio hardware. Our work sheds light onto the synergies needed between the physical, link, and routing layers that significantly simplify the overall network operation and decrease the transceiver complexity in cooperative diversity antenna arrays, making feasible the utilization of (existing) commodity radio hardware",

      "abstract": "This article provides the principles and practice of how interference cancellation can be implemented on the EV-DO Rev A reverse link. It is shown that applying interference cancellation to CDMA achieves the multiple access channel sum rate capacity for either frame synchronous or asynchronous users. The per user SINR gain from space-time interference cancellation translates directly into a CDMA capacity gain of the same factor, allowing EV-DO Rev A to support more users with higher data rates. We demonstrate how interference cancellation can be added to base station processing without modifying user terminals, EV-DO standards, or network coverage. We present commercially viable receiver architectures for implementing interference cancellation with the asynchronism and H-ARQ of EV-DO RevA, and explain why closed loop power control can operate the same way it does today. Network level simulations over a wide range of channels confirm that interference cancellation offers significant capacity gains for all users, while maintaining the same link budget and system stability.",

      "abstract": "With the information age in full and rapid development, users are becoming accustomed to having immediate access to information. Users demand more capabilities from every kind of electronic device: more processing power, more features, and better connectivity. Users are also realizing the benefits of collaborating with others in their communities to help expand the body of knowledge. One user that understands the benefits of information sharing is the United States Department of Defense. The DoD's Network-Centric Enterprise Services initiative, along with the concept of pushing the \"power to the edge,\" aims to enable end users with maximum situational awareness and the most comprehensive battlespace, all in a secure networking environment. Providing so much data and capabilities to the end user, however, will require an increase in communications capability and efficiency. To address increased capability needs, the DoD is continually developing and enhancing the global information grid (GIG) throughout its various \"layers\" of communication infrastructure. One such layer of infrastructure involves the use of cooperative low Earth orbiting satellites for efficient multicasting communications. In this article we review the network-centric concept and the GIG infrastructure. We then discuss the potential benefits to adding a low Earth orbit satellite communications infrastructure to the GIG model. Finally, we show how multicasting protocols can enhance the efficiency within the GIG and reduce some of the long-haul communications burdens",

      "abstract": "Conventional wireless sensor networks rely mostly on simple scalar data (such as temperature or humidity) and specialize in single-purpose applications. Taking a fundamental departure, in this article we motivate information-rich wireless video sensor networks that emulate the compound eyes found in certain arthropods. Although constrained by scarce resources, sensor nodes can only serve extremely low-resolution video streams; the availability of vast amount of such streams due to deployment redundance can suffice for the need of information hungry applications. Unfortunately, the unique characteristics of wireless video sensor networks will introduce novel uncertainty-driven challenges in the information-intensive and yet resource-constrained environment. Correspondingly, we describe key research problems in the areas of networking, security, sensor design, and video-data analysis",

      "abstract": "In this article the provision of integrated services from high-altitude platforms (HAPs) is discussed, and a flexible communication system for HAP-based communications is identified and analyzed, with particular attention to the delivery of broadband services from HAPs to highspeed trains. The high coding gain required by the proposed scenario is achieved through adaptive concatenated coding schemes, while smart antennas operating with adaptive beamforming algorithms are employed at the ground stations. The simulated system performance based on a multi-antenna model of the stratospheric channel is reported, and the use of HAPs in synergy with terrestrial and satellite systems is discussed.",

The emergence of multicore devices combining the functionality of ASSPs, GPPs, DSPs, and FPGAs into a single offering complicates the design choices in radio systems. The development team for any new advanced wireless product must now spend considerable effort evaluating whether a radio function traditionally performed on an ASIC would be better implemented differently. Design choices are expected to become even more difficult as the competition tighten between DSP and FPGA vendors in the various segments of the wireless markets",

Indeed, a fully realized MANET would be powerful in enabling highly mobile, highly responsive, and quickly deployable tactical forces. However, significant technical challenges remain before this realization is viable. Addressing these deficiencies is a significant task that will require the invention and adoption of new technology. The goal of this article is not to declare these capabilities impossible to achieve. Rather, it is to manage the expectation of the capabilities achievable in the foreseeable future through edification on the technical difficulties standing between current technology and the desired capabilities. This article provides an overview of the military MANET problem space, describing the ideal military MANET solution. Several deficiencies are highlighted that exist between MANET technologies and the desired capability. Identified technical issues include system-level architecture, routing (both interior and exterior), management, security, and medium access control (MAC), with an emphasis on the former two areas",

Reliability is a concern in every laser diode application, whether it is a simple $10 laser pointer or a space-qualified optical transmitter link. The commercial success of a laser supplier rests largely on his ability to develop a robust manufacturing process that consistently produces reliable devices combined with the quantitative assurances he can provide to his customers proving the reliability of his devices. Over the past two decades, laser diode reliability testing techniques and equipment have evolved to support the diverse development of laser diodes.",

      "abstract": "The layer 1 virtual private network (LlVPN) technology supports multiple user networks over a common carrier transport network. Emerging L1VPN services allow: L1VPNs to be built over multiple carrier networks; L1VPNs to lease or trade resources with each other; and users to reconfigure an L1VPN topology, and add or remove bandwidth. The trend is to offer increased flexibility and provide management functions as close to users as possible, while maintaining proper resource access right control. In this article two aspects of the L1VPN service and management architectures are discussed: management of carrier network partitions for L1VPNs, and L1VPN management by users. We present the carrier network partitioning at the network element (NE) and L1VPN levels. As an example, a transaction language one (TL1) proxy is developed to achieve carrier network partitioning at the NE level. The TL1 proxy is implemented without any modifications to the existing NE management system. On top of the TL1 proxy, a Web services (WS)-based L1VPN management tool is implemented. Carriers use the tool to partition resources at the L1VPN level by assigning resources, together with the WS-based management services for the resources, to L1VPNs. L1VPN administrators use the tool to receive resource partitions from multiple carriers and partner L1VPNs. Further resource partitioning or regrouping can be conducted on the received resources, and leasing or trading resources with partner LlVPNs is supported. These services offer a potential business model for a physical network broker. After the L1VPN administrators compose the use scenarios of resources, and make the use scenarios available to the L1VPN end users as WS, the end users reconfigure the L1VPN without intervention from the administrator. The tool accomplishes LlVPN management by users",

We survey the current proposals for cognitive radio deployment, and present a new, potentially more spectrally efficient model for a wireless channel employing cognitive radios; the cognitive radio channel. This channel models the simplest scenario in which a cognitive radio could be used and consists of a 2 Tx, 2 Rx wireless channel in which one transmitter knows the message of the other. We obtain fundamental limits on the communication possible over such a channel, and discuss future engineering and regulatory issues",

      "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are appealing to researchers due to their wide range of application potential in areas such as target detection and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and tactical systems. However, low sensing ranges result in dense networks and thus it becomes necessary to achieve an efficient medium-access protocol subject to power constraints. Various medium-access control (MAC) protocols with different objectives have been proposed for wireless sensor networks. In this article, we first outline the sensor network properties that are crucial for the design of MAC layer protocols. Then, we describe several MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks, emphasizing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we point out open research issues with regard to MAC layer design.",

      "abstract": "Delivering broadband services to fast moving users (e.g., in trains) involves both wired and wireless networks. In this article we demonstrate that a hierarchical wired Ethernet aggregation network in combination with Ethernet-based wireless access networks is an interesting approach for realizing broadband access to fast moving users. The focus of the article is on fast and autonomie setup and removal of tunnels in the Ethernet aggregation network for providing broadband services to trains. The resulting moving tunnels realize seamless connectivity for the users on a train with an efficient resource reservation in the aggregation network, A hybrid approach is presented, which allows tunnel-setup times to be minimized and provides accurate tunnel-setup triggers. A testbed has been set up to evaluate the hybrid approach and the results of this work are intended to be used as a guideline for network service providers on how to set up an Ethernet-based aggregation network for fast moving users",

      "abstract": "Customers of Internet service providers are increasingly interested in running applications such as voice over IP, video games, and commercial transactions. This, new range of applications cannot tolerate poor network performance (high delays or low available bandwidth) or network instability (periods of loss or variation in delay or available bandwidth). Unfortunately, routine events such as equipment failures or planned maintenance cause routing changes, which may lead to transient service disruptions or persistent performance problems. Operators of ISP networks are faced with the challenge of minimizing routing disruptions using current routing technology, which offers little control. In this article we discuss routing disruptions from an ISP perspective. First, we describe the causes and effects of routing changes. Then we provide a set of network design guidelines and operational practices that network operators can use to reduce the impact of routing changes in their network.",

      "abstract": "In this article we examine the challenges faced by data center administrators when deploying and configuring Web applications. We discuss how the configuration dependencies of these Web applications cut across software stacks, network layers, and middleware container boundaries. We argue that the deployment and configuration process requires the combined expertise from multiple domains such as application, middleware, network, security, reliability, and performance. We review the model-based tools available today to manage the configuration complexity of these applications and introduce a new tool that extends the existing state of the art by automatically generating actionable distributed deployment models using model transformation techniques. The key idea behind this new tool is the principle of separation of concerns: developers capture the logical structure of the application in a model, best practices experts define deployment model transformation rules, deployers specify the required deployment patterns, and an operator provides a model describing the data center resources. The tool automatically finds solutions based on these four inputs and executes the deployment.",

      "abstract": "One of the most effective techniques offering QoS routing is minimum interference routing. However, it is complex in terms of computation time and is not oriented toward improving the network protection level. In order to include better levels of protection, new minimum interference routing algorithms are necessary. Minimizing the failure recovery time is also a complex process involving different failure recovery phases. Some of these phases depend completely on correct routing selection, such as minimizing the failure notification time. The level of protection also involves other aspects, such as the amount of resources used. In this case shared backup techniques should be considered. Therefore, minimum interference techniques should also be modified in order to include sharing resources for protection in their objectives. These aspects are reviewed and analyzed in this article, and a new proposal combining minimum interference with fast protection using shared segment backups is introduced. Results show that our proposed method improves both minimization of the request rejection ratio and the percentage of bandwidth allocated to backup paths in networks with low and medium protection requirements.",

      "abstract": "The practical success of next-generation mobile systems such as 4G relics largely on its flexibility in providing adaptive and cost-effective services. Service discovery is an essential mechanism to achieve this goal. Based on the investigation of the existing service discovery protocols, this article proposes a new service discovery methodology for next-generation mobile systems: model-based service discovery or MBSD. By taking advantage of the object management group (OMG) model-driven architecture (MDA) technique, model-based service discovery (MBSD) can generate service description automatically and more precisely. Furthermore, if developed via MDA, the discovered services can be regenerated into their model format and as such facilitate the service re-engineering in a finer manner. The system architecture of MBSD and its operation are presented and implemented. The proposed methodology is validated via a mobile service scenario.",

Results of testing voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) as a next-generation network (NGN) application are presented and illustrate that effective NS/EP support is at risk during congestion possible in events requiring NS/EP services. The results also demonstrate substantial benefit of mitigating the risks with the types of differentiated service capabilities currently being advanced within the Internet engineering task force (IETF). The test results are shown to align with predictions from event simulation. Extending the event simulation to a more complex topology and application arrangement than those tested in the laboratory suggests the feasibility and means of ensuring effective NS/EP support.",

The reality, however, is that the resulting networks are not truly all-optical; all connections cannot be carried end-to-end solely in the optical domain. While a significant amount of regeneration can be eliminated through the deployment of new ultra-long-haul technology, a small amount is still required. We study the optical network design problem for realistic backbone networks, with a focus on the impact of regeneration",

To enable a smooth transition from legacy narrowband voice services, VMR-WB is also capable of processing conventional telephone-bandwidth speech. The VMR-WB codec is interoperable with AMR-WB at certain bit rates, thus eliminating quality degradation and additional delay due to transcoding",

      "abstract": "MPLS is being actively adopted as the core switching infrastructure at the intradomain level. This trend is mainly attributable to the undeniable potential of MPLS in terms of virtual private networks (VPNs) management, traffic engineering (TE), QoS delivery, path protection, and fast recovery from network failures. However, little progress has been made to attain the expected extension of MPLS label-switched paths (LSPs) across domain boundaries. Among the problems that remain unsolved is how to efficiently find and establish primary and protection interdomain LSPs for mission-critical services subject to QoS constraints. This article explores the major limitations hindering the deployment of these kinds of LSPs across multiple domains, in the context of the current interdomain network model. We describe the critical problems faced by the research community, and present our vision on how to rationally overcome some of the problems exposed. Our perspective is that we should be prepared for rather coarse-grained solutions as long as we need to coexist with the current interdomain network model",

      "abstract": "The vision of grid computing is to enable an arbitrary set of general-purpose computers to be recruited dynamically and be interconnected through a general-purpose network for the parallel execution of complex programs. The scale and ubiquity of the Internet makes it the natural network of choice for grid computing. However, for some applications, rate- and delay-guaranteed communication services are needed. These needs are driving the exploration of connection-oriented (CO) optical networks as a candidate for grid computing. In this article, we consider the suitability of CO networks equipped with generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) control-plane protocols for grid computing. We identify two areas in which current GMPLS implementations need enhancements to better support the needs of grid computing. First, we note a need to improve call setup delays by several orders of magnitude. We describe our proof-of-concept prototype implementation of a hardware-accelerated RSVP-TE engine that cuts setup delays from hundreds of milliseconds (typical in current equipment) to the order of microseconds. Second, noting the availability of different types of CO networks, we present a case for enhancements to control \"heterogeneous connections,\" that is, connections that traverse multiple types of CO networks. We describe a distributed signaling procedure for the setup of such connections.",

      "abstract": "Opportunistic networks are one of the most interesting evolutions of MANETs. In opportunistic networks, mobile nodes are enabled to communicate with each other even if a route connecting them never exists. Furthermore, nodes are not supposed to possess or acquire any knowledge about the network topology, which (instead) is necessary in traditional MANET routing protocols. Routes are built dynamically, while messages are en route between the sender and the destination(s), and any possible node can opportunistically be used as next hop, provided it is likely to bring the message closer to the final destination. These requirements make opportunistic networks a challenging and promising research field. In this article we survey the most interesting case studies related to opportunistic networking and discuss and organize a taxonomy for the main routing and forwarding approaches in this challenging environment. We finally envision further possible scenarios to make opportunistic networks part of the next-generation Internet",

      "abstract": "Currently, many large-scale, resource-intensive applications and services are being developed that can be supported only with high-performance, highly distributed, heterogeneous infrastructures, including grids. This type of infrastructure is particularly effective for supporting applications and services that must quickly adjust to continuously changing conditions. Such processes require the flexibility of highly adaptive, dynamic, and deterministic resource provisioning. One such architecture is described here. To enhance the performance and flexibility of distributed environments, an experimental architecture for optical dynamic intelligent network (ODIN) services has been designed to enable core optical network capabilities to extend to edge processes, including applications. This architecture allows those processes to directly address arid control core network resources, for example, individual lightpaths on demand. This approach supports flexible and deterministic communications by integrating signaled requirements with adjustable network resources. An experimental prototype of ODIN has been designed, developed, and implemented on several optical network testbeds.",

It is not sufficient that only the video codec or only the radio adapts to changes in the wireless link quality; efforts should be applied in both layers, and - if possible - synchronized. Also, the disturbing effect of possible background traffic over the same shared medium has to be taken into account. In this article we present a communication architecture for video streaming over 802.11 that is capable of adapting to changes in the link quality and sharing of the wireless channel in various use scenarios. Experimental results show that substantial improvements in the quality of the video can be obtained by applying link adaptation and cross-layer signaling techniques.",

      "abstract": "While the use of sinusoidal electromagnetic waves as information carriers is taken as one of the principal axioms of today's wireless system design, certain nonsinusoidal waves may further enrich the scope and capacity of modern wireless engineering. Two notable nonsinusoid examples are impulses and chaotic signals. The short temporal width of impulses has enabled applications such as ranging radars and ultra wideband (UWB). The complex nature of chaotic signals offers a new means of encrypted communication. Here we review a new circuit paradigm, the electrical soliton oscillator, which can self-generate both impulse and chaotic signals of very large bandwidth by leveraging the singular dynamics of a nonlinear wave known as the electrical soliton. By combining a nonlinear transmission line with a unique amplifier that can \"tame\" the inherently unruly dynamics of solitons, the oscillator self-generates a stable, periodic train of short impulses. If the taming functions of the amplifier are turned off, the circuit self-generates chaotic signals by positively exploiting solitons' unruly nature. While still in its early stages, this soliton circuit may one day serve as the heartbeat of both impulse and chaotic wireless systems",

Wireless patient monitoring has the potential to support these multiple and conflicting requirements. However, the current quality and reliability of patient monitoring have not been very satisfactory due to the unpredictable and spotty coverage of infrastructure-oriented wireless networks. Ad hoc wireless networks can be formed among mobile and wearable patient-monitoring devices for improving the coverage of patient monitoring when infrastructure-oriented networks are not accessible. In this article, we provide support for reliable wireless patient monitoring by presenting several protocols for power management of devices, assisted power control, and sleep strategy. The performance results show that high reliability of message delivery can be obtained while maintaining a level of power conservation.",

      "abstract": "Plastic optical fibers (POF) have been over-shadowed in the last decade by the success of glass optical fibers. As a result, POFs were relegated to low-bit-rate and short-distance applications. Recent technological advances and the emergence of a killer application in the automotive industry have propelled POF into the limelight as a lower-cost alternative to glass fiber or copper at medium distances and bit rates of 10 Gb/s. This article reviews the history of POF, the technical developments that have created a buzz about POF, and the applications propelling POF into the mainstream. In addition, the article shows how POF technology exhibits properties similar to \"disruptive technologies\".",

      "abstract": "As the popularity of mobile computing grows, the associated protocols and their scalability are subject to much closer scrutiny. Mobile IP relies heavily on the use of IP-to-IP tunneling, requiring 20 bytes of overhead for every packet routed to or from a mobile node, assuming reverse tunneling is enabled. The goal of this research was to show that enhanced mobile IP (EMIP) eliminated the overhead by replacing tunneling with network address port translation (NAPT) without significantly impacting other performance factors. EMIP was implemented and benchmarks were used to compare EMIP and mobile IP. The percentage of overhead with EMIP approached zero as the number of packets exchanged increased, while the percentage of overhead with mobile IP remained constant. Once three or more round-trip packets were exchanged, the overhead of EMIP was less than mobile IP, and when 1000 round-trip packets were exchanged, EMIP resulted in a bandwidth savings of almost 40,000 bytes. To achieve the bandwidth savings, EMIP introduced a one-time delay in session startup ranging from 160 to 260 ms when compared to mobile IP, but it does not significantly impact the scalability or overall performance of the protocol. Therefore, the decrease in bandwidth consumed by the overhead of EMIP greatly outweighs the one-time delay and additional memory required",

      "abstract": "In hybrid ad hoc networks, mobile nodes can communicate not only with each other in a self-organizing manner, but also with nodes on wired networks for extensive information retrieval and dissemination. In this article we consider efficient routing operations between any two nodes in an ad hoc network that is linked to wired networks by an access point. To build routes with low routing overhead efficiently, we develop a new routing scheme of region-based routing (RBR), which utilizes hop counts between mobile nodes and the access point to localize a route discovery within a limited topological region. Limiting the region of route discovery results in fewer routing messages and therefore reduces routing overhead. Simulation results show that the RBR scheme greatly reduces routing overhead while preserving a high rate of success for route discovery to the destination",

      "abstract": "To upgrade IEEE 802.17 Resilient Packet Ring networks by WDM, most previously reported approaches deploy WDM on the ring, requiring modifications of all nodes at the architecture and/or protocol level without significantly enhancing the performance of RPR apart from increased capacity and optical bypassing capability. In this article we aim at rethinking the box. Leveraging on the dark fiber infrastructure abundantly available in today's metropolitan areas, a subset of RPR nodes are interconnected by a single-hop star WDM subnetwork in a pay-as-you-grow manner. Building on RPR's destination stripping, wrapping, and steering techniques, we describe and examine two novel evolutionary performance-enhancing techniques: proxy stripping and protectoration. Our findings show that the resultant RINGOSTAR network not only dramatically increases spatial reuse, provides fairness as well as fast and efficient resilience against multiple failures but also supports both metro core's uniform and in particular metro edge's strongly hubbed traffic in a highly efficient way",

This article presents a new service platform that can select appropriate services for a wide variety of real-world user activities. The importance of task-awareness for service selection is first emphasized. To obtain task-awareness, a new task model that models comprehensive user activities in the real world is proposed. It enables precise association between user activities and services that assist in performing the activities. This article then presents a new service-selection schema based on the task model. An architecture for building the schema over a network and mobile terminals is discussed, and research on technologies for achieving the architecture is briefly described; these technologies include a tool for populating a task model database, an algorithm for acquiring spatial and temporal contexts to be used as restrictions on service selection, and a push-control mechanism for presenting the results of service selection to users in a context-aware manner. The article concludes with a brief summary and some remarks about potential applications of the proposed platform and its components.",

Reusing the existing mechanisms for user authentication, access control, billing, and roaming handling procedures in mobile territory to construct a complementary network, public WLAN (PWLAN) has drawn the attention of cellular operators such as Vodafone and T-Mobile. In this article we aim to investigate a practical end-to-end PWLAN architecture capable of using GPRS/UMTS SIM-based authentication for current mobile users and carrying out Web-based authentication for occasional users without SIM modules simultaneously. Additionally, we consider a confederation of various PWLAN service providers by a RADIUS-based roaming mechanism to leverage the existing resources of cellular operators. The proposed considerations and guidelines provide a baseline skeleton to build an extendable environment and successfully construct a flexible cellular/PWLAN hotspot in mobeeLAN service.",

      "abstract": "As wireless/mobile technologies evolve, the market for mobile Internet is rapidly growing. To proliferate mobile Internet market, scalable mobility support is a key question. In this article, we propose a scalable application-layer mobility protocol (SAMP) that is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networking and session initiation protocol (SIP). SAMP keeps track of locations of mobile nodes leveraging SIP mobility functions. In SAMP, all SIP servers form a P2P overlay network, which enables scalable, load balanced, and robust mobile Internet. In addition, two optimization techniques, hierarchical registration and two-tier caching schemes, are employed to localize signaling traffic for mobility and to reduce the session setup latency, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that SAMP is an attractive choice for scalable mobile Internet and its limitations such as long handoff and session setup latencies arc substantially mitigated by the optimization techniques",

      "abstract": "Telecom operators and Internet service providers are heading for a new shift in communications paradigms. The forthcoming convergence of cellular and wireless data networks is often manifested in an \"all IP approach\" in which all communications are based on an end-to-end IP protocol framework. The approach to network design becomes user and service-centered, so that continuous reachability of mobile users and sustained communication capabilities are default requirements for a prospective architecture. In this article, we describe a network architecture which is able to provide seamless communication mobility, triggered either by the user or by the network, across multiple technologies. The architecture allows for media independent handovers and supports optimized mobility and resource management functions. The main focus of the article is on major technical highlights of mobility and quality-of-service (QoS) management subsystems for converged networks",

Platform architectures are suggested that are rooted in hardware along with a trusted platform-aware architecture manager that creates closed partitions to provide cryptographic, communications, and manageability services, as well as open partitions for applications processing. Important and desirable ingredients in such platform architectures include domain separation, hardware rooted mechanisms to establish platform trust, hierarchical key management, secure storage, efficient resource management, and an inherently manageable platform.",

In this article we first briefly introduce RFID systems. Then two RFID applications in telemedicine are proposed: studying supply and demand of doctors, nurses, and patients in hospitals and healthcare, and developing mobile telemedicine services. The security and privacy issues of RFID, and their solutions are discussed as well.",

      "abstract": "Past communication and computing trends are inadequate to deal with today's complex, distributed, and diverse network environments. With the recent development of small-size tetherless communication/computing devices and the increasing diversity in their capabilities, autonomic ubiquitous communication environments are emerging. In such environments, the execution of a complex task does not necessarily make use of preconfigured devices or networks, but requires instead the selection of suitable computing elements on-the-fly, based on the task requirements and device characteristics (i.e., networking-on-demand or task-centric networking). Research is currently being carried out in various dimensions in this emerging domain, including, among other approaches for context awareness, service discovery and self-management. In this article we concentrate on proposing a distributed mechanism for discovering suitable service elements on-the-fly.",

      "abstract": "It is now evident to the research community that local computational resources cannot keep up in an economical way with the demands generated by some users/applications. Therefore, distributed computing and the concept of a computational grid are now emerging. Novel transport network concepts are needed to support such visions, and high-speed intelligent optical networking may be the required infrastructure that will enable global grids. Emerging utility grid applications like business continuity and disaster recovery have strong requirements on the dynamic optical networks connecting the distributed grid resources. Supporting grid networking with an intelligent optical network (ION) infrastructure will allow utility grid applications the necessary flexibility with the required QoS (e.g., high bandwidth, reliability, limited delay). Emerging QoS requirements, such as scalable recovery time, highly depend on the ION's signaling architecture. This article gives simple analytical models for the implementation options of optical control plane signaling, shows simulation models for different resilience strategies, and offers some illustrative numerical comparisons to support the aforementioned efforts. This research area is also discussed, among others, in the European research project Multi-Partner European Testbeds for Research Networking (MUPBED).",

      "abstract": "Fourth-generation wireless systems are composed of coexisting and cooperating legacy and new networks. Mobile ad hoc networks are examples of new networks. They have several attractive characteristics and are gaining more and more momentum. Their integration with legacy third-generation networks is now being contemplated. Multimedia conferencing is the basis of a wealth of applications, including video conferences, multiparty games, and distance learning. Signaling is the central nerve of multimedia conferencing. It establishes, modifies, and tears down multimedia conferencing applications. This article is devoted to the signaling aspects of multimedia conferencing in 4G and focuses on the specific case of integrated 3G/MANETs. It reviews the standard 3G architecture and the emerging architectures for MANETs. This review shows that none of them is suitable for integrated 3G/MANETs. We propose a new architecture based on application-level clusters and conference gateways. We have implemented a prototype using the session initiation protocol (SIP) technology.",

      "abstract": "The remarkable advances of practical software-defined radios that use programmable digital devices and radio architectures will enable people with different kinds of equipment running on different frequencies to communicate with one another by proper reconfigurations of their communication devices. In the future fourth-generation mobile communication systems, various access technologies will be integrated into a common platform called the open wireless architecture. SDR technology can be used to implement an OWA system. In a multihop SDR reconfigurable network that follows OWA standards, nodes may be reconfigured while they are working; however, if an error occurs during software dissemination, some nodes may not receive the software correctly, and the network is thus partitioned. Hence, it is very important to ensure that every node in the network can receive the software and update itself correctly. This article proposes a download scheme for real-time software download, application software upgrades, or radio protocol change of wireless nodes in multihop reconfigurable networks. In addition, related enabling hardware techniques are reviewed.",

Unlike the classical SDR paradigm, which digitizes the whole spectrum uniformly, this receiver acts as a signal conditioner for the analog-to-digital converters, emphasizing only the wanted channel. Thus, the ADCs operate with modest resolution and sample rate, consuming low power. This approach makes portable SDR a reality.",

The decentralized and autonomous nature of the various public safety agencies in the United States has led to the deployment of a variety of systems operating in a fragmented spectrum, ranging from lower VHF to upper UHF. Due to the narrowband technologies used in public safety communications systems, public safety agencies have been limited primarily to voice services and low-speed data transfer on their private networks. In contrast, the commercial cellular sector now offers a large portfolio of services that include voice, messaging, email, Web browsing, picture transfer, video streaming, and other wideband services. In this article, some of the factors driving the expansion of spectrum allocated to public safety agencies arc described.",

      "abstract": "Mobile phones and PDAs are converging into mobile lifestyle devices that offer a wide range of applications to end users. Many of these applications will have the ability to adapt themselves to the user's situation, commonly referred to as context awareness. We argue that an infrastructure is needed to enable wide deployment of context-aware applications. A major benefit is interoperability between heterogeneous context sources and applications in a privacy-sensitive way. We identify three main technical challenges to realize such an infrastructure: reasoning to infer higher-level and better quality context information; efficient exchange and distributed processing of context information in dynamic and pervasive environments; and end-user-controlled handling of the privacy aspects. This article explains how we address these challenges with regard to the realization of an infrastructure that supports context-aware mobile applications. We use this infrastructure to support several mobile healthcare applications.",

      "abstract": "Network security polices are essential elements in Internet security devices that provide traffic filtering, integrity, confidentiality, and authentication. Network security perimeter devices such as firewalls, IPSec, and IDS/IPS devices operate based on locally configured policies. However, configuring network security policies remains a complex and error-prone task due to rule dependency semantics and the interaction between policies in the network. This complexity is likely to increase as the network size increases. A successful deployment of a network security system requires global analysis of policy configurations of all network security devices in order to avoid policy conflicts and inconsistency. Policy conflicts may cause serious security breaches and network vulnerability such as blocking legitimate traffic, permitting unwanted traffic, and insecure data transmission. This article presents a comprehensive classification of security policy conflicts that might potentially exist in a single security device (intrapolicy conflicts) or between different network devices (interpolicy conflicts) in enterprise networks. We also show the high probability of creating such conflicts even by expert system administrators and network practitioners.",

The fundamental targets of this evolution - to further reduce user and operator costs and to improve service provisioning - will be met through improved coverage and system capacity as well as increased data rates and reduced latency. This article presents promising technologies to fulfil these targets, including OFDM, multi-antenna solutions, evolved QoS and link layer concepts, and an evolved architecture. Furthermore, the results of a performance evaluation are presented, indicating that the requirements can indeed be reached using the proposed technologies.",

H.264/MPEG4-AVC has recently become the most widely accepted video coding standard since the deployment of MPEG2 at the dawn of digital television, and it may soon overtake MPEG2 in common use. It covers all common video applications ranging from mobile services and videoconferencing to IPTV, HDTV, and HD video storage. This article discusses the technology behind the new H.264/MPEG4-AVC standard, focusing on the main distinct features of its core coding technology and its first set of extensions, known as the fidelity range extensions (FRExt). In addition, this article also discusses the current status of adoption and deployment of the new standard in various application areas",

The users' mobile devices are like another IP host connected to the Internet. In such a scenario, the network operator infrastructure is degraded to bit pipes. To avoid this, the 3G partnership project (3GPP) and ETSI TISPAN have designed IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), a service platform that aims to place the network operator again in the central role of service provisioning. In this article we examine IMS from a mobile operator's perspective and analyse its possible adaptation to the next-generation networks",

UWB technology will provide data rates up to 480 Mb/s within a range of up to 10 m. High-rate UWB will enable fast download of content from one consumer electronic (CE) device to the next in seconds instead of minutes or longer. In addition, the low-power characteristic of UWB will make possible the ubiquitous use of this technology in portable and mobile CE devices, such as cameras, MP3 players, and CD players. The WiMedia Alliance is specifying the physical layer, the MAC sublayer, and convergence layers. The WiMedia PHY layer is based on multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. The WiMedia MAC is completely distributed, making it an excellent candidate not only for the aforementioned UWB applications, but also for the next-generation MAC protocols in the domain of cognitive radios as well as in cooperative communications",

      "abstract": "Emerging large-scale scientific applications have a critical need for high bandwidth and predictable-performance network service. The OptlPuter project is pioneering a radical new type of distributed application paradigm that exploits dedicated optical circuits to tightly couple geographically dispersed resources. These private optical paths are set up on demand and combined with end resources to form a distributed virtual computer (DVC). The DVC provides high-quality dedicated network service to applications. In this article we compare the OptIPuter's approach (DVC), which exploits network resources to deliver higher-quality network services, to several alternative service models (intelligent network and asynchronous file transfer). Our simulations show that there are significant differences among the models in their utilization of resources and delivered application services. Key takeaways include that the OptlPuter approach provides applications with superior network service (as needed by emerging e-science applications and performance-critical distributed applications), at an expense in network resource consumption. The other approaches use fewer network resources, but provide lower-quality application service.",

      "abstract": "In assessing system requirements for effective communication in public safety applications, a number of challenges exist. The Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) mask air-delivery system is essential equipment in certain public service activities, mainly firefighting and HAZ-MAT (hazardous materials) operations. It is important that high-quality and reliable communications are maintained when SCBA equipment is employed. An SCBA mask encloses the face and mouth, which alters articulation and distorts the speech spectrum. SCBA system noises such as alarms and air-regulator noise, in addition to environmental noises, add to the deterioration of speech quality in an SCBA-fronted communication system. A digital speech codec adds another potential source of speech distortion and diminished intelligibility when noise-corrupted speech is processed. This article characterizes some of the effects of SCBA equipment on speech quality and intelligibility in the context of a radio communications system and outlines parameters that should be considered in communications system design and interfacing.",

However, there are advantages and technical issues associated with them. In this article we discuss in detail the features, and the design and implementation challenges of FDD and TDD systems for 4G wireless systems. In particular, we present a number of advantages and flexibilities an TDD system can bring to 4G systems that an FDD system cannot offer, and identify the major challenges, including cross-slot interference, in applying TDD in practice. Due to the fact that cross-slot interference is one of the critical challenges to employing TDD in cellular networks, we also provide a quantitative analysis on its impact on co-channel and adjacent channel interfering cells",

The past few years have brought about a resurgence in PTT as a service offered by commercial providers, driven first by private subscribers and, increasingly, by organizations such as law enforcement agencies that traditionally rely on LMRs. This technology, today one of the growth areas in the communications industry, has received little attention in the scientific literature. In this article, we discuss some of the emerging technologies (voice over IP, CDMA used in 2.5G/3G systems) that relate to today's PTT service. We also discuss the market and financial implications of commercial PTT on current LMR deployments.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic joint optimization of both computational and network resources has the potential of guaranteeing optimal performance Io geographically distributed grid applications. A grid network information and monitoring service (NIMS) has been recently proposed to complement computational resource status information with network resource status information. NIMS information includes, but is not limited to, information already available in the network control plane (e.g., network topology, link capacity occupation, communication delay). This study first reviews some measurement methodologies and network sensors suitable for implementing NIMS components, and then describes some tools currently utilized for monitoring grid network infrastructures. Finally, two implementations of a NIMS component, called the topology discovery service (TDS), are proposed and evaluated. The TDS provides grid users (e.g., applications) or the programming environment middleware with up-to-date information on the grid network infrastructure topology and status. Both proposed implementations can be utilized in any global grid network based on commercial routers without requiring modifications of router management and control protocols.",

      "abstract": "Sensor networks are not just data networks with sensors being the sources of data. Rather, they are often developed and deployed for a specific application, and the entire network operation is accordingly geared toward satisfying this application. For overall system efficiency, it may be necessary for nodes to perform computations on data, as opposed to simply originating or forwarding data. Thus, the entire network can be viewed as performing an application-specific distributed computation. The topic of this article is to survey some lines of research that may be useful in developing a theory of in-network computation, which aims to elucidate how a wireless sensor network should efficiently perform such distributed computation. We review several existing approaches to computation problems in network settings, with a particular emphasis on the communication aspect of computation. We begin by studying the basic two-party communication complexity model and how to optimally compute functions of distributed inputs in this setting. We proceed to larger multihop networks, and study how block computation and function structure can be exploited to provide greater computational throughput. We then consider distributed computation problems in networks subject to noise. Finally, we review some randomized gossip-based approaches to computing aggregate functions in networks. These are diverse approaches spanning many different research communities, but together may find a role in the development of a more substantial theoretical foundation for sensor networks.",

      "abstract": "The recently developed H.264 video standard achieves efficient encoding over a bandwidth ranging from a few kilobits per second to several megabits per second. Hence, transporting H.264 video is expected to be an important component of many wireless multimedia services, such as video conferencing, real-time network gaming, and TV broadcasting. However, due to wireless channel characteristics and lack of QoS support, the basic 802.11-based channel access procedure is merely sufficient to deliver non-real-time traffic. The delivery should be augmented by appropriate mechanisms to better consider different QoS requirements and ultimately adjust the medium access parameters to the video data content characteristics. In this article we address H.264 wireless video transmission over IEEE 802.11 WLAN by proposing a robust cross-layer architecture that leverages the inherent H.264 error resilience tools (i.e., data partitioning); and the existing QoS-based IEEE 802.11e MAC protocol possibilities. The performances of the proposed architecture are extensively investigated by simulations. Results obtained indicate that compared to 802.11 and 802.11e, our cross-layer architecture allows graceful video degradation while minimizing the mean packet loss and end-to-end delays.",

Advance reservation is a promising network service in which network resources are automatically allocated and reserved in advance of the time the resources are actually needed, which allows service providers to more efficiently manage network resources and thus provide better network services. For the next-generation Internet, the underlying transport infrastructure is evolving towards a network that integrates fiber-optic technology and generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) technology. In this article we present a basic framework for automated provisioning of advance reservation service in the next-generation optical Internet, discuss the major issues involved, and explore possible solutions.

      "abstract": "Location-based services turned out not to be the \"next big thing\" following the success stories of GSM and SMS. The reasons for this are manifold and range from inaccurate cellular positioning technologies to a lack of competition in this field, both being closely related to the fact that positioning is controlled by a network-centric approach where the mobile network operator has the unique selling point for making position data available to third parties. However, things change: small, low-cost GPS receivers, either attachable to mobile devices or even integrated, are enjoying great popularity since their recent inception and are expected to become a standard feature of cell phones in the near future. In conjunction with mobile packet data services, they provide a basis for device-centric LBS platforms, where position data can be obtained directly from the mobile device. In this article the device-centric LBS middleware TraX, which focuses particularly on position management, advanced functions for interrelating the position data of several targets, and privacy protection, is presented. Due to its generic and open design, TraX can be reused for a broad range of different LBSs and thus fosters service diversity and multiprovider environments, both of which are essential for making the next generation of LBSs a success",

A simple dynamic configuration should allow the birth of this new brand of networks - networks with a soul. They are closer to end users, turning them into easier to set up. We examine two emerging networking technologies that take network dynamic configuration a step further than what we are used to. These are universal plug and play (UPnP) networks and ambient networks (ANs). Both technologies permit proximity-triggered seamless networking and are the focus of separate working groups. After introducing UPnP, we look in more detail at the design and management aspects of ambient networks. Though not all networks may be designed to be self-composing, we believe the path is set for this course. We show that we have the technology; the way we use it needs to evolve.",

      "abstract": "Service providers today are constantly seeking to offer multiple services on a single common infrastructure. For instance, it is desirable sometimes to provide transport services transparently to data traffic encapsulated over different network layers. Tunneling is a technique for encapsulating a packet or frame within another packet of the same or a different network layer. One of the motivations for tunneling is bridging various heterogeneous networks that use different protocols for communication. Tunneling is also used for providing private and secure communications over a publicly shared network. This article investigates the interactions between different tunneling technologies in order to provide end-to-end virtual connectivity to end clients. Particularly, the article describes the technical details of the implementation of various layer 2 tunneling techniques - such as L2TP, GRE, and MPLS-based tunnels - in order to establish an end-to-end virtual connection service as a concatenation of services offered by the different network domains along the path between end users",

      "abstract": "User interfaces to control networked household appliances are often inadequate. Either they are too simplistic or they are too complex and complicated relying on a PC-based interface. Therefore, a user interface that supports complex functionalities and is easy to use is required. In this article digital pen and paper are presented as a suitable interface. Digital pens are only marginally larger than their traditional counterparts, and digital paper is ordinary paper with an almost invisible unique pattern printed on it. Pen and paper are well known to users and thus an important barrier to the acceptance of networked appliances is removed. The approach is integrated with an open services gateway initiative (OSGi) gateway, thus allowing for flexibility with respect to the protocol used to communicate with the appliance. It is also shown how the approach can be applied to other appliances in and beyond the home",

Long delays in database searches make portable number translation the bottleneck of providing mobile number portability (NP) service. In this article we propose the mitigation of the traffic load through querying an NP database (NPDB) to alleviate the portable number translation delay. We also present a mechanism that utilizes the routing information on dual-mode MSs to alleviate the traffic load of NPDB and thus enhances the efficiency of mobile NP service. To conclude, we evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism by simulation",

By inverse multiplexing, it combines multiple links at a particular layer into aggregate links to achieve a commensurate increase in available bandwidth on the aggregate link. While any inverse multiplexing scheme is about \"more bandwidth\", the VCAT/LCAS is a general technique that can enable a fairly broad range of network features such as (1) right sizing bandwidth for data applications, (2) bandwidth extraction from a mesh network, (3), bandwidth on demand and IP traffic engineering, and (4) provides new forms of protection-restoration and graceful degradation. In this paper, the authors have given a quick overview of VCAT/LCAS technology and just a few examples of its applications",

      "abstract": "This article presents an overview of highway cooperative collision avoidance (CCA), which is an emerging vehicular safety application using the IEEE- and ASTM-adopted Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) standard. Along with a description of the DSRC architecture, we introduce the concept of CCA and its implementation requirements in the context of a vehicle-to-vehicle wireless network, primarily at the Medium Access Control (MAC) and the routing layer. An overview is then provided to establish that the MAC and routing protocols from traditional Mobile Ad Hoc networks arc not directly applicable for CCA and similar safety-critical applications. Specific constraints and future research directions are then identified for packet routing protocols used to support such applications in the DSRC environment. In order to further explain the interactions between CCA and its underlying networking protocols, we present an example of the safety performance of CCA using simulated vehicle crash experiments. The results from these experiments arc also used to demonstrate the need for network data prioritization for safety-critical applications such as CCA. Finally, the performance sensitivity of CCA to unreliable wireless channels is discussed based on the experimental results.",

      "abstract": "In this article we analyze performance of VoIP services over 1xEVDO-Revision A (DO-Rev A) networks and show that high-quality VoIP with unconstrained mobility and high capacity can be achieved. Together with quality of service (QoS) requirements, we emphasize practical issues such as mobility, degradation of feedback-channel quality, and packet overheads. Novel techniques are presented for voice processing such as smart blanking and adaptive dejitter playback buffer with time warping. These techniques help to meet QoS constraints to achieve a circuit-like voice quality while improving overall capacity. Detailed end-to-end simulations are presented and system capacity is analyzed under the QoS and system stability constraints. We claim that DO-Rev A can provide VoIP capacity comparable to circuit-switched cellular CDMA technologies (e.g., IS-2000) and simultaneously carry significant amount of other types of traffic such as non-delay sensitive applications and downlink multicast.",

      "abstract": "IP telephony has been rapidly introduced to replace the traditional circuit switched infrastructure for telephony services. This change has had an enormous impact on critical-infrastructure (CI) sectors, which are expected to become increasingly dependent on IP telephony services. Reliable and secure telephony service is a key concern confronting most organizations in the critical-infrastructure sector today. With the proliferation of voice over IP (VoIP) services in these organizations, it is important for them to understand the security vulnerabilities and come up with a set of best practices during the evolution of the IP telephony services. This article outlines the potential security issues faced by CI sectors as they transform their traditional phone systems into VoIP systems. Vulnerability analyses are conducted to understand the impact of VoIP security challenges in the new convergent network paradigm. The most common security measures are analyzed to identify their strengths and limitations in combating these new security challenges. A set of recommendations and best practices are offered to address the key issues of VoIP security as IP telephony is being introduced into critical infrastructure.",

In this article, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of TDM EPONs and recently reported dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms, including decentralized scheduling schemes. After reviewing previous work on WDM EPONs, we address the requirements of WDM upgraded EPONs and make recommendations on an evolutionary WDM upgrade at the architecture, protocol, and dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm levels, taking backward compatibility with MPCP and future-proofness against arbitrary WDM ONU structures into account. We describe and compare online and offline scheduling paradigms for WDM EPONs. Our simulation results indicate that online scheduling can achieve lower delays, especially at high loads. We outline areas of future research on WDM EPONs.",

The WDM network is controlled through a GMPLS control plane that consists of CR-LDP, LMP, and OSPF-TE. We conducted various field trials on the GMPLS-capable WDM optical network testbed with the main focus on distributed storage service application. We developed and evaluated a distributed storage services application on the WDM optical network testbed and demonstrated that incorporating a lightweight data transport protocol with optical network control could be an efficient approach for data-intensive storage applications by exploiting the dynamic connection establishment and backup protection features.",

      "abstract": "B3G wireless access infrastructures can be realized through the concept of cognitive networks. In a B3G context, a network operator will rely on various alternate wireless access technologies, for realizing the appropriate business goals, such as capacity and QoS levels. Cognitive wireless access networks dynamically change their configuration, and in this respect the radio access technologies and spectrum used at the physical and MAC layers, in order to adapt to environment conditions. A cognitive infrastructure consists of reconfigurable elements and intelligent management functionality. This article focuses on the management part. We present a platform, called m@ANGEL, which adheres to autonomic computing principles, and aims at the provision of seamless cognitive connectivity to the mobile Internet. Our work starts from a business level view of cognitive wireless access networks. Technical requirements for m@ANGEL are identified, and the architecture of the platform is described. Moreover, the article describes the functionality and engineering challenges of the m@ANGEL components, which provide the means for monitoring, discovery, context acquisition, description of profiles/goals/agreements, resource and service brokerage, configuration negotiation, selection, and implementation. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn, and issues for the next phases of our work are identified",
