   "abstract": "The cdma2000/spl reg/ I/spl times/EV-DV system is designed to meet the ever-increasing demand for high-speed packet data transmission while providing the same level of revenue generated by conventional voice communications on existing cdma2000 1/spl times/ systems. It supports concurrent voice and high-speed data on a single cdma 1.25 MHz carrier, and offers improved flexibility for operators to manage data and voice services cost efficiently. However, the Korean market has proved that providing higher bandwidth to the user does not guarantee the success of mobile data service. Users tend not to use expensive mobile wireless data services such as video streaming, video on demand, and MP3 music download service that they feel do not provide enough justification for their costs. The problem LG Telecom faces now as a mobile operator is not only to evolve technologies that enable various services, but also to find a way to provide attractive services at reasonable prices. This article describes experiences in the wireless data market in Korea as well as the market needs and driving forces for cdma2000 1/spl times/EV-DV developments.",

The radio specifications include parameters such as noise figure, nonlinearity, channel filtering, phase noise of local oscillator, dynamic range, and bit resolutions of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. Based on a direct conversion scheme, top-down system-level performance analyses using the radio specifications are realized. Low-power and low-cost circuit topologies are also discussed with chip implementations using 0.18 pm CMOS technology.",

   "abstract": "The spectrum of deployed wireless cellular communication systems is found to be underutilized, even though licensed spectrum is at a premium. To efficiently utilize the bandwidth left unused in a cellular system, the primary system (PRI), we propose an overlaid ad hoc secondary network (ASN) architecture, with the ASN operating over the resources left unutilized by the PRI. Our basic design principle is that the ASN operates in a nonintrusive manner and does not interact with the PRI. In this article we present the ad hoc secondary medium access control (AS-MAC) protocol to enable PRI-SEC interoperation, address a number of technical challenges pertinent to this networking environment, and evaluate the performance of the AS-MAC. In a single-hop ASN the AS-MAC transparently utilizes 75 percent of the bandwidth left unused by the PRI, while in multihop ASNs, due to spatial reuse, the AS-MAC can utilize up to 132 percent of the idle PRI resources in our experiments.",

   "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks consist of small battery powered devices with limited energy resources. Once deployed, the small sensor nodes are usually inaccessible to the user, and thus replacement of the energy source is not feasible. Hence, energy efficiency is a key design issue that needs to be enhanced in order to improve the life span of the network. Several network layer protocols have been proposed to improve the effective lifetime of a network with a limited energy supply. In this article we propose a centralized routing protocol called base-station controlled dynamic clustering protocol (BCDCP), which distributes the energy dissipation evenly among all sensor nodes to improve network lifetime and average energy savings. The performance of BCDCP is then compared to clustering-based schemes such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C), and power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems (PEGASIS). Simulation results show that BCDCP reduces overall energy consumption and improves network lifetime over its comparatives.",

   "abstract": "This article examines contrasting notions of self-organization in the Internet and next-generation communication networks, by reviewing in some detail recent evidence regarding several of the more popular attempts to explain prominent features of Internet structure and behavior as \"emergent phenomena.\" In these examples, what might appear to the nonexpert as \"emergent self-organization\" in the Internet actually results from well conceived (albeit perhaps ad hoc) design, with explanations that are mathematically rigorous, in agreement with engineering reality, and fully consistent with network measurements. These examples serve as concrete starting points from which networking researchers can assess whether or not explanations involving self-organization are relevant or appropriate in the context of next-generation communication networks, while also highlighting the main differences between approaches to self-organization that are rooted in engineering design vs. those inspired by statistical physics.",

   "abstract": "With the fast proliferation of QoS-enabled wireless packet networks, the need for effective QoS control is increasing. In this article, we focus on QoS provisioning in the cdma2000 1/spl times/ evolution for high-speed integrated data and voice (1/spl times/EV-DV) packet core network. We investigate a dynamic bandwidth provisioning method that is able to increase a service provider's revenue. It is achieved by releasing unutilized bandwidth for use by other profitable services. The proposed method is implemented as an SNMP-compliant management information base and deployed at the packet data serving node. The experiments conducted on the LG Telecom 1/spl times/EV-DV testbed show that the method can increase the bandwidth for the conversational class and guarantee adequate service quality for the background class as well.",

   "abstract": "TDD-CDMA, globally recognized as the basis for Chinese 3G, is designed for symmetrical and asymmetrical 3G mobile services. As a time-division duplexing system, TD-SCDMA works in unpaired frequency allocations, supporting the flexible allocation of uplink/downlink slots in one carrier, and adapting to the different system loads between uplink and downlink. Dynamic time slot allocations make it more spectrally efficient than paired uplink/downlink carriers. Consequently, TD-SCDMA can make full use of the radio spectrum through optimal adaptive radio resource allocation. In order to support peak rates of 5 Mb/s or higher, the TD-SCDMA standard is enhanced via high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) mode. In this article the properties and strategies of radio resource management (RRM) are introduced, and the differences in admission control, power control, handover, load control, dynamic channel allocation, and adaptive HSDPA techniques between TDD-CDMA and the conventional FDD-CDMA system are analyzed. Some advanced strategies and architectures for TDD-CDMA RRM algorithms are presented. Since uplink multi-user detection (MUD) and smart antenna (SA) techniques are adopted in TD-SCDMA, the RRM algorithms based on MUD and SA are investigated further. In addition, these advanced RRM algorithms are characterized by an OPNET-based dynamical system-level simulator.",

   "abstract": "Tremendous consumer interest in multimedia applications is fueling the need for successively higher data rates in wireless networks. Data rates in wireless wide area networks are limited by the need to address wide coverage, vehicular mobility, and the limitations of licensed spectrum. Thus, data rates in WWANs continue to lag advances in wireless local area networks by orders of magnitude. There are valuable lessons to be learned from the design of WLANs that provide data rates in excess of hundreds of megabits per second. Several technologies are instrumental in enabling the future of high-performance WWANs, including multiple transmit and receive antennas, OFDM, closed loop transmission control, and low-latency MAC operation. We describe a MIMO WLAN design and prototype that exploits these attributes to provide data rates in excess of 200 Mb/s above the MAC",

Simulation results based on real-world traffic situations indicate that the processing required for handling signaling in multimedia networks depends much more on topology than the bandwidth of the media streams associated with the signaling. Thus, it is compelling to use an architecture that independently scales the signaling and media processing capacity of the interprovider interconnect for multimedia networks.",

   "abstract": "The exponential growth of the Internet, the heterogeneity of networks, and the need for QoS maintenance have urged researchers to develop ideas for managing network scalability and end-to-end QoS assurance. In this article, an IP IntServ architecture in the satellite access network is combined with a scalable IP DiffServ-like architecture in the terrestrial core network. The proposed architecture aims at guaranteeing fine-grained bandwidth control in the satellite access network and stateless scalability in the core network, by exploiting per-aggregate traffic flow control, typical of the aggregate RSVP protocol, and stateless service assurance, typical of the SCORE approach.",

   "abstract": "Network direct attached storage (NDAS) is a network storage architecture that allows direct attachment of existing ATA/ATAPI devices to Ethernet without a separate server. Unlike other architectures such as NAS, SAN, and USB mass storage, no server computer intervenes between the storage and the client hosts. We describe an NDAS disk controller (NDC) amenable to low-cost single-chip implementation that processes a simplified L3/L4 protocol and converts commands between ATA/ATAPI and Ethernet, while the remaining complex tasks are performed by remote hosts. Unlike NAS architectures that use TCP/IP, NDAS uses a TCP-like lean protocol that lends itself well to high-performance hardware realization. Thanks to the simple NDAS architecture and protocol, an NDC implemented on a single 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm chip in 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology achieves a maximum throughput of 55 Mbytes/s on gigabit Ethernet, which is comparable to that of a high-performance disk locally attached to a host computer.",

   "abstract": "In 3G systems, the achievable data rates and capacity on the uplink are much smaller than the downlink data rates and capacity due to the nonorthogonal nature of the CDMA uplink. In this article, we present a new time-orthogonal CDMA approach called high-speed uplink data burst transmission mode. The concept is based on slot-synchronized slot-orthogonal transmissions whereby high-speed data transmissions take place in slots orthogonal to the slots used for physical layer control signaling and low-data-rate transmission such as resource requests. Using this approach, very high data rates and capacity are achieved during data burst transmission because of the availability of high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, resulting from the orthogonal nature of the transmissions. Simulation results show that the uplink spectral efficiency of the proposed scheme is approximately four times better than that achieved with the existing 3G systems",

We first review the multiple access technologies in second- and third-generation wireless cellular systems from historical and technical points of view. This review is followed by a novel formulization of the multiple access schemes through mathematical expressions that could simplify the process of development of new multiple access schemes for B3G wireless cellular systems. We then list the most important features of multiple access schemes in 3G mobile systems. Finally, we conclude the article by reviewing the most promising multiple access technologies for B3G mobile cellular systems.",

   "abstract": "Rapid progress in research and development of wireless networking and communication technologies have created different types of wireless systems (e.g., Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, UMTS, and satellite networks). These systems are envisioned to coordinate with each other to provide ubiquitous high-data-rate services to mobile users. In this article, the architecture for ubiquitous mobile communications (AMC) is introduced that integrates these heterogeneous wireless systems. AMC eliminates the need for direct service level agreements among service providers by using a third party, a network interoperating agent. Instead of deploying a totally new infrastructure, AMC extends the existing infrastructure to integrate heterogeneous wireless systems. It uses IP as the interconnection protocol. By using IP as the gluing protocol, transparency to the heterogeneities of the individual systems is achieved in AMC. Third-party-based authentication and billing algorithms are designed for AMC. New mobility management protocols are also developed to support seamless roaming between different wireless systems.",

   "abstract": "With the proliferation of wireless devices, networks, and systems, the deployment of efficient embedded Java virtual machines is becoming a challenging and important research area. Accordingly, a plethora of acceleration techniques have been proposed. In this article we present a new acceleration technology that we developed for embedded Java virtual machines. Acceleration is achieved by the integration of a new selective dynamic compiler, which we called Armed E-Bunny, into the J2ME/CLDC (Java 2 Micro-Edition for Connected Limited Device Configuration) kilobyte virtual machine (KVM). The modified KVM is ported on a handheld PDA that is powered with embedded Linux. Experimental results demonstrate that we accomplished an important speedup (more than 360 percent) with respect to Sun's latest version of KVM. This experimentation was carried out using standard J2ME benchmarks.",

   "abstract": "The distribution of online music has played a key role in driving the digital multimedia entertainment business to the pervasive extent we know today. The digital music revolution was substantially fueled by the invention of new online distribution models, such as P2P file sharing and online music libraries containing over one million songs in a pay-per-listen fashion. In this context, a new generation of devices that seamlessly integrate multiple radio access technologies is quickly emerging into a market for handheld devices. These devices contributes to the spread of ubiquitous multimedia for everywhere entertainment, and also strongly influence music consumer habits. New music distribution models be implemented to offer the user mobile services based on integrated wired/wireless infrastructures. Novel services allows users to establish or negotiate a music download considering a complex set of access selection criteria, thereby accessing music in the best possible way. The user, moving from a music shower that distributes digital music contents to a 3G wireless entry point, could also decide to nomadically change the download and playout device. An individual who is entering a car while downloading through a cell phone continues the download using the car radio, and finally end the file transfer on a home theatre. In this article we investigate the architectural requirements to effectively support a ubiquitous and nomadic multimedia entertainment service, and propose a music distribution system that offers a seamless and wandering music delivery service. We present experimental results that show the functionalities and performances of our proposed approach in terms of reliability and effectiveness.",

This infrastructure is useful in itself. However, we could get much more from it. We could use it to provide advanced services to the end user. This article presents the experience acquired during the design and implementation of an end-to-end service provisioning platform. We have followed a standards-driven approach to leverage existing middleware with open source assets. The selected middleware-platforms are the OSGi service platform at the residential end, J2EE technologies at the service provider end, and Web services for coarse-grained coordination and interaction between the different actors. In this way we create a suitable environment for all the stakeholders.",

   "abstract": "With the advent of personal video recorders (PVRs), the way people watch TV is rapidly changing. By recording or time-shifting live TV programs into the embedded-disk storage of a PVR, people can watch what they want independent of the broadcasting schedule. Furthermore, peer-to-peer networking technology provides an additional TV content distribution channel to unidirectional broadcasting. However, due to the current limited broadband bandwidth, it is difficult to support high-quality TV content streaming between PVRs on the Internet. In this article we propose novel integrated network/storage architecture to provide the streaming of high-quality broadcast TV contents over fast network connections. To take full advantage of our system resources, we also develop efficient sharing schemes such as matching of a communication pair and channel assignment for extensive time-shifting.",

   "abstract": "Ethernet passive optical networks are a low-cost high-speed solution to the bottleneck problem of the broadband access network. A major characteristic of EPONs is the shared upstream channel among end users, mandating efficient medium access control to facilitate statistical multiplexing and provision multiple services for different types of traffic. This article addresses and provides an overview of the upstream bandwidth allocation issue for multiservice access provisioning over EPONs, and proposes an algorithm for dynamic bandwidth allocation with service differentiation. Based on the multipoint control protocol (MPCP) and bursty traffic prediction, our algorithm enhances QoS metrics such as average frame delay, average queue length, and frame loss probability over other existing protocols.",

   "abstract": "IP-based backbone networks are gradually moving towards a network model consisting of high-speed routers that are flexibly interconnected by lightpaths set up by an optical transport network consisting of WDM links and optical cross-connects. Recovery mechanisms at both network layers are crucial to reach the high availability requirements of critical services. In such a model, the GMPLS protocol suite can provide a distributed control plane that can be used to deliver rapid and dynamic circuit provisioning of end-to-end optical lightpaths. This article explains that it can be very beneficial to exploit this functionality to enhance the cost effectiveness of multilayer recovery significantly. Several practical case studies illustrate this concept and highlight the opportunities and challenges to be faced.",

   "abstract": "Multistage buffered switching fabrics are the most efficient method for scaling packet switches to very large numbers of ports. The Benes network is the lowest-cost switching fabric known to yield operation free of internal blocking. Backpressure inside a switching fabric can limit the use of expensive off-chip buffer memory to just virtual-output queues in front of the input stage. This article extends the known credit-based flow control (backpressure) architectures to the Benes network. To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element, and for which we have proved freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we verify operation free of internal blocking, evaluate various cell distribution and resequencing methods, compare performance to that of ideal output queuing, the iSLIP crossbar scheduling algorithm, and adaptive and randomized routing, and show that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports.",

   "abstract": "Service providers, especially in the mobile entertainment domain, are facing increasing competition. The ability to design, develop, and deploy unique context-aware entertainment services fast and easily as well as the capability to provide intuitive user interfaces becomes essential for market players. Furthermore, today's mobile world is made up of heterogeneous networks accessible via various devices with different characteristics. Progressive users have the desire to utilize the same services and access the same information content on all available devices. At the same time, service providers have to diversify their services in order to remain competitive and attract the various customer segments making up the mass market. We introduce an agent-based serviceware framework to assist service providers in developing innovative services, thus reducing the time to market of the respective applications. The realized serviceware framework offers personalization, location awareness, and the multi-access service platform, a flexible solution for ubiquitous service access. Thus, our solution allows a heterogeneous landscape of end devices to access an application server's mobile services in a multimodal, multilingual, and multimedia-based manner. We describe the utilization of the different modules of the service framework as well as the BerlinTainment application, an entertainment planning system based on the framework.",

   "abstract": "The digital music revolution has improved the availability of music and made it easier to enjoy. The shift from hard support, such as audio CDs, to software leaves some unsatisfied by the loss of additional media contents, such as images, lyrics, and CD cover. We propose to fill the gap by enriching e-music with multimedia contents. Our proposal focuses specifically on MP3 as a widely distributed open format. The challenge we meet in enriching MP3 lies in maintaining audio compatibility and avoiding file size explosion. To this end, we define a description language to express multimedia contents in a textual way, with higher representation efficiency than existing languages. We also address security issues that arise from the use of an open format. Effectiveness is shown with an MP3 player capable of rendering multimedia contents.",

   "abstract": "The widespread availability and adoption of high-speed broadband Internet access by consumers is increasingly viewed in all developed nations not only as a key driver of information and communication technology (ICT) capabilities, but also of the overall prosperity and well being of the economy of a developed nation. Developed nations are seeking to promote rapid deployment of broadband, coupled with rapid adoption by consumers. Some countries, notably the United States, have sought to rely on competition among multiple broadband media to achieve broadband deployment. Since cable deployments tend to be limited in most European countries, the European approach has been heavily dependent on procompetitive regulation in order to achieve intramodal competition. In this paper, the author discussed the broadband adoption in Europe. It details the upsurge in broadband technology as well as the regulatory and policy issues.",

   "abstract": "The IEEE 802.16 family of standards and its associated industry consortium, WiMax, promise to deliver high data rates over large areas to a large number of users in the near future. This exciting addition to current broadband options such as DSL, cable, and WiFi promises to rapidly provide broadband access to locations in the world's rural and developing areas where broadband is currently unavailable, as well as competing for urban market share. WiMax's competitiveness in the marketplace largely depends on the actual data rates and ranges that are achieved, but this has been difficult to judge due to the large number of possible options and competing marketing claims. This article first provides a tutorial overview of 802.16. Then, based on extensive recent studies, this article presents the realistic attainable throughput and performance of expected WiMax compatible systems based on the 802.16d standard approved in June 2004 (now named 802.16-2004). We also suggest future enhancements to the standard that could at least quadruple the achievable data rate, while also increasing the robustness and coverage, with only moderate complexity increases.",

   "abstract": "We propose a circuit-switched high-speed end-to-end transport architecture (CHEETAH) as a networking solution to provide high-speed end-to-end circuit connectivity to end hosts on a dynamic call-by-call basis. Not only is it envisioned as a complementary service to the basic connectionless service provided by today's Internet; it also relies on and leverages the presence of this service. Noting the dominance of Ethernet in LANs and SONET/SDH in WANs, CHEETAH circuits consists of Ethernet segments at the ends and Ethernet-over-SONET segments in the wide area. In this article we explain the CHEETAH concept and describe a wide-area experimental network testbed we have deployed based on this concept. The network testbed currently extends between Raleigh, North Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and uses off-the-shelf switches. We have created CHEETAH software to run on end hosts to enable automated use of this network by applications. Our first users of this network testbed and software is the terascale supernova initiative (TSI) project researchers, who plan to use this network for large file transfers and remote visualizations.",

We refer to the target (client) devices as personal portable devices (PPDs). The architecture of the CONNECT system is described, with emphasis on the accessibility services provided to its clients. As an example, the reminder service of CONNECT is profiled where care providers and community organizers (or general users who have appropriate rights) can send timely reminders to the PPD owners, giving them a chance to respond to these messages. In conjunction with the connect project, 600 PPDs are deployed to people with disabilities for evaluation purposes.",

Code spreading uses a set of smart codes with its meritorious properties, which can eliminate multipath and multiuser interferences. The same number of smart codes applied repeatedly in each subcarrier of OFDMA is used to increase the number of traffic channels. It takes advantage of attributes of both CDMA and OFDMA toward a simpler and more spectrally efficient system applied in a CDD system [(W.C.Y. Lee, Mar 2002), (W.C.Y. Lee, 2003)]",

   "abstract": "Broadband access and multimedia technologies are expected to be primary drivers for the telecommunications market of the next few years. The increasing bandwidth needs, together with the plethora of different services and heterogeneous traffic flows, requires accurate methodologies for resource dimensioning, especially in the field of wireless technologies where efficient bandwidth usage is crucial. New methodologies need to be based on up-to-date traffic source modeling and usage scenarios. Therefore, in this article, we propose a survey of statistical characterization of single traffic sources, QoS requirements and different traffic demands. When possible, we consider the aggregate traffic resulting from a large number of heavy tailed ON/OFF sources, relying on the theory of long-range dependent flows. This method is particularly useful when time- and resource-consuming simulations are needed in order to dimension the system resources, which is always the case in the multimedia scenarios of future networks. We use such a traffic framework to estimate by simulations the capacity of an LMDS system.",

   "abstract": "A testbed is described that allows both physical layer errors to be observed and analyzed, as well as monitoring network performance via frame loss. Real network traffic loads can be used for testing so that all measurements taken are representative of what would be seen in a deployed system. We illustrate our testbed with an examination of the behavior of a well-known networking standard, Gigabit Ethernet, in conditions of reduced receiver power on optical fiber. Our testbed results show that the line codes used to represent the data in the network affect the bit error rate for that data. Along with the previously reported result that bit error rate and packet error rate have only a weakly deterministic relationship, this highlights the need for testing of all network layers within a complete system carrying real-world traffic.",

   "abstract": "When compared with now classical MANETs, sensor networks have different characteristics, and present different design and engineering challenges. One of the main aspects of sensor networks is that the solutions tend to be very application-specific. For this reason, a layered view like the one used in OSI imposes a large penalty, and implementations more geared toward the particular are desirable. This survey presents the three main paradigms for communication in ad hoc networks and discusses their applicability for routing, querying, and discovery. We conclude that the node-centric approach, although the oldest and best understood, is not the most appropriate for large-size low-energy application-specific sensor networks.",

This method utilizes the complement bits that are added to the original information bits, which can effectively reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals with random frame size N and the coding rate R /spl les/ (N - k)/N, where k is a positive integer and k /spl les/ N/2. The performance results obtained with CBC are given and compared with that of some well known schemes, such as simple block coding, modified simple block coding, simple odd parity code, and cyclic coding, for the same purpose. The results show that at the same coding rate 3/4, CBC can achieve almost the same performance as SBC and MSBC, but with lower complexity, and the same performance can be obtained with a higher coding rate using CBC. The PAPR reductions of CBC with coding rate (N - 1)/N are almost the same as with a coding rate less than (N - 1)/N, but almost the twice as these of SOPC when N /spl ges/ 16. Moreover, we can find that PAPR is the lowest for all block codes using CBC with coding rate 3/4. So modified CBC (MCBC) is also proposed and analyzed, combined with the subblock processing technique to make CBC effective for OFDM systems with large frame sizes. The flexibility in coding rate choice and low complexity make the proposed CBC more suitable for random frame size with high coding rate and can also provide error detection.",

   "abstract": "Traffic engineering enhances an ISP's capability to manage and utilize its resources effectively. MPLS has emerged as an efficient packet forwarding tool that gives a significant boost to the traffic engineering capabilities of an ISP. A fundamental problem in MPLS is to reduce label space usage by label switched paths while meeting the requirements of the flows traversing the network. Using multipoint-to-point LSP trees has been proposed as one of the techniques to reduce label space usage. We look at the problem of creating multipoint-to-point LSPs given a set of precomputed point-to-point LSPs. We propose a heuristic for multipoint-to-point LSP creation and show its effectiveness.",

   "abstract": "Cross-layer design approaches are critical for efficient utilization of the scarce radio resources with QoS provisioning in the third-generation wireless networks and beyond. Better system performance can be obtained from information exchanges across protocol layers, which may not be available in the traditional layering architecture. This article provides an overview of cross-layer design approaches for resource allocation in 3G CDMA networks, summarizes state-of-the-art research results, and suggests further research issues. In addition, a cross-layer design approach for real-time video over time-varying CDMA channels is proposed, where link layer resource allocation benefits from information in both the application and physical layers. Simulations results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

   "abstract": "Of late, there has been an avalanche of cross-layer design proposals for wireless networks. A number of researchers have looked at specific aspects of network performance and, approaching cross-layer design via their interpretation of what it implies, have presented several cross-layer design proposals. These proposals involve different layers of the protocol stack, and address both cellular and ad hoc networks. There has also been work relating to the implementation of cross-layer interactions. It is high time that these various individual efforts be put into perspective and a more holistic view be taken. In this article, we take a step in that direction by presenting a survey of the literature in the area of cross-layer design, and by taking stock of the ongoing work. We suggest a definition for cross-layer design, discuss the basic types of cross-layer design with examples drawn from the literature, and categorize the initial proposals on how cross-layer interactions may be implemented. We then highlight some open challenges and new opportunities for cross-layer design. Designers presenting cross-layer design proposals can start addressing these as they move ahead.",

In particular, the information obtained from the fast power control algorithm is used to properly schedule transmissions. A prioritization function that exploits the short-term channel variations is proposed. This strategy is shown to be a feasible approach to improve system performance in terms of capacity and delay. This enhancement is obtained as a benefit of intrinsic multi-user diversity. The proposal is applicable within the current UMTS radio resource management framework.",

   "abstract": "One of the most important resources in wireless sensor networks is energy, since, in general, batteries cannot be recharged. The information about the amount of energy available at each part of the network is called the energy map and can be explored by data dissemination algorithms. In this work, a new data dissemination algorithm for wireless sensor networks is proposed. The key idea is to combine concepts presented in trajectory-based forwarding with the information provided by the energy map to determine routes in a dynamic fashion. Simulation results reveal that the energy spent with data dissemination activity can be concentrated on nodes with high energy reserves, whereas low-energy nodes can use their energy only to perform sensing activity. In this manner, partitions of the network due to nodes that run out of energy can be significantly delayed and the network lifetime extended.",

In addition, we provide a simulation framework for cross-layer analysis between the MAC and PHY layers in 802.16e systems. Through this cross-layer simulator, we show that average cell throughput can be improved by 25-60 percent by applying careful cross-layer adaptation schemes.",

   "abstract": "Optical burst switching has been receiving increased attention as a promising technology for building the next-generation optical Internet. This article presents the design and discusses the implementation of an overlay mode optical burst-switched network testbed. A flexible \"transceiver + forwarding\" edge node architecture is proposed to perform both electronic burst assembly/disassembly and optical burst forwarding. It is designed to provide class of service and wavelength selection for locally generated bursts, and transparency to cut-through bursts. The functional modules of the control plane and related key design issues are presented. In particular, we discuss a scheduling mechanism that efficiently combines two different contention resolutions in space and wavelength domains. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this scheme in reducing burst blocking probability. Furthermore, the performance of the network testbed and corresponding methods of improving it are discussed.",

Recognizing the growing importance of testbeds, this article is one of the first attempts to identify a comprehensive set of requirements for a general-purpose multihop wireless network testbed and the challenges therein. The issues range from initial testbed deployment and routine management to individual experimental configuration and data collection. We survey state-of-the-art wireless testbeds and highlight their salient features.

   "abstract": "We present guidelines on how to design network layer protocols when the unit disk graph (UDG) model is replaced by a more realistic physical layer model. Instead of merely using the transmission radius in the UDG model, physical, MAC, and network layers share the information about a bit and/or packet reception probability as a function of distance between nodes. We assume that all nodes use the same transmission power for sending messages, and that a packet is received when all its bits are correctly received. The MAC layer reacts to this probabilistic reception information by adjusting the number of acknowledgments and/or retransmissions. We observe that an optimal route discovery protocol cannot be based on a single retransmission by each node, because such a search may fail to reach the destination or find the optimal path. Next, we discuss that gaining neighbor knowledge information with \"hello\" packets is not a trivial protocol. We describe localized position-based routing protocols that aim to minimize the expected hop count (in case of hop-by-hop acknowledgments and fixed bit rate) or maximize the probability of delivery (when acknowledgments are not sent). We propose a guideline for the design of greedy position-based routing protocols with known destination locations. The node currently holding the message forwards it to a neighbor (closer to the destination than itself) that minimizes the ratio of cost over progress, where the cost measure depends on the assumptions and metrics used, while the progress measures the difference in distances to the destination. We consider two basic medium access layer approaches, with fixed and variable packet lengths. This article serves as a preliminary contribution toward the development of network layer protocols that match the assumptions and criteria already used in simulators and ultimately in real equipment.",

All-digital phase locked loop and direct RF sampling techniques allow great flexibility in reconfigurable radio design. Digital signal processing concepts are used to help relieve analog design complexity, allowing one to reduce cost and power consumption in a reconfigurable design environment.

   "abstract": "MPLS is currently used by several JSPs to carry some high-value traffic components, such as telephony over IP trunks and VPNs. For this type of traffic, service availability is a critical QoS dimension that needs to be protected from network failures. With MPLS-TE, this can be achieved by means of path protection schemes, where active and backup LSPs are routed along diverse paths. Besides protection, path diversity can be exploited for load balancing, another common means of QoS improvement. In order to preserve other QoS requirements, the paths must meet certain constraints (e.g., bandwidth availability, low load) and/or minimize some metric (e.g., hop count). This requires the ability to establish path diversity in an optimal way. In many cases of practical interest, the QoS traffic has an interdomain scope. This is the case for ToIP and VPN traffic between different carriers, or between different ASs owned by the same carrier, as found, for example, after corporate acquisitions or mergers. Therefore, path diversity is a requirement for interdomain traffic engineering. In this work we address path diversity in a multidomain network, where individual domains are capable of connection-oriented forwarding and endowed with an MPLS-TE control plane. For administrative and/or scalability reasons intradomain routing information is not disseminated externally, so dynamic path computation must be achieved by a distributed scheme based on interdomain collaboration. We briefly describe three alternative schemes recently proposed for interdomain diverse path computation, and quantitatively assess their performance with simulations over real ISP topologies.",

   "abstract": "This article presents two dynamic multilayer routing policies implemented in the photonic MPLS router developed by NTT for IP+optical generalized MPLS networks. According to IP traffic requests, wavelength paths called lambda label switched paths are set up and released in a distributed manner based on GMPLS routing and signaling protocols. Both dynamic routing policies first try to allocate a newly requested electrical path to an existing optical path that directly connects the source and destination nodes. If such a path is not available, the two policies employ different procedures. Policy 1 tries to find available existing optical paths with two or more hops that connect the source and destination nodes. Policy 2 tries to establish a new one-hop optical path between source and destination nodes. The performances of the two routing policies are evaluated. Simulation results suggest that policy 2 outperforms policy 1 if p is large, where p is the number of packet-switching-capable ports; the reverse is true only if p is small. We observe that p is the key factor in choosing the most appropriate routing policy. We also describe items that need to be standardized in the IETF to effectively achieve multilayer traffic engineering.",

   "abstract": "Ethernet has grown from its roots in LANs to contend in previously unchartered territory of MANs and WANs. A slew of projects underway in the IEEE 802 standards bodies plan to groom Ethernet with carrier grade features like high availability, fault management, and resiliency thus far found only in other circuit-switched technologies. These include, among others, IEEE 802.1ag (connectivity fault management), IEEE 802.1ad (provider bridges), and IEEE 802.1ah (provider backbone bridges). IEEE 802.1ah addresses the service and MAC address scalability of provider backbone bridges. Since Ethernet has been architected and designed for a shared medium, it inherently handles broadcast and multicast traffic very efficiently, unlike layer 3 technologies, where multicasting and broadcasting rely on using multiple point-to-point connections. With IEEE 802.1ah, Ethernet would be able to provide millions of service instances in a provider backbone network. While flooding of frames in a LAN may provide for good multicasting, flooding of data in a MAN or WAN could mean huge bandwidth wastages, especially when the remote peers are geographically distant, and the traffic is not necessarily destined to any of its local ports of the peers. In this article we explore technologies to Address efficient multicasting in provider backbone networks. We also consider extending this technology to address unknown unicast floods and efficient proxy of customer multicast frames.",

   "abstract": "The all-IP DiffServ model is expected to be the most promising architecture for QoS provisioning in China's next-generation wireless networks, due to its scalability, convenience for mobility support, and capability of interworking heterogeneous radio access networks. This article focuses on efficient resource allocation in a wireless DiffServ architecture. Resource utilization efficiency is particularly important for China's wireless networks as the mobile user density in China is and will continue to be much higher than that in other countries. More specifically, we propose a novel buffer sharing scheme to provide assured service for real-time layer-coded multimedia traffic, which can guarantee the specific packet loss requirement of each layer with UDP as the transport layer protocol. An adaptive optimal buffer configuration can be applied to achieve maximum resource utilization over the time-varying channel. Assured service is also provided to TCP data traffic for guaranteed throughput, where the cross-layer coupling between the TCP layer and link layer is exploited to efficiently utilize the wireless resources.",

   "abstract": "Bluetooth is a promising short-range wireless communication technology with the characteristics of interference resilience and power efficiency, both desirable for wireless sensor networks. The new Intel Mote sensor devices have Bluetooth technology incorporated as the standard wireless communications interface. When using Bluetooth in applications where multihop routing is required, groups of Bluetooth piconets combine together to form a scatternet. However, most of the existing scatternet formation protocols are designed to facilitate communications between any two pairs of devices, regardless of the actual traffic demand pattern. For wireless sensor network applications with low-duty-cycle traffic patterns, an on-demand scatternet formation protocol can achieve significant power saving by avoiding unnecessary network connectivity. To that end, we introduce an on-demand scatternet and route formation protocol designed specifically for Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks. Our protocol builds a scatternet on demand, and is able to cope with multiple sources initiating traffic simultaneously. In addition, our energy-aware forwarding nodes selection scheme is based on local information only, and results in more uniform network resource utilization and improved network lifetime. Simulation results show that our protocol can provide scatternet formation with reasonable delay and good load balance, which results in prolonged network lifetime for Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks.",

   "abstract": "The onset of Ethernet as a metropolitan and wide area networking, technology has driven the need for a new set of operations, administration, and maintenance protocols. Service provider networks are large and complex with a wide user base, and they often involve different operators that must work together in order to provide end-to-end services to enterprise customers. With enterprise end customer demands ever increasing, so have the requirements on service provider Ethernet networks increased, particularly in the areas of availability and mean time to repair. Ethernet OAM addresses these areas and more, and is a tool that translates directly to the competitiveness of the service provider. Ethernet OAM is a broad topic, but this article focuses on three main areas that are most in need by service providers and are rapidly evolving in the standards bodies: Service OAM, Link OAM and Ethernet LMI. These OAM protocols have unique objectives but are complementary to each other. Service OAM provides monitoring and troubleshooting of end-to-end Ethernet service instances, while link OAM allows a provider to monitor and troubleshoot an individual Ethernet link. There are of course many different ways to provide this type of functionality, but fortunately standards bodies such as ITU Study Group 13, IEEE 802.3 Clause 57 (formerly 802.3ah), IEEE 802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management, and the Metro Ethernet Forum are all driving toward consistent recommendations and standards for Ethernet OAM.",

It is viewed as a key element in providing a universal roaming solution across different wireless access technologies. However, mobile IP in its basic form inherits the IP incapability to provide QoS guarantees. This results in mobile IP's lack of support for seamless intradomain mobility. This article surveys extensions that have been proposed to enhance the QoS functionality of mobile IP. It gives a brief overview of mobile IP and Internet QoS paradigms, and describes their general shortcomings with regard to QoS and mobility, respectively.

   "abstract": "The fiber optic cable infrastructure currently used by many large data centers is over 10 years old, and may soon require upgrading in order to support higher-data-rate services. Legacy multimode optical fiber is typically low bandwidth, and will only support limited distances at data rates exceeding 1 Gb/s. In this article we investigate various methods for extending the distance of multimode fiber at higher data rates. This includes the tactical use of enhanced bandwidth multimode fiber, electronic dispersion compensation, and wavelength tuning control loops.",

With FGS coding, the video stream can be flexibly truncated at very fine granularity to adapt to the available network resources. In this article, we introduce the communications generalist to the basic properties of FGS video coding to provide background for the design of video streaming mechanisms for FGS video. We then outline a methodology for evaluating streaming mechanisms for FGS encoded video. The methodology relies on traces of the rate-distortion characteristics of FGS encoded video and enables networking researchers and practitioners without access to video codecs and video sequences to develop and evaluate rate distortion optimized streaming mechanisms for FGS encoded video.",

   "abstract": "This article examines the technical challenges involved in the delivery of GMPLS, and in particular the challenges in managing these networks. This article focuses first on requirements gathered from customers who are deploying GMPLS in their networks, or will be doing so in the near future. The motivations for these requirements are often based on a service provider's next-generation network designs that are motivated primarily by network convergence, and the promised operational and capital expense reductions and architectural simplifications over existing segregated network designs. This article then considers various solution options to manage GMPLS networks based on these requirements. The key areas examined include provisioning/configuration, performance monitoring and operations and management, and tools that can be used for these purposes. We conclude with a recap of standardization issues and opportunities.",

   "abstract": "Carriers are enhancing their transport networks and improving their daily operations to address the increasing demand for (new) IP-based services. They require more scalable support for the increasing traffic demand and more flexible operations for connection provisioning. They are also seeking optimized resource utilization and time performance using faster and more robust recovery schemes while maintaining overall network costs. With advances in the GMPLS protocol suite including its user-network interface support, the possibility for better cooperation between transport and IP/MPLS networks is now possible. This article addresses this question by positioning and comparing the capabilities of the optical interworking forum's UNI with the Internet engineering task force's GMPLS UNI. Through three recovery scenarios, a quantitative analysis is provided that determines the gain obtained in deploying the GMPLS UNI over its OIF counterpart. Finally, a testbed demonstrating the feasibility and practicability of the GMPLS UNI implementation (which enables end-to-end connection rerouting) is presented.",

   "abstract": "This article reports on the continuous activities of Deutsche Telekom in setting up comprehensive ASON/GMPLS network demonstrators. The goal is to enable practical evaluations and early experiences with prototype implementations related to new standards and specifications from ITU-T, IETF, and OIF. Evolving from the GSN Demonstrator toward the current GSN+ Demonstrator configuration, this field testbed comprises ASON/GMPLS-based backbone network domains, as well as key client networks such as IP, Ethernet (metro and access networks), storage area networks, and broadband video applications to exemplify the wide range of network functions enabled by these new technologies. These ASON/GMPLS demonstrator activities were embedded in the OIF World Interoperability Tests and Demonstration in 2004, and are linked with the German national (VIOLA) and pan-European (MUPBED) project activities ensuring the highest level of interoperable implementations.",

In this work a heterogeneous mobile ad hoc network is defined as a network of mobile nodes that are characterized by different communications capabilities, such as multiple radio interfaces. The article focuses on proposing the HOLSR protocol. The HOLSR mechanism is derived from the OLSR protocol; however, unlike OLSR, the HOLSR protocol takes advantage of different mobile node capabilities to reduce the routing control overhead in large heterogeneous ad hoc networks, thus improving the performance of the routing mechanism.",

   "abstract": "VLSI realization of video compression is the key to many real-time multimedia communications systems. Among the video compression algorithms, the newly established MPEG-4 and, in particular, H.264 standards have become increasingly popular. However, the high coding efficiency of such video coding algorithms comes at the cost of a dramatic increase in complexity. Effective and efficient hardware solutions to this problem are necessary. In this article we present an overview of the hardware design issues of MPEG-4 and H.264. Both module and system architectures of these two coding standards are discussed. Based on these architectures, the design of a single-chip encoder complying with the H.264 baseline profile and capable of encoding the D1 resolution (720 x 480) video at 30 Hz is presented as an example. In addition, the system integration issues of video compression engines with multimedia communication systems and a general hardware platform for various applications are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Network survivability is gaining increasing attention from the Internet research community. The ubiquity of IP services has fueled increasing interest in ensuring their dependability, by making IP networks more disruption-tolerant. After providing a brief overview of how routing is accomplished in the Internet, this article reviews how the protocols react to failures or changes in network state within an autonomous system. The problems associated with current restoration schemes, with respect to newer and more stringent requirements posed by emerging services such as voice over IP, are identified. We present an overview of the schemes proposed to ameliorate fault recovery and critique their contributions. We also outline future research directions for improving IP resilience.",

   "abstract": "In recent days, there has been considerable interest in deploying IPv6-based services. Trial and commercial IPv6 services offering has already begun, especially in Japan, Korea, China, and other parts of the world. At the same time, many service providers have embraced MPLS as the enabler for the required multiservice capabilities of their next-generation packet networks. Also, the widespread deployment of DWDM-based optical transport systems in the core network to satisfy the tremendous need and increase in capacity demand has led network planners to reconsider traditional approaches to provisioning and network restoration, and plan integration of the optical layer into the MPLS infrastructure according to the emerging GMPLS technology. The purpose of this article is to discuss next-generation network architecture evolution and present a detailed architecture for transport of emerging IPv6 services and applications over next-generation GMPLS multiservice backbone networks. This article also presents an implementation and demonstration of this technique for IPv6 transport over a GMPLS backbone network as well as interoperability verification of IPv6 and GMPLS using a GMPLS network testbed.",

However, detailed analysis and quantitative evaluation of the changes induced by such technologies is very rare. In this article we quantify the cost reduction potential of GMPLS. We present a detailed analysis and modeling of traditional operator processes. We also develop a model for the expected changed processes when using GMPLS and identify the differences quantitatively. A survey with major telecom operators has been done, and the process models have been verified and parameterized. This allowed quantitative evaluations of the OPEX changes with GMPLS. The results show that, depending on the network operator's processes, different impacts can be expected. As an overall result we could verify that a reduction on the order of 50 percent of OPEX can be expected for most operational models.",

Service providers were to be similarly affected by the increase in revenues paid by the users of these new services. Equipment vendors would have a difficult time keeping inventories of the NGN infrastructure. The truth has been somewhat different. In this article we characterize a set of inhibitors - technical, regulatory, and business-related - that are affecting the ubiquitous deployment of NGN services.",

   "abstract": "Thus far, high-altitude platform (HAP)-based systems have been mainly conceived as an alternative to satellites for complementing the terrestrial network. This article aims to show that HAP should no longer be seen as a competitor technology by investors of satellites, but as a key element for an efficient hybrid terrestrial-satellite communication system. Two integrated HAP-satellite scenarios are presented, in which the HAP is used to overcome some of the shortcomings of satellite-based communications. Moreover, it is shown that the integration of HAPs with satellite systems can be used to provide more efficient fleet-management and traffic-control services and more powerful data-relay systems.",

   "abstract": "As multivendor, multitechnology networks are deployed in a carrier's network, a network operator must integrate these networks to have a unified control platform to lower operational costs and deliver customer-specified QoS. An intelligent network control middleware framework for multivendor networks is described in this article. The architectural framework is designed to control and manage next generation network elements as well as legacy telecom networks. The layers within the framework include mediation, control plane, network resource management, and application programmable interfaces. An independent, distributed control plane aims at service interoperability and network scalability. An experimental study on circuit provisioning using the proposed middleware framework is conducted on Sun Lab servers. The middleware performance results are reported. Experimentation architecture and metrics can be extended to a performance benchmark upon which the control plane products can be evaluated.",

   "abstract": "The promise of broadband power line (BPL) communications - broadband access to virtually every home in the United States - remains unfulfilled if the radio emissions from these systems cause significant harmful interference to other users of the wireless spectrum. This article presents an elementary analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying these emissions, from which the interference characteristics of BPL systems can be derived. Numerical models are evaluated for idealized systems using overhead medium-voltage wires, a configuration that is of particular interest for U.S. deployments. The central conclusions of the analysis are: (i) BPL interference is governed primarily by two parameters: signal power and electrical balance of system excitation; (ii) interfering emissions are typically confined to the immediate vicinity of the BPL wire, but long-range effects cannot be neglected; and (iii) measurements on an installed BPL system suggest that it is operating within, but very close to, the limits set by rules recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.",

   "abstract": "The choice of the direct sequence spreading code in DS-CDMA predetermines the properties of the system. This contribution demonstrates that the family of codes exhibiting an interference-free window (IFW) outperforms classic spreading codes, provided that the interfering multi-user and multipath components arrive within this IFW, which may be ensured with the aid of quasi-synchronous adaptive timing advance control. It is demonstrated that the IFW duration may be extended with the advent of multicarrier DS-CDMA proportionately to the number of subcarriers. Hence, the resultant MC DS-CDMA system is capable of exhibiting near-single-user performance without employing a multi-user detector. A limitation of the system is that the number of spreading codes exhibiting a certain IFW is limited, although this problem may be mitigated with the aid of novel code design principles",

As a special form of CDMA, the new scheme inherits many advantages of CDMA, such as dynamic channel sharing, mitigation of cross-cell interference, asynchronous transmission, ease of cell planning, and robustness against fading. Furthermore, it allows a low-cost interference cancellation technique applicable to systems with large numbers of users in multipath channels. Performance close to theoretical limits has been observed based on an unequal power control strategy.",

In addition to introducing the main challenges and design options that need to be considered, we perform a simulation-based evaluation aiming at providing some insight on the performance of these approaches.

   "abstract": "With the worldwide success of IP-MPLS [E. Rosen et al., Jan. 2001] networks deployment, inter-connecting multiple provider IP-MPLS networks for global reachability becomes the next important step. Many providers have implemented MPLS interprovider connections. In this article we first briefly describe the drivers behind the need of interprovider IP-MPLS services, such as layer 3 VPNs [E. Rosen and Y. Rekhter, Oct 2004], pseudowire emulation for transporting layer 2 traffic over IP-MPLS, VoIP, and others. We then discuss the general requirements for the interconnections, from end users' and service providers' perspectives, including security, scalability, manageability, QoS, and end-to-end SLAs. We then address the deployment options and challenges faced by service providers. Specifically, we discuss the following areas of interprovider service implementation: protocol implementation options for L3 VPN and their trade-offs, methods for guaranteeing consistent QoS across providers' boundaries, interprovider traffic engineering approaches, and operation challenges: from business to processes, from troubleshooting/monitoring to SLAs. By identifying the issues and challenges, our ultimate goal is to move toward the development of much needed common practices and procedures to assist in the establishment of interprovider IP-MPLS services.",

   "abstract": "This article evaluates network and server infrastructure requirements to support real-time flows associated with networked entertainment applications. These include the state information flow to update the status of the virtual environment and immersive communication flows such as voice, video, gesture, and haptics communication. The article demonstrates that scaling these applications to large geographical spreads of participants requires distribution of computation to meet the latency constraints of the applications. This latency-driven distribution of computation is essential even when there are no limitations on the availability of computational resources in one location. The article provides detailed results on distributed server architectures for two of these real-time flows, state information and immersive voice communication. It also identifies a generic set of requirements for the underlying network and server infrastructure to support these applications and propose a new design, called switched overlay networks, for this purpose.",

We develop light-trails as a novel and amenable control and management solution to address IP-centric communication problems at the optical layer. We implement a testbed to demonstrate light-trail feasibility. We also present three medium access control protocols for light-trails and evaluate their performance. The goal of light-trails and our solution is to combine commercially available components with emerging network technologies to provide a transparent, reliable, and highly scalable communication network.",

   "abstract": "The spread of wireless portable devices is opening new market opportunities to provide entertainment services to a growing number of potential users. A notable deployment scenario is represented by limited spatial regions, such as stadiums, railway stations, and airports, with a high number of simultaneously present mobile wireless peers (dense MANETs). The provisioning of entertainment services (e.g., the distribution of news, movie trailers, songs, and game components) in dense MANETs is a challenging task, hard to achieve in a scalable way with traditional static network infrastructures. We propose lightweight autonomic dissemination of entertainment services that exploits impromptu collaborations among mobile wireless peers to replicate resources in an efficient and lazily consistent way. In particular, we have developed the REDMAN middleware to manage, retrieve, and disseminate replicas of data/service components transparently from the point of view of service developers, thus facilitating the realization of widescale entertainment services. REDMAN implements novel lightweight solutions to identify dense MANETs, maintain the desired resource replication degree, and efficiently perform resource retrieval, by exploiting the assumptions of relatively high and almost constant node density to achieve scalability and limited network overhead.",

We design appropriate receiver algorithms, and compare their performance to competing schemes in a single-cell system. We then evaluate the performance of the scheme in a seven-cell system with universal frequency reuse. The proposed MIMO scheme improves throughput significantly compared to the corresponding single-antenna communications even in the presence of spatial correlation.",

   "abstract": "XML technology is penetrating the network management in the IETF, UPnP, and DSL forum suite of standards and protocols. The advantages of XML are offered at the cost of long byte streams due to XML's inherently verbose nature. The increase in packet size for remote configuration and management can pose problems, if executed in a point-to-multipoint arrangement comprising one automatic configuration server and thousands of home gateways and multimedia devices. We investigate and exploit the repetitive nature of text patterns in typical XML documents as produced by the configuration and management tasks and as coded in SOAP RPCs. The solution mainly comes from application of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, with minimal additions in the proposed DSL Forum standard. Numerical and experimental results support the applicability and advantages of the proposed approach and provide insight on how these are attributable to different layers of the employed protocol stack.",

   "abstract": "Peer-to-peer systems and network management are usually related to each other because the traffic loads of P2P systems have to be controlled to avoid regular network services becoming unavailable due to network congestion. In this context, from a network operation point of view, P2P systems often mean problems. In this article we take a different perspective and look at P2P technologies as an alternative to improve current network management solutions. We introduce an approach where P2P networks are used as flexible interdomain distributed management systems able to provide facilities often absent in traditional management systems. We present three examples of P2P-based network management: how managed network views can be shared in a P2P network, how P2P-based application layer routing can improve connectivity between management entities, and how groups of peers can be used to process management tasks in a balanced way. Our main goal is to show that P2P technologies are a feasible tool for network management, and thus motivate further investigations on the subject.",

To ensure efficient transmission, an EPON system must employ a MAC mechanism to arbitrate access to the shared medium in order to avoid data collisions in the upstream direction and at the same time efficiently share the upstream transmission bandwidth among all ONUs. The purpose of this article is to provide a good understanding of the MAC issue, discuss the major problems involved (e.g., multiple access, bandwidth allocation, transmission scheduling, and quality of service support), and present an overview of the state-of-the-art solutions proposed thus far to the problems. It is also our purpose to motivate further studies on the problems described in this article",

   "abstract": "In spite of the massive efforts in researching and developing mobile ad hoc networks in the last decade, this type of network has not yet witnessed mass market deployment. The low commercial penetration of products based on ad hoc networking technology could be explained by noting that the ongoing research is mainly focused on implementing military or specialized civilian applications. On the other hand, users are interested in general-purpose applications where high bandwidth and open access to the Internet are consolidated and cheap commodities. To turn mobile ad hoc networks into a commodity, we should move to more pragmatic \"opportunistic ad hoc networking\" in which multihop ad hoc networks are not isolated self-configured networks, but rather emerge as a flexible and low-cost extension of wired infrastructure networks coexisting with them. Indeed, a new class of networks is emerging from this view: mesh networks. This article provides an overview of mesh networking technology. In particular, starting from commercial case studies we describe the core building blocks and distinct features on which wireless mesh networks should be based. We provide a survey of the current state of the art in off-the-shelf and proprietary solutions to build wireless mesh networks.

   "abstract": "Multicast was one of the first \"value-added\" services to be developed and deployed in the Internet. In evaluating the success of multicast, if ubiquitous deployment has been the goal, multicast has not been successful. However, if widespread use of multicast as a bandwidth-saving technique has been the goal, multicast has indeed been successful. Upon closer investigation, one of the reasons for only partial success is a lack of support for service management. Multicast is particularly hard to manage interdomain where it has been less successful, but easier to manage within a domain where network administrators have more control and smaller networks to manage. In this article we survey some of the recent service management efforts, efforts that have been successful intradomain, but fall short for interdomain. In particular, we focus on important topics like monitoring multicast reachability between sources and receivers; understanding the different challenges and solutions between inter- and intradomain service management; and surveying existing solutions to determine whether multicast capability exists on an end-to-end path. Our investigation shows that while not much attention was initially given to multicast service management, more recent efforts have been successful at developing good solutions and tools.",

Katz et al., Sept. 2003) (K. Kompella et al., Oct 2003). As a next step, reproducing the current trend of switching layers' integration happening in the data plane, network control is foreseen to go beyond the traditional per layer approach and tend toward an integrated model (K. Shimoto et al., Oct 2004) (E. Dotaro et al., Dec. 2004). In these multilayer environments, a single GMPLS control plane drives various distinct switching layers at the same time and as a coherent whole, taking benefit from the \"common\" property of GMPLS. Beyond this application of supporting network control across different technologies, in this article we catalog the unified traffic engineering paradigms, discuss their applicability, and present their enforcement techniques. Furthermore, we show that the common GMPLS concept has the advantage of low operational complexity, and enables unified TE capabilities such as efficient network resource usage and rapid service provisioning.",

   "abstract": "Network-centric warfare must leverage off a common network to support different purposes. While group communications based on a single virtual ring overlay may satisfy the most important requirements for survivability and security, scalability may for cc redesign because a single ring generally has higher delay and delay jitter. In order to provide scalability as the number of group members grows, large single rings may be broken into, smaller multirings interconnected together. Thus, comparing the characteristics of different multiring techniques provides insight into which battlespace applications may be supported via virtual rings. In this article we consider different approaches to providing scalable battlespace group communications using multi-ring techniques, classifying the techniques according to the primary military requirements of QoS, security, and survivability. Some important design issues of multiring techniques, such as the number of ring levels and number of rings per level, are dependent on, application QoS requirements and the underlying network infrastructure in terms of topology (dense vs. sparse) and link bandwidths (bottleneck capacities). Through our survey, we conclude that while no existing multiring scheme provides the single solution to battlespace group communications, some aspects of existing multiring schemes do match specific scenarios and provide us useful insights for designing new schemes for battlespace group communication. To our knowledge, this is the first article to survey and categorize multiring algorithms.",

These applications call for an extensible and securable signaling protocol.

   "abstract": "Configuration management is critical to correct and efficient operation of large networks. Where the users and networks are dynamic and ad hoc, manual configuration quickly becomes too complex. The combination of the sheer number of nodes with heterogeneity and dynamics makes it almost impossible for the system administrator to ensure good configuration or even correct operation. To achieve the vision of pervasive computing, nodes must automatically discover their environment and self-configure, then automatically reconfigure to adapt to changes. Protocols such as DHCP, DDNS, and mDNS provide some degree of host autoconfiguration, but network administrators must still configure information such as address pools, routing protocols, and OSPF routing areas. Only limited progress has been made in automating the configuration of routers, servers, and network topology. We propose the first unified attempt to combine both self-configuration of much of the host, router, and server information with automatic generation and maintenance of hierarchy under the same algorithmic framework. Testbed implementations show the approach is practical, while simulations reveal its scalability, rapidity, and efficiency with respect to network performance.",

   "abstract": "Capacity planning in an operational network requires continuous monitoring of network resources so that corrective actions can be taken in response to changes in traffic patterns, performance requirements, and network technology. In this article we characterize network resources in terms of capacity, utilization, and efficiency, and define these metrics as functions of the sets of constraints under which the network is operating. These constraints may include service level agreement objectives, routing policy constraints, and failure survivability requirements. Constraint-based network characterization allows a network operator to quantify the inherent capacity of a network and determine the impact of changes in operating conditions on realizable capacity. It also helps assess how well a given network design matches the set of constraints under which it is operating, how much traffic growth the network can support, and what actions need to be taken to accommodate traffic growth.",

Virtual personal overlay networks are envisaged as an extension of the basic VPN concept to network PN nodes in a secure manner. User managed and provider provisioned-based overlays are analyzed in terms of scalability, management complexity, and security to select the most appropriate VPON deployment and management framework. The dynamic nature of PNs calls for highly flexible self-configuring and self-adaptive VPON architectures. Programmable edge routers and dynamic tunneling mechanisms can be combined to meet the requirements set by PNs. The virtual router model is used in the provider edge to ease the dynamic deployment and management of VPONs. Results of an implementation and a performance evaluation of the VR concept based on open software routers are reported.",

   "abstract": "Advances in information technology and the great proliferation of the Internet have changed nearly every aspect of the work and life of human beings. Despite progress in networked entertainment, many music professionals and enthusiasts are still sticking to the traditional way of carrying out rehearsals and concerts. Music performance in this way requires physical presence of the participants and has a number of inherent limitations. We introduce a novel system called network-centric music performance (NMP) that enables multiparty music performance through cyberspace. Our target is to support real-time multichannel natural audio streaming over the network, using audio compression schemes that can provide acceptable audio quality. A system like this is bandwidth-demanding and highly delay-sensitive, and requires synchronization of the audio streams. Hence, support from the underlying end systems and networks is critical. However, the current source coding mechanisms and the best effort nature of the internet pose many challenges to achieve the desired quality of service. We have implemented a prototype of NMP, and exploited end system and network influences on NMP. The work was done in a LAN environment using Linux PCs. The system enables two different application scenarios: real-time rehearsal and rehearsal on demand. Real-time multichannel audio transport and different audio compression schemes are supported. Our evaluation results based on both subjective and objective measurements show that the system provides sufficient audio quality level for the target application in such an environment. The scalability test also revealed that the system scales well with increase of clientele. In the future, we extend our system for networks spanning larger distances and experiment with more realistic network conditions in the Internet.",

   "abstract": "The large-scale adoption of network-centric entertainment systems rests on the ability to provide reliable, low-cost, and secure services for all parties in the entertainment distribution system. The use of modern data networks such as the Internet to communicate digital entertainment media is motivated, in part, by advancements in communication networking, signal processing, and storage technologies that facilitate more flexible and granular business models. This same technological progress can also be shown to equip potential \"attackers\" with the means to more easily violate system security. A broad class of system security issues for entertainment applications is addressed by the growing field of digital rights management. This article focuses on an aspect of DRM that involves multicast entertainment media distribution using digital encryption and digital fingerprinting technologies to prevent widespread piracy. The goal of DRM is to provide protection and facilitate equitable compensation for all parties in the entertainment distribution chain including content creators, aggregators, distributors, and consumers. Previous security proposals to protect entertainment media have sacrificed broadcast efficiency for security. This article collectively addresses security and broadcast efficiency for network-centric entertainment systems, an area of research seldom explored. We present the challenges, technological solutions, and future trends of this emerging field.",

   "abstract": "Multiple architectures, technologies, and standards have been proposed for storage area networks, typically in the WAN environment. The transport aspect of storage signifies that optical communications is the key underlying technology. The contemporary SAN over optical network concept uses the optical layer for pure transport with minimal intelligence. This leads to high cost and overprovisioning. Future optical networks, however, can be expected to play a role in optimizing SAN extension into the WAN. An essential characteristic of SAN systems is tight coupling between nodes in a SAN network. Nodes in a SAN system have two critical functions that are presently emulated by data layers and can be offloaded to the optical layer. First, nodes need to signal among each other to achieve tasks such as synchronous and asynchronous storage. Second, to benefit from an optimized network, nodes need to allocate bandwidth dynamically in real time. In this article we show how the optical layer can be furthered from just pure transport to creating opportunities in provisioning as well as providing the mirroring function of SAN systems (multicasting) and consequently lead to reduction in cost. We demonstrate that the light-trail model is one way of efficiently utilizing the optical layer for SAN.",

Smart, autonomous, and self-aware: that is the ultimate vision for WSNs. The success of this vision depends fundamentally on the self-management solutions. This work deals with this challenge: to provide a self-management solution for a WSN that monitors temperature and evaluates fire risks. We focus on self-organization, self-configuration, self-service, and self-maintenance. In particular, we propose service negotiation policies to demonstrate the self-service concept. The results reveal that the management solution can promote the productivity of network resources and the quality of the provided services.",

   "abstract": "It has been observed that complex networks such as the Internet, World Wide Web, social networks, and biological systems are self-organizing in nature and exhibit some common properties such as the power law degree distribution. Recently, two models (i.e., small world and scale-free network models) have been proposed and successfully used to describe the nature of such networks. In this article we investigate whether these concepts can also be applied to cellular wireless networks, which typically do not exhibit self-organizing or scalability properties due to the limited range of the wireless nodes. Our ultimate goal is to design robust, reliable, scalable, and efficiently utilized wireless networks via self-organizing mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "Frequencies above 25 GHz represent a great opportunity for BFWA systems because of the extraordinary bandwidths available. But standards for high-frequency BFWA published so far have not been able to unleash this potential. We believe this is due to the fact that the performance characteristics have been shaped considering these systems in isolation. This has brought on a mismatch between what these systems can offer and what is really needed. Most of today's broadband networks focus on data communication. We focus on how to make high-frequency BFWA systems fit better into the architecture required for fulfilling the \"broadband for all\" vision (i.e., including more video streaming and transfer). By modifying and extending the standards to fulfill the performance requirements implied, high-frequency BFWA systems can play an important role in future high-capacity broadband networks with flexible resource allocation.",

   "abstract": "Ethernet's-move into metropolitan and wide area networks is driving a rapidly growing market opportunity. Current Ethernet services come in two basic flavors, Ethernet line and LAN, providing point-to-point and multipoint connectivity, respectively. The LAN services, although more cost effective, are lagging behind in deployments due to associated QoS and bandwidth provisioning issues. The Ethernet service provider needs to provision the network to meet current and future traffic demands, where the traffic is unpredictable and bursty. The goal is to minimize. overprovisioning and complexity. To add to the challenge, Ethernet routing is based on simple self-learning and relies on spanning tree routing. In this article we propose an Ethernet-specific load balanced routing mechanism, which is robust to dynamic traffic demand. It significantly reduces overprovisioning, is simple and static, and requires only bandwidth profiles associated with service level agreements at the ingress and egress links. Our simulation results show that our scheme provides performance improvements over a recently proposed approach for switched Ethernet as well as a related load balancing approach for Ethernet over MPLS networks.",

   "abstract": "The transport layer in the network protocol stack serves as a liaison between the application and the underlying network. Any quality of service provided by the network thus has to be effectively translated by the transport layer protocol in order to be enjoyed by the applications. In this article, we argue for a fundamental rethinking of the transport layer design to facilitate such QoS delivery. We identify the key requirement for a QoS enabling transport layer protocol as the ability to effectively handle multiplicity in terms of user differentiation levels, network resources, and service models. However, TCP, the transport layer protocol predominantly used in the Internet, is unable to support such multiplicity due to its single-state design. We extend TCP to a parallel transport layer protocol called parallel TCP (pTCP) that can tackle the different dimensions of multiplicity, and hence enable varying classes of QoS to applications. We discuss the applicability of pTCP in three specific domains with different levels of network support for QoS, and present simulation results substantiating our arguments.",

   "abstract": "Addressing quality of service in military wireless ad hoc communication networks involves unique challenges due to imposed tactical requirements and,conditions, such as heterogeneous traffic with stringent-real-time and survivability requirements, mobile wireless nodes in hostile environments, and limited spectrum availability. Encryption adds another layer of complexity because of the partitioning of the network into plain text (unencrypted) and cipher text (encrypted) parts that, by definition, cannot communicate QoS information to one another. A typical communication shelter is composed of unencrypted LANs connected to a packet-encrypted backbone network. This article presents a partitioned QoS approach, focusing on QoS management at the unencrypted LAN that complements QoS management done at the encrypted backbone. Some of the unencrypted LAN QoS techniques being considered for the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (the future Army tactical backbone network) are outlined.",

   "abstract": "During the last few years, the cdma2000/spl reg/ cellular system has undergone a major enhancement within the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2. The objective of this enhancement was to improve the bandwidth efficiency of the cdma2000 system by creating a new set of high-speed packet data channels, the forward packet data channel and the reverse packet data channel. This new set of high-speed packet data channels utilize technologies such as fast packet scheduling, hybrid automatic repeat request, and adaptive modulation and coding. This article discusses the performance evaluation aspect of the high-speed packet enhancement of cdma2000 revisions C and D, the so-called 1/spl times/EV-DV system. Insights into how the performance evaluations of cdma2000 revisions C and D were conducted, and the results of these evaluations are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Ongoing technological advances in portable devices, coupled with the need for continuous connectivity while mobile, have made ad hoc networks a compelling research and development topic, particularly in a challenging multimedia multihop scenario. The ability of IEEE 802.11's ad hoc mode of operation, as a dominating wireless local area network (WLAN) protocol, to serve multihop networks requires thorough investigation. In this article, through considering crucial real-life physical phenomena and avoiding as many confining assumptions as possible, system performance measures such as delay and packet failure rate are evaluated. As a result, the importance of adequate selection of the system parameters toward performance improvement is underscored. Moreover, the simulation results imply that by complementing through priority provisions, coordination, route reservation, clustering, and optimum channel coding considerations, the IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocol can survive in a multihop scenario. The custom simulation environment developed features modularity, comprising traffic generator, mobility, wireless channel, and IEEE 802.11 protocol modules, and is capable of accommodating many more of the physical phenomena involved.",

   "abstract": "Although 802.11 is initially designed for infrastructure-based networks, the distributed coordination function allows mobiles to access the radio medium without the need for a base station. Thus, studies in wireless multihop networks, also called ad hoc networks, often rely on the use of IEEE 802.11 for the physical and MAC layers. However, for a couple of years the use of 802.11 in ad hoc networks has been discussed. Different scenarios show serious performance issues. The performance offered by 802.11 is often low and directly impacts the performance of higher-layer protocols. In this article we provide a summary of the different performance issues extracted so far. We classify basic situations according to the main effects. We then present a quick survey of the possible solutions to these problems. This classification is intended to help design appropriate MAC protocols dedicated to ad hoc networks.",

   "abstract": "The newly applied H-ARQ technique in the reverse link of a cdma2000/spl reg/ 1/spl times/EV-DV system is shown to be similar in nature to the fast power control technique such that the two techniques both reduce interference to other users. In order to balance the H-ARQ gain and packet delay time, four modes of operation are defined: normal, reduction, boost, and boost reduction. The four modes are defined according to the way the channel gain is set for the H-ARQ operation. Simulation results show that the reduction modes have better performance in terms of both PER and packet delay time. It is also shown that the boost modes have lower PER and packet delay time than the non-boost modes, but at the expense of more energy.",

   "abstract": "The group addressing model currently employed for supporting IP multicast has caused several implementation issues including global unique address allocation, sender admission control, and multicast forwarding state scalability. In this article we first review related work carried out to address these issues using different mechanisms and at different levels. We discuss their merits and deficiencies and also their possible combinations for improved performance. We then devise a protocol that works by introducing the idea of recursive unicast into an existing multicast routing protocol, multicast extension to OSPF (MOSPF), to achieve scalable multicast. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the high performance of the devised protocol in reducing computational overhead and forwarding state at routers and also in casing address allocation and admission control.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an architecture for supporting interdomain QoS across the multi-provider global Internet. While most research to date has focused on supporting QoS within a single administrative domain, mature solutions are not yet available for the provision of QoS across multiple domains administered by different organizations. The architecture described in this article encompasses the full set of functions required in the management (service and resource), control and data planes for the provision of end-to-end QoS-based IP connectivity services. We use the concept of QoS classes and show how these can be cascaded using service level specifications (SLSs) agreed between BGP peer domains to construct a defined end-to-end QoS. We illustrate the architecture by describing a typical operational scenario.",

   "abstract": "QoS routing plays an important role for providing QoS in wireless ad hoc networks. The goals of QoS routing are in general twofold: selecting routes with satisfied QoS requirement(s), and achieving global efficiency in resource utilization. In this article we first discuss some key design considerations in providing QoS routing support, and present a review of previous work addressing the issue of route selection subject to QoS constraint(s). We then devise an on-demand delay-constrained unicast routing protocol. Various strategies are employed in the protocol to reduce the communication overhead in acquiring cost-effective delay-constrained routes. Simulation results are used to verify our expectation of the high performance of the devised protocol. Finally, we discuss some possible future directions for providing efficient QoS routing support in wireless ad hoc networks.",

TD-SCDMA was proposed by the China Wireless Technology Standard (CWTS) Group in 1998, approved as one of the 3G standards by ITU in May 2000, and joined 3GPP in March 2001. This has been a major effort by China to advance its mobile communication systems and facilitate its own technological development in this critical area. TD-SCDMA, a combination of TDD and synchronous CDMA, offers several unique advantages over its alternatives, WCDMA and cdma2000, such as flexible spectrum allocation, low-cost implementation, and easier migration from GSM systems.

One of the key questions is what is the role of, and how do we control, an optical switch core within a SAN to optimize its performance. In this article we review two potential optical switch technologies and assess their performance as a SAN optical switch core.",

As one of its applications, online gaming attracts a huge group of fans playing over the Internet. It has new requirements for relative QoS. This article gives a brief introduction to these new QoS requirements, and then presents an algorithm to satisfy these requirements in the differentiated services network for client-server-topology-based online gaming services.

SANs can be extended over distances spanning from hundreds to thousands of kilometers with optical or IP-based transport networks. The network equipment used depends on the storage protocol used for the extension solution. The present article provides analytical models developed for the calculation of long-term average downtimes, service failure rates, and service availability that can be achieved as a function of hardware/software failures, software upgrades, link failures, failure recovery times, and layer 3 protocol convergence times.",

As a preliminary research work on next-generation mobile communications, we exploit what next-generation mobile services will be (S. Ryu et al., May 2003). We define next-generation mobile services as a hierarchy of services consisting of three different service levels: the service areas, the service functionalities, and the service technologies. We derive these service levels by means of scenario-based analysis. Next we propose conceptual reference network architecture, focusing on the realization of the service technologies. We divide the network into four different parts: a user equipments and access part, a network service provisioning layer part, a network control layer part, and non-mobile network operator service pan, according to characteristics of information and service flows within a network. In this reference network architecture, service elements such as servers, processors, and gateways are placed in each network part to support the derived next-generation mobile services. Finally, we give a brief introduction of research and development activities for next-generation mobile communication systems and services in Korea.",

   "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet-based applications calls for design of a high-speed wireless packet data communication system. This anticipated increase in future mobile wireless packet data services has challenged the current 3G standardization bodies to respond with evolved 3G system specifications capable of providing increased data throughput. In response to such a need, 3GPP2 recently completed the enhanced reverse link standardization effort of the CDMA technology flagship, cdma2000/spl reg/ by completing the definition of the 1/spl times/EV-DV 1/spl times/ system. 1/spl times/EV-DV achieves higher data throughput while simultaneously providing coexisting and backward-compatible voice services within the same spectrum. This feature of 1/spl times/EV-DV allows wireless operators to manage the voice and data loading in their system more efficiently. This article describes the physical layer reverse link enhancements in cdma2000 revision D that are necessary to support 1/spl times/EV-DV.",

   "abstract": "For multihop wireless networks, a fundamental question is whether it is advantageous to route over many short hops (short-hop routing) or over a smaller number of longer hops (long-hop routing). Short-hop routing has gained a lot of support, and its proponents mainly produce two arguments: reduced energy consumption and higher signal-to-interference ratios. Both arguments stem from a simplified analysis based on crude channel models that neglects delay, end-to-end reliability, bias power consumption, the impact of channel coding, mobility, and routing overhead. In this article we shed more light on these issues by listing 18 reasons why short-hop routing is not as beneficial as it seems to be. We also provide experimental evidence to support this claim. The conclusion is that for many networks, long-hop routing is in every aspect a very competitive strategy.",

In revision D, the reverse link peak data rate has been increased by an order of magnitude from 153.6 kb/s to 1.8 Mb/s, and the reverse link sector throughput has been improved significantly (from about 280 kb/s to 600 kb/s). The key enabling mechanisms to achieve these enhancements include a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol, adaptive higher order modulation and coding schemes, and advanced radio resource management schemes. It is well known that the reverse link is interference limited, so the system resource of interest is reverse link interference. cdma2000 Revision D introduces a variety of flexible medium access control mechanisms to allocate appropriate reverse link resources for mobile stations with various service requirements. Moreover, cdma2000 revision D greatly enhances quality of service support for the reverse link.",

   "abstract": "Optical access networks are considered to be a definite solution to the problem of upgrading current congested access networks to ones capable of delivering future broadband integrated services. However, the high deployment and maintenance cost of traditional point-to-point architectures is a major economic barrier. Current TDM-PON architectures are economically feasible, but bandwidth-limited. In this article we first discuss the possible role of WDM in access networks and investigate the associated issues. We then present the Stanford University Access Hybrid WDM/TDM Passive Optical Network (SUCCESS-HPON), a next-generation hybrid WDM/TDM optical access architecture that focuses on providing a smooth migration path from current TDM-PONs to future WDM-PONs. The first testbed for this architecture is described, along with the experimental results obtained, including feasibility of bidirectional transmission on the same wavelength on the same fiber for access networks and ONU modulation of upstream data on continuous waves provided by the OLT, eliminating the need for tunable components at the ONUs. The development of a second testbed and the issues it will address, including the implementability of the SUCCESS-HPON MAC protocol and scheduling algorithms, are also described.",

We present three example attacks an attacker could mount on the scheme, point out the weaknesses we exploited, and suggest how to counter them. Our attacks are variants of the replay attack to which any security scheme should be resistant. Such attacks are easy to mount since they simply require replaying previous valid messages, and are often passive attacks and thus hard to detect. Therefore, our results are devastating since they show that the scheme has failed to achieve its main objective of establishing mutual authentication between legitimate parties.",

   "abstract": "The trend toward ubiquitous wireless communication demands for a higher level of self-organization in networks. This article gives an introduction and overview on this topic and investigates the fundamental question: What are design paradigms for developing a self-organized network function? We propose four paradigms and show how they are reflected in current protocols: design local interactions that achieve global properties, exploit implicit coordination, minimize the maintained state, and design protocols that adapt to changes. Finally, we suggest a general design process for self-organized network functions.",

   "abstract": "Node misbehavior due to selfish or malicious reasons or faulty nodes can significantly degrade the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. To cope with misbehavior in such self-organized networks, nodes need to be able to automatically adapt their strategy to changing levels of cooperation. Existing approaches such as economic incentives or secure routing by cryptography alleviate some of the problems, but not all. We describe the use of a self-policing mechanism based on reputation to enable mobile ad hoc networks to keep functioning despite the presence of misbehaving nodes. The reputation system in all nodes makes them detect misbehavior locally by observation and use of second-hand information. Once a misbehaving node is detected it is automatically isolated from the network. We classify the features of such reputation systems and describe possible implementations of each of them. We explain in particular how it is possible to use second-hand information while mitigating contamination by spurious ratings.",

   "abstract": "Enterprises are increasingly using virtual private networks to interconnect remote sites. Traditionally, service providers have used ATM core networks to deliver layer 2 services such as frame relay, ATM, or TDM private lines, which enterprise customers have then used to build their corporate network infrastructure. Such services account for the majority of data service revenues today. However, pressure has increased on service providers to combine increased flexibility with reduced costs in the context of a highly dynamic telecommunications market. Service providers also need to generate new revenues from their IP network infrastructure, through new opportunities such as IP VPNs and virtual private LAN services, while simultaneously achieving operational efficiencies through the convergence of all of their services on a common MPLS backbone. New access and metro network technologies, such as Ethernet, are also emerging that can be used to deliver these new services to enterprise customers alongside ATM and frame relay access. This must be achieved while also supporting existing technologies such as ATM, which continue to deliver highly profitable services. This article discusses the technical challenges in meeting the often conflicting requirements of delivering both traditional layer 2 services and new layer 3 services on a converged MPLS network. We show how both network and service interworking are required, and how these must operate at the user, control, and management planes to enable profitable services to be delivered over the new converged network. The different solutions being defined in the standards bodies are described, and the distinct scenarios they address are explained.",

The expected performance is in the class of supercomputers, but delivered with limited energy and memory bandwidth for embedded systems. This article advocates a streaming computation model that leverages the deterministic access patterns in imaging applications to deliver the necessary processing throughput. A reconfigurable datapath connects a set of functional units, forming a computation pipeline to offer energy efficiency. The architecture and implementation of a stream processor are presented along with the memory subsystem to support stream data transfers. The results show speedup ranging from a factor of 2 to 28 for imaging applications, offering favorable comparison against scalar processors.",

   "abstract": "The deployment of passive optical networks for broadband access has been largely recognized as a promising solution to open the first-/last-mile bottleneck. We propose and demonstrate a new hybrid TDM/WDM PON architecture that jointly serves multiple physical PONs to enjoy statistical multiplexing gain as well as cost sharing. This article describes design and implementation issues of the key building blocks, including fast tunable lasers, burst-mode receivers, and scheduling algorithms with quality of service support. A prototype testbed is constructed, and transmission experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of the integrated system. Coexistence with current PONs and future evolutional paths are described as well. Experimental explorations of the new network architecture involve advanced photonic and electronic subsystems, which inspires developments of the next-generation optical access networks.",

A modular platform is presented that can be used for developing system specifications and prototyping designs. This prototype modulates data with binary phase shift keyed pulses, communicates over a wireless link using UWB antennas and a wideband direct conversion front-end, and samples the received signal for demodulation. Design considerations are introduced for a custom chipset that operates in the 3.1-10.6 GHz band. The chipset is being designed using the results from the discrete prototype.",

   "abstract": "The Internet provides a platform for rapid and timely information exchange among a disparate array of clients and servers. TCP and IP are separately designed and closely tied protocols that define the rules of communication between end hosts, and are the most commonly used protocol suite for data transfer in the Internet. The combination of TCP/IP dominates today's communication in various networks from the wired backbone to the heterogeneous network due to its remarkable simplicity and reliability, TCP has become the de facto standard used in most applications ranging from interactive sessions such as Telnet and HTTP, to bulk data transfer like FTP. TCP was originally designed primarily for wired networks. In a wired network, random bit error rate, a characteristic usually more pronounced in the wireless network, is negligible, and congestion is the main cause of packet loss. The emerging wireless applications, especially high-speed multimedia services and the advent of wireless IP communications carried by the Internet, call for calibration and sophisticated enhancement or modifications of this protocol suite for improved performance. Based on the assumption that packet losses are signals of network congestion, the additive increase multiplicative decrease congestion control of the standard TCP protocol reaches the steady state, which reflects the protocol's efficiency in terms of throughput and link utilization. However, this assumption does not hold when the end-to-end path also includes wireless links. Factors such as high BER, unstable channel characteristics, and user mobility may all contribute to packet losses. Many studies have shown that the unmodified standard TCP performs poorly in a wireless environment due to its inability to distinguish packet losses caused by network congestion from those attributed to transmission errors. In this article, following a brief introduction to TCP, we analyze the problems TCP exhibits in the wireless IP communication environment, and illustrate viable solutions by detailed examples.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a brief overview, state of the art, and taxonomy of optical WDM testbeds, and outlines the differences between them and the ADRENALINE testbed. ADRENALINE is an optical circuit-switched WDM testbed that deploys reconfigurable OADMs based on various technologies (e.g., AWG and tunable lasers). In ADRENALINE, end-to-end lightpaths are set up and torn down dynamically and in real time by means of a GMPLS-based control plane (switched connections) and a distributed management plane (soft-permanent connections). ADRENALINE supports the request of SPCs under user initiative by combining GMPLS, SNMP, and XML. ADRENALINE allows both the topology and major characteristics of the data communications network to be modified, enabling control and management related experiments with varying DCN. In our experiments we investigate user management of lightpaths and address its performance in terms of basic SLA parameters related to connection establishment (delay and availability). Finally, we address remaining challenges and outline exciting avenues of future work on ADRENALINE.",

   "abstract": "A new network clustering concept for foresighted driving applications is introduced, taking into account the specific requirements for highly dynamic intervehicle networks. Considering the initially low system penetration in the market, the concept includes the so-called message relay boxes without backbone network connection for temporary roadside storage of messages. The article differentiates between moving and quasi-stationary applications and explains how clusters tied to specific geographic locations leads to even more complicated mechanisms for topology management in clustered ad hoc networks. A proposed message handling algorithm for cluster establishment shows the complexity needed to guarantee overall data consistency and network reliability as required for safety-relevant cooperative systems.",

   "abstract": "With the evolution of wireless technologies, the optimization process for the radio access network has undergone a dramatic increase in complexity. This trend is driven by the introduction of multiple objectives for packet data services, the increasing network heterogeneity resulting from technology overlays, and the growing demand for nondisruptive optimization of operating networks. In a multidisciplinary effort, Bell Laboratories has developed a new optimization methodology that tackles these challenges using automated processes. We show that the paradigm shift toward automation requires the development of several interdependent algorithms each designed to cope with a particular optimization task. In the application described, human intervention proves indispensable; it demands a new kind of expertise that combines understanding of the automated processes with knowledge of network operation. Through examples we illustrate the variety of tasks that have to be automated and where guidance is needed through human control. The development of these automated processes is an important step toward dynamic optimization routines that are integrated into the network and adjust the network in a real-time manner.",

   "abstract": "Tactical military coalition force IP networks will have to offer quality of service. Service level agreements and service level specifications are important elements of the QoS architecture in civilian networks. However, SLAs/SLSs in military coalition networks should not be applied in the same fashion as in a commercial network. Our contribution is to identify the useful role SLAs/SLSs can play in network engineering and QoS management of tactical coalition force networks. The SLS definition needs to be more detailed than for a commercial SLS, and its monitoring must be performed on a finer timescale than in comparable commercial networks. The security architecture of military coalition networks may also restrict the monitoring and SLA management. Finally, we sketch a measurement-based approach showing how SLSs can be used in tactical military coalition force networks to support both call admission control and network engineering. Parts of this analysis include a discussion of SLSs and the proposed NATO standards for tactical communications network.",

   "abstract": "This study first reviews state-of-the-art fast handoff techniques for IEEE 802.11 or Mobile IP networks. Based on that review, topology-aided cross-layer fast handoff designs are proposed for Mobile IP over IEEE 802.1.1 networks. Time-sensitive applications, such as voice over IP (VoIP), cannot tolerate the long layer-2 plus layer-3 handoff delays that arise in IEEE 802.11/Mobile IP environments. Cross-layer designs are increasingly adopted to shorten the handoff latency time. Handoff-related layer-2 triggers may reduce the delay between layer-2 handoff completion and the associated layer-3 handoff activation. Cross-layer topology information, such as the association between 802.11 access points and Mobile IP mobility agents, together with layer-2 triggers, can be utilized by a mobile node to start layer-3 handoff-related activities, such as agent discovery, address configuration, and registration, in parallel with or prior to those of layer-2 handoff. Experimental results indicate that the whole handoff. delay can meet the delay requirement of VoIP applications when layer-3 handoff activities occur prior to layer-2 handoffs.",

   "abstract": "The integrity of the Internet is severely impaired by rampant denial of service and distributed DoS attacks. It is by no means trivial to devise a countermeasure to address these attacks because of their anonymous and distributed nature. This article presents a brief survey of the most promising recently proposed schemes for tracing cyber attacks: IP traceback. Since IP traceback technology is evolving rapidly, for the community to better comprehend and capture the properties of disparate traceback approaches, we first classify these schemes from multiple aspects. From the perspective of practicality and feasibility, we then analyze and explore the advantages and disadvantages of these schemes in depth so that shortcomings and possible enhancements of each scheme are highlighted. Finally, open problems and future work are discussed, and concluding remarks are drawn.",

   "abstract": "We are interested in the design of physical-layer-aware medium access control for self-organized low-power low-data-rate impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-.UWB) networks.. In such networks energy consumption is much more of a concern than achieved data rates. So far, a number of different solutions have been proposed in the context of data rate efficiency for IR-UWB. However, the choices made for rate-efficient designs are not necessarily optimal when considering energy efficiency. Hence, there is a need to understand the design trade-offs in very low-power networks, which is the aim of this article. To this end, we first identify what a PHY-aware MAC design has to achieve: interference management, access to a destination, and sleep cycle management. Second, we analyze how these functions can be implemented, and provide a list of the many possible building blocks that have been proposed in the literature. Third, we use this classification to analyze fundamental design choices. We propose a method for evaluating energy consumption already in the design phase of IR-UWB systems. Last, we apply this methodology and derive a set of guidelines; they can be used by system architects to orientate fundamental choices early in the design process.",

   "abstract": "Advances in wavelength-division multiplexing technology have made it possible to design point-to-point transmission systems with unprecedented per-wavelength high capacity. This capacity may be exploited to design optical networks, in which end nodes are interconnected by circuits consisting of wavelengths. Contrary to early expectations, however, most of today's end-to-end applications require only sub-wavelength bandwidth. This bandwidth mismatch makes wavelength circuits inefficient in many cases, unless multiple traffic flows are time multiplexed together on the same wavelength. This practice is often referred to as traffic grooming. In this survey the authors address the issue of achieving efficient traffic grooming in static WDM networks. A great deal of discussion is devoted to the problem of determining which network solution is the most cost effective, taking into account the network topology, volume of traffic, possible optical impairments at high transmission rates, and cost ratio between electronic and optical components.",

   "abstract": "Ultra-wideband wireless communications techniques have many merits, including an extremely simple radio that inherently leads to low-cost design, large processing gain for robust operations in the presence of narrowband interference, covert operations, and fine time resolution for accurate position sensing. However, there are a number of challenges in UWB receiver design, such as capturing multipath energy, intersymbol interference especially in a non-line-of-sight environment, and the need for high-sampling-rate analog-to-digital converters. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of UWB multiple access and modulation schemes, and their comparison with narrowband radios. We also outline the issues with UWB signal reception and detection, and explore various suboptimal low-complexity receiving schemes.",

It provides on-demand dedicated high-bandwidth channels for large data transfers, and also high-resolution high-precision channels for fine control operations. In the initial deployment its data plane consists of several thousand miles of dual 10 Gb/s lambdas. The channels are provisioned on demand using layer 1 and 2 switches in the backbone and multiple service provisioning platforms at the edges in a flexible configuration using a secure control plane. A centralized scheduler is employed to compute future channel allocations, and a signaling daemon is used to generate the configuration signals to switches at appropriate times. The control plane is implemented using an out-of-band virtual private network, which encrypts the switching signals, and also provides authenticated user and application access. Transport experiments are conducted on a smaller test connection that provides us useful information about the basic properties and issues of utilizing dedicated channels in applications.",

   "abstract": "As societies become increasingly mobile and more dependent on information technologies, their radio spectrum also needs change. The basic spectrum management structure in all countries was developed over a long period, and much of the basic framework has remained stable for decades. The FCC is interested in making more spectrum available to unlicensed devices because of the explosive growth of IEEE 802.11/Wi-Fi unlicensed wireless LAN technology, and because the FCC recognizes that there is a great deal of \"white space\" that could be exploited by unlicensed devices. The FCC proposal selected the TV bands as an initial home for cognitive radio based on several factors. First, the frequencies used for TV can give greater range in rural areas than the microwave frequencies used for Wi-Fi, and can also give better building penetration than Wi-Fi in all areas. Second, TV broadcast systems usually use high antennas, and the intended receivers need greater than 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to function. A variety of controversial issues have emerged from public comments. One concern is that the confusion resulting from the proposal might discourage purchase of new digital televisions and hence delay the transition from analog to digital televisions. This would also delay the transfer of some current TV spectrum to new mobile uses, including public safety.",

FCS technology comprises MS tracking mechanisms, channel assignment procedures, paging mechanisms, and traffic channel initialization procedures. The combination of these techniques contributes to the improvement of the overall call setup delay. This article discusses the functional aspects of these enhancements, and their quantitative and qualitative performance.",

   "abstract": "Broadband in North America is now at critical mass, passing the inflection point from the early adopter to the early majority. In fact, Strategy Analytics predicts that by 2010, over 78 million U.S. households will have some form of broadband connectivity, much of it capable of delivering the triple play of voice, video, and high-speed Internet access. Their providers will consist of local exchange carriers, multiservice operators, and municipalities that have deployed their own triple play networks. Why the municipalities, and what do they bring to the table? In many instances, smaller cities and towns have been bypassed by the first phases of the incumbent operators' triple play deployments. For reasons of economic development, quality of living, education, and the retention of skilled workforces, the government has stepped in to fill the void. This article looks at the most ambitious municipality-driven triple play deployment in North America, the UTOPIA MetroNet in Utah. The system integrator for UTOPIA is DynamicCity, which early on defined a set of design principles that would make the network successful. These included the requirement that the network be open to multiple service providers, be carrier class, be scalable and based on future-proof technology, and that the architecture be based on open standards while keeping costs to a minimum. The article first reviews some of the considerations behind the choice of the technology and deployment approach based on these guidelines, and then describes in detail the network topology and services architecture, the current status of the deployment, and future plans. Specific topics covered include the use of multiprotocol label switching/virtual private LAN service, IP multicasting, and traffic engineering.",

Particularly considering a DiffServ/MPLS III transport network supporting multiple VNs, we propose a dynamic approach for efficient bandwidth sharing among VNs. The bandwidth sharing is service-level-agreement-based; the spare capacity in underloaded VNs is adaptively and efficiently utilized, and SLA compliance for all the VNs involved is always guaranteed.",

   "abstract": "The ubiquitous and plug-and-play characteristics of Ethernet provide a unique opportunity for service providers to-offer a variety of innovative and affordable application-centric services, resulting in a much broader networking culture. Before that can really happen, Ethernet has to overcome some challenging obstacles and prove efficient support of SLAs, at least similar to that offered by traditional layer 2 WAN technologies. In this article we describe some of the most commonly used WAN transport technologies. We compare Ethernet WAN transport to these traditional WAN technologies. We discuss QoS, CAM, security, and resilience issues. Pros and cons of Ethernet WAN transport are also enumerated.",

   "abstract": "The United States Congress is likely to revisit the Communications Act several times over the next few years. A number of critics have suggested that the FCC should simply be abolished in the course of these legislative changes that it is no longer necessary to regulate telecommunications at all. In Europe, an analogous debate manifests itself in a more nuanced fashion. It is widely anticipated that telecommunications regulation will gradually become unnecessary, and be replaced by competition law. This is largely viewed as a migration from overarching ex-ante (before the fact) prohibitions to more isolated ex-post (after the fact) responses to specific instances of anticompetitive conduct. It is timely to ask: Why do we regulate telecommunications? What might happen in the absence of regulation? Few realize that this experiment has already been attempted, and the verdict is in: outright elimination of telecommunications regulation is a bad idea. Reformist New Zealand attempted to operate with a bare minimum of sector-specific regulation for telecommunications and other network industries; by 2001 they had given it up, and instead implemented sector-specific regulation. What exactly were the consequences in New Zealand? What broke, and why? What lessons can other countries draw from this experience?.",
