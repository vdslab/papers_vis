A year ago, when asked by the Editor of the IEEE Communications Magaine if we thought that the results of such an endeavor dealing with communications and signal processing would be of value to electrical engineering faculty and working communications engineers alike, we struggled with this question. A year later, at the time of writing of this article, we are still struggling with it! In addition to not being sure of just how to analyze and organize the data, we are swamped with more information from a larger sample of electrical engineering departments than we ever dreamed possible. Given this insight into the past andcurrent start of our naivete, then, the readeris asked to acceptht is article at face value - much data, some analysis, and a few inferences. The outline of the paper is simple. We first overview the general conclusions, trends, and implications gained from the survey. We next describe how we gathered the data and how the sample of electrical engineering departments that was used as a data base evolved. Finally, the data on course offerings, textbooks used, areas of research and special investigations, and numbers of students involved are presented along with some discussion of the meaning of the presentations.

      "abstract": "The performance of digital radio will be examined along with some of the benefits accruing from its use, and finally some long-term prognostications of its future will be made. Although this article focuses primarily on 6 GHz digital radio, the reader should recognize that 2 and 11 GHz digital radio have also found widespread use. 2 CHz is used primarily for small cross sections, often finding use as a feeder for 6 and 11 GHz. Both 6 and 11 CHz areu sed for short-haul applications up to several hundred miles. 11 GHz digital radio was introduced first because the wider bandwidth available in that band eased someof the design difficulties. 6 CHz now would normally be the facility selected because of the longer hop length over which it can be engineered. This reduces the number of repeaters required and hence reduces cost. However, due to frequency congestion, 11 GHz must often be used instead. There are, in addition, 18 GHz radio systems. These systems tend to haveu nique applicationsa nd consequently have not found widespread acceptance in the United States.",

      "abstract": "It has been shown that interframe coding techniques provide an effective means to reduce the transmission bit rate of video signals without sacrificing picture quality. The channel capacity of various coding schemes over existing digital transmission links is listed. For digital satellite, for example, even a single television (TV) channel cannot be transmitted by conventional PCM, whereas one or two channels of TV can be transmitted by employing efficient coding techniques. However, much greater advantage is obtained by use of interframe coding. Three network quality TV signals can becarried through a transponder. For teleconferencing applications, a single satellite transponder can managuep to 20 simultaneous conference signals on a TDMA basis, if one uses a 3M bit/s interframe coder. Our satellite experiment has demonstrated excellent performance for network digital TV application. The TRIDEC teleconferencing system has been commercially used by NTT in Japan since 1979 and the NETEC-6/3 interframe encoder is being seriously considered for application in North American teleconferencing applications.",

It will then focus on four future systems which will be able to provide electronic message services: INTELPOST (International Electronic Post) sponsored by the US Postal Service, the SBS System by the Satellite Business Systems, the ACS (Advanced Communications Service) by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and then XTEN Network by the Xerox Corporation. Service features of these systems will be described, and their impact on worldwide electronic message services discussed.",

But the education of an engineer involves practical professional on-the-job training which today is left largely to chance. This is due to the absence of a common professional awareness shared by both educators and industrial practitioners. One of the most important tasks of the newly formed American Association of Engineering Societies wili be to create this sense of professional awareness, and if will be left to the Engineers' Council on Professional Development to translate these larger professional aims into educational goals. It is hoped that these educational goals will include the breadth and depth of a five-year basic degree, and emphasize the practical training aspects of engineering education by establishing formal guidelines for such training.",

Two radio propagation channels for beyond-thehorizon communications, troposcatter, and HF are currently being reexamined. In the past, transmission over these radio channels had been considered unreliable due to fading effects. Recently, conversion from analog to digital transmission and the use of new adaptive signal processing techniques have offered promise of acceptable network communication quality. In addition, over-the-horizon radio provides economic and/or secu-\u00b7 rity advantages relative to satellite, cable, or line-of-sight terrestrial microwave links. There is renewed interest in . the use of high frequency (HF) and troposcatter communications for networks carrying digital traffic.",

      "abstract": "The early efforts of NASA in space communications development strengthened the general level of confi. dence in the use of satellite technology for telecommunications. Soon afterward, the formation of organizations such as INTELSAT and the Comsat Corporation and their subsequent progress brought reliable communications via satellite at affordable rates. These capabilities have grown worldwide through new industries that are fostering the principles of the 1958 Space Act to exploit the peaceful benefits of space for the betterment of mankind. As a result of this recognized success arid the pressures of budget cutting, NASA's role in this pioneering effort was slowed in 1973. The flight projects then under development, the Applications Technology Satellite Six (ATS-6) and the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS) were allowed to continue but the research projects were reduced to a small ground-based effort directed toward long-term high-risk components and techniques. Now, as we enter the 1980's, the situation is reversed. The principal NASA spacecrafts are retired, but the program for research and development and flight experiments is revived.",

The most important characteristic of the satellite system is the ability of the earth stations, located at geographically dispersed areas, to access the satellite to transmit and to receive data. The area covered by a geostationary satellite is a function of the satellite's receiving and transmitting antennats). For a large number of users with bursty traffic, a highly efficient way of using the channel capacity is to use multiple access techniques. In a multiple accessed channel, two or more users may nominally share the channel. The satellite system can provide broadcast capability at any given time to all earth stations within its transmission coverage area. The combination of multiple access and broadcast capability makes it possible to configure the earth stations into a fully connected \"one-hop\" network.",

Although some truly gigantic satellites have been imagined by others, the view expressed here is that technical and economic considerations will limit satellite size through the end of this century to more modest proportions, not greatly exceeding those of satellites currently under construction. The greatest challenge in future satellite design will continue to be the attainment of improved lifetimes.",

Of these, none has been the subject of more lively discussion and revision than bandwidth. The implications of bandwidth can vary considerably from context to context, as the profusion of definitions of bandwidth will attest. The purpose of the present article is to explore the subject of data transmission bandwidth through an examination of its various definitions. The spectrum is finite, yet as technology manipulates it, a dazzling increase in bandwidth capability emerges.",

      "abstract": "At this moment the US Federal Government is deeply involved in shaping the legislation which will direct the startling changes in the telecommunications industry. The ground rules which currently govern the industry are specified in the Communications Act of 1934. This law was passed when communications consisted of a basic black telephone and a teletypewriter-computers, lasers, and fiber optics were unimagined. This law, also is largely based on the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 which was designed to correct railroad abuses. Today the overwhelming sentiment in Washington is for change. Legislation is pending in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The President, NTIA, the IEEE, and Ralph Nader's Congress Watch all have expressed opinions and outlined courses of action. The author recently went to Washingtion and spoke to people from all of these organizations. In the following interview, Rep. Lionel Van Deerlin (D-CA), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications, discusses his views of the legislation known as the Communications Act of 1980 which his Committee is steering through the legislative process.",
