      "abstract": "The authors outline the science behind speech recognition technology and describe briefly the contributions of engineering, computer science, and mathematics to it. They discuss the state-of-the-art in both technique and performance, including some examples of successful applications. This is followed by a critical evaluation of the technology with respect to technical, commercial, and societal criteria. They conclude that even with today's suboptimum technology, there are types of applications in which useful deployment is possible and desirable but that those applications that will transform our society must wait until speech recognizers have nearly the capabilities of humans.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The use of adaptive equalization to increase storage density is discussed. Adaptive equalization is attractive since it permits a significant reduction in manufacturing costs by allowing a greater component yield due to relaxed tolerances and also permits a reduction in servicing costs because of a reduced need for fine-tuning on the customer's premises. The differences between data storage and data transmission channels are examined. The storage channel's important signal-processing characteristics are described, covering read and write processes, detection methods, and various types of distortion that can occur in storage channels. The use of signal-to-noise ratio as a performance measure is considered. Equalization methods for peak detection and for sampling detection are discussed. Gains in both linear and areal (track) density are addressed. Some of the basic performance advantages of using adaptive equalization are illustrated. The future of communication technology in storage systems is assessed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The objectives of network management control are outlined, and two categories of control are defined: network traffic controls and network configuration controls. Network traffic controls are further classified into traffic volume controls and routing controls, and advanced techniques for achieving each of them are examined. Two classes of methods for specifying the amount of traffic to be controlled are described. In proportional control, a certain proportion of the traffic offered by each exchange is admitted; in threshold control, there is a maximum rate at which the traffic offered by each exchange is admitted. The TCS-V2 traffic-control system, an advanced automatic code-blocking system that uses area and subscriber congestion control, is considered, and the simulated performance of proportional control and threshold control is compared for this system. For routing control, an advanced state-dependent dynamic routing scheme is examined, and the results of a comparative evaluation of dynamic routing schemes are presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The public carrier environment in which such networks must operate is described. Five categories of system management functional areas set forth in the ISO/IEC Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) standards are defined. They are fault management, accounting management, configuration management, performance management, and security management. The interoperability architecture provided by the standards is examined, and two example applications are given: a corporate banking voice network, and OSI-based configuration management applied to automatic call distribution.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

First, the introductory courses (calculus, physics, and chemistry), known as 'gatekeeper' courses because they turn students off, need to be avoided. Second, engineering should be taught up front in the freshman year, and the professional course that should be taught first is design. The design courses should take minimum use of calculus of physics; when such material is needed, it should be offered on a just-in-time basis.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The objectives and history of the NNI standardization are reviewed together with concepts, basic requirements, and features of the NNI. The nine-row-based frame structure and the virtual container (VC) concept, which are the main features of the NNI, are introduced. The multiplexing principle and method, the detailed frame structure and overhead, and mapping methods related to the NNI are described. Applications of the NNI in the synchronous network and international interworking are presented. The future application of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Developing measures to prevent communication interruptions caused by natural disasters, especially earthquakes, is a major priority of telecommunication service companies. Recent disaster damage in Japan is outlined, and preventive measures being taken by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) are described. NTT's design guidelines are based on three fundamental principles: improving network reliability, whereby facilities are physically reinforced and strengthened; preventing isolation, ensuring that communication with disaster-stricken districts is constant; and rapidly restoring services. Each of these principles and the methods used for their implementation are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

State-dependent routing and how some of the methodology also has bearing on the control issue are discussed. The problem of dimensioning a network that uses dynamic routing (i.e. how much capacity is needed and where it should be put to provide an acceptable performance) is addressed. A practical example, which refers to routing in an international access network, is discussed. Some conclusions are drawn on the benefits and drawbacks of distributed routing.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Five types of node that comprise the dynamic network O&amp;M system being developed by the authors are discussed. They are local exchanges, a centralized operation system, a database system, a diagnostics expert system, and maintenance workstations. The nodes are implemented on an efficient distributed system and use a standardized interface. This O&amp;M system, which is geared toward improved maintenance, focuses on the switching network as a whole, rather than on individual exchanges. In the case of alarms and fault messages, O&amp;M takes corrective action automatically.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The impact of the new SDH transmission equipment on the present plesiochronous network is assessed. The currently envisaged strategy for introducing SDH systems into the Italian transmission network is examined. Deploying SDH systems within large metropolitan areas, both at loop plant and urban junction levels, is discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The author introduces the SPRING and explains how its capacity advantage over other ring configurations enables it to be the most economical solution in more applications. Transport restoration technologies-1+1 diversity, digital crossconnect systems, and SPRINGS-in interoffice and interexchange environments are compared. A representative network study is presented to justify the choice of SPRINGs and matched nodes for the target architecture. Recommendations on how to evolve today's asynchronous networks in preparation for a fully survivable SONET ring-based network are also provided. Generic ring planning guidelines and network examples are presented to demonstrate how today's networks can be evolved to provide end-to-end survivable SONET transport. An approach to ring-based network design that simplifies the planning process and minimizes network cost is provided.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Examples of such applications are network telephony, ISDN terminals for audio teleconferencing, and systems for the storage of audio signals, which include the important subclass of wideband speech. Depending on the application, the bandwidth of input speech can vary from about 3 kHz to nearly 20 kHz. Coding for digital telephony at 4 and 8 kb/s, network quality coding at 16 kb/s, and coding for audio at 7 and 20 kHz are examined. Future directions in the field are discussed with respect to anticipated technology applications and the algorithms needed to support these technologies.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The state of South Carolina has been chosen, along with California, as a model state for development of the National Communications System/Telecommunications Services Priority (NCS/TSP) model plan for emergency restoration of telecommunications services. This effort is being undertaken in conjunction with the National Communications System Organization in Washington, DC. They are assisting the state in development of the telecommunications services priority (TSP) plan, to be used in the future for coordinating restoration of critical federal, state, and local telecommunication services. A private sector partnership has been initiated with the telecommunications and utility companies in South Carolina to provide fiber-optic alternate routing and other communications backup capability to each of the emergency preparedness offices in South Carolina counties in future disasters. An exchange of disaster recovery plans with other states has been undertaken. Information regarding each of these efforts is provided.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Four aspects of enterprise integration are described and discussed: an executive cockpit through which top executives can obtain timely, vital information about their business, wherever they are; concurrent engineering, with customer and supplier participation; interoffice interaction; and computer-integrated manufacturing, both intersite and intercompany. User requirements and the integrated services digital network (ISDN) technical solution(s) being developed in order to achieve these aspects of enterprise integration are examined.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The respective merits of SDH and asynchronous transport mode (ATM) technologies are examined, and a broad description of the present transmission network of France Telecom is given. Strategies for deploying SDH equipment such as synchronous transport module-N line systems, add-drop multiplexers, and administrative unit or virtual container crossconnect equipment in the network are described. The need for a smooth evolutionary path from the existing network is emphasized, as well as the prime importance of a synergy with telecommunications management network development to take full advantage of the potential management capabilities of SDH equipment. The possibility of early introduction of ATM to provide professional services such as local area network interconnection on a nationwide basis, without any constraint on or from the rate of evolution of the physical network, is considered.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The network and facilities of JCPenney Catalog Telemarketing, a provider of telemarketing services to the JCPenney Catalog Division and other JCPenney Divisions offering professional and comprehensive telemarketing services to the business community, are described. To ensure a fail-safe call handling environment, each of the 16 telemarketing centers (TMCs) is equipped with an automatic call distributor having built-in redundancy. All of the centers are equipped with an uninterruptible power supply system, battery backup, and power generators. Five regional JCPenney Data Centers support the telemarketing centers (an IBM Systems Network Architecture Network). A state of the network operations center (NOC) allows a single point of contact for the 16 telemarketing centers. The NOC staff can analyze all elements of the network and monitor and control the performance of network resources. Using hardware and software evaluation tools, they can identify and diagnose complex communication problems and other factors affecting services. Three examples are given to illustrate the operation of the network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The author suggests that as readily available technology is forcing changes in precollege mathematics education that have been long overdue, it is no longer obvious just what the 'basics' are. Furthermore, a shift in focus, from preparation exclusively for the hard sciences and engineering to preparation that includes combinatorics and the other discrete topics recommended and outlined in the NCTM's 'Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics' published in March 1989, has contributed to the confusion. She considers who the students are that high school teachers have tended to identify as the best math students and who the students are who have tended to go on into engineering, noting that they are not always the same people. She then considers changes in mathematics education in terms of student needs.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The characteristics of meteor burst communications are described and compared to those of HF and satellite systems. The two generic types of MB systems, broadcast and channel-probing systems, are explained. In systems using the broadcast protocol, the transmitter knows nothing about the occurrence of bursts or trails and transmits continuously for a sufficient duration to permit all recipients to receive the message/data with the desired probability. For practical purposes, the optimum burst or block duration for such systems is around 100-200 ms, based on the characteristics of the predominant trails. Channel-probing MB systems are more common and are commercially available in several versions. Here the transmitter repeatedly sends a short (typically 5-20 ms) probe signal until it receives a similarly short message response, indicating the availability of a suitable trail. A third, intermediate type of protocol with hybrid features does not probe the channel with a short signal, but starts repeatedly transmitting the first packet, in effect using it as a probe signal. Fundamental design issues and/or parameters of specific relevance to MB communication systems are discussed. Some historical and more recent MB systems are examined.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

An attempt is made to apply the method to an invented example. Several pitfalls that await the requirements specifier are discovered. One problem is that defining and classifying security services is not as straightforward as one would like. A more fundamental defect of the methodology is its rigid sequencing of specification followed by design followed by implementation. Moreover, it ignores the newer developments in the computing world, i.e. object-oriented programming and client-server computing.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The current state of telecommunications in Japan is briefly discussed, with particular reference to broadband services. Experience with the migration from the analog telephone network to the present narrowband integrated services digital networks (ISDN) is described. Three strategies for the transition from narrowband ISDN to broadband ISDN are examined. The market-driven strategy is to replace existing metallic subscriber loops with optical media, wherever possible, even if only narrowband services are required, with the expectation that these subscribers will eventually use broadband services. The service-oriented strategy entails putting into place a flexible and multipurpose platform that would also allow HDTV distribution and bidirectional communications. Early installation of such a platform would allow for the early announcement of broadband services, which would in turn stimulate demand. The benefits and drawbacks of each of these strategies are discussed. The advance-investment strategy is to press ahead with the introduction of optical subscriber loops to accelerate technological innovation, even if the cost is somewhat high. Other issues that are important to the migration of broadband ISDN are noted.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The development of a network management strategy and a network control system for the large integrated telecommunications network (ITN) at American Express Travel Related Services Company is discussed. Network control relates to operational activities such as the diagnostics, configuration, monitoring, and performance of networks, and network management relates to all of the functions performed to manage network resources. An architecture that addresses both control and management requirements is described. Network control functions are consolidated so that operations have a single interface to the system and can operate dissimilar systems from a single workstation. NETVIEW, a licensed IBM software, performs the functions of a focal point, and the network element management system (NEMS) addresses the management of network elements. The centralization of alarms and/or alerts and issuance of commands provides immediate capability to monitor and resolve network problems through a single set of terminals as well as a platform for further automation through the use of artificial intelligence technology.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In addition to 64-kb/s access to Transpac, the national packet-switching public data network (PSPDN), it has been decided to offer packet-mode data communications services on the D channel of the user access to provide access to switching facilities as well as other applications and services such as telex, videotex, or teleactions through so-called access points. Layer-2 frame-switching capabilities are being developed for this purpose in Alcatel E10 switching systems to operate permanent logical links (PLLs) in a first stage, to be complemented by switched logical links at a second stage. The implementation of the switched access to a PSPDN gateway known as the packet access point (PAP) in Transpac is reviewed, and a description is given of the network equipment and interfaces being implemented in the E10 switching system to support the PLL services in conformance with CCITT Recommendation X.31 (maximum integration on the D channel, without incoming call notification).&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The technical alternatives for routing techniques and their integration with congestion and flow control are considered. The performance of dynamically controlled networks is analyzed in the framework of research done at the Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET) together with studies carried out in other research laboratories. Comparisons are made of dynamic routing versus fixed hierarchical routing and time-dependent routing versus adaptive routing. For adaptive routing, centralized and isolated methods are compared. The benefits of advanced control methods are summarized.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Specific submodels for the higher-level functional blocks, such as the message transfer part (MTP) level 3, the signaling connection control part (SCCP), the ISDN user part (ISDN-UP), and the transaction capabilities application part (TCAP), are given in a generic way, explicitly. With these submodels, generic models for signaling points and signaling transfer points are constructed. The major functional parts of the layered protocol architecture of SS7 are modeled in a generic way by extended queuing network elements such as full duplex flow controlled links, priority processors, multiple-chain multiple-class traffic streams, or elements for segmenting and reassembling of messages. The analysis of the whole network starts from a global traffic flow analysis, which takes all the different signaling message types, their paths through the network, and the load into account. The overall performance measures, such as end-to-end transfer times, are found from all the component delays. The analytical results have been validated by simulation, revealing a high degree of accuracy.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The latter include active reconfigurable fabrics based on TDM, time-slot interchangers, and universal time slots, in addition to passive shared media fabrics. Some of the switching fabrics that have been proposed using wavelength channels are outlined, and multidimensional fabrics are briefly reviewed. Photonic switching fabrics based on free-space devices are described, covering free-space relational switching fabrics, the basic hardware required for digital free-space optical fabrics, and digital free-space switching fabrics.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is argued that we have somehow nurtured the idea that there is a science elite, small in number, highly intelligent, hard working, and not all that much fun to be around. The roots of this perception are identified, and proposals are made for altering the situation. A major factor is believed to be the nature of achievement tests, which put a premium on quick recall and giving up if the answer is not immediately known, as opposed to curiosity and perseverance.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Experimentation with screen-based telephony is discussed in the framework of Apple Computer's user-centered design philosophy. The approach described enables programs to be developed for the most ubiquitous technologies today-plain old telephone service (POTS) and proprietary private branch exchanges (PBXs)-but also allows for an easy, logical upgrade to future technologies like ISDN. The model has been built in three layers, which reflect the three constituencies who must cooperate to bring ISDN applications (and their forerunners) to market, in the volume required to spark the growth of this area: telecommunications vendors, personal computer vendors, and independent software developers. The Call Manager Application Programmers Interface is the code/specification from Apple that enables voice and data applications to be written independently of the vendor or technology. Telecommunications vendors can write drivers to the Application Program Interface (API) and build the appropriate hardware interfaces, without having to support thousands of software developers. Some of the features of Apple's prototype human interface to the voice network on this API are described.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Its history is briefly reviewed, and the SS7 network services part (NSP), which corresponds to the first three layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model, is described. Signaling network structures that, in conjunction with the NSP, provide integrated services digital network (ISDN) nodes with a highly reliable and efficient means of exchanging signaling messages are discussed. The nodal capabilities of connection (call) control and remote process invocation and management and other functions of the user parts of SS7 are examined. The very stringent performance requirements of signaling systems, which reflect the critical nature of signaling functions and their real-time exigencies, are stressed. A broad outline of the likely evolution of ISDN signaling systems in the remaining years of this century is sketched.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Three major steps in this context are to expand fiber networks into the subscriber loop area to provide broadband capabilities everywhere, to construct a universal digital network that facilitates smooth evolution from the existing network to the broadband network of the future through deployment of (SDH) synchronous digital hierarchy transmission systems, and to integrate both services and network components through introduction of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technologies. Development efforts now being carried out at Fujitsu and Fujitsu Laboratories along this line are described, and the impact on network construction and service offerings is indicated.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He then describes the humanities and social sciences and shows how they evolved fairly recently from philosophy. He discusses the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the education of engineers, to the engineering profession, and to the quality of life of individuals and society. Finally, he describes how the humanities and social science requirements are structured in most engineering curricula and makes recommendations for improvement.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "An overview of standards related to CCITT (International Consultative Committee for Telephone and Telegraph) message handling systems (MHS) is presented. The standards are concerned with communications between users of different electronic mail systems. At a gateway between systems, a user message is first transformed into a message protocol data unit (MPDU); the MPDU is transformed into session protocol data units (SPDUs); each SPDU is further transformed into transport protocol data units (TPDUs); and, finally, a TPDU is transformed into an X.25 data packet. One of the key factors affecting the performance of an MHS gateway is the number of X.25 data packets generated by a user message. The problem of MPDU size estimation is treated, and the calculation of the number of X.25 data packets based on a given MPDU size is described. An example is provided to illustrate the procedure. As an additional result, the optimal size for data synchronization between two consecutive minor synchronization points is established.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

A communications architecture is introduced and used to organize the discussion of the ISDN protocols (i.e. DSS1 and SS7) and to highlight the role of signaling in the overall architecture. The architecture defines a functional partitioning of the capabilities of ISDN, which is used to compare and contrast the DSS1 and SS7 protocols and to discuss the interfaces that support global intelligent networks. The purpose is to illustrate the similarity between the DSS1 and SS7 control protocols. The likely evolution of the ISDN protocols is discussed, showing their convergence toward a single control protocol based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) protocols.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

These include achievements in radio telemetry with regard to distance, the spacecraft hardware, and the earth-based part of the system. Innovative coding techniques provided extremely low bit error probabilities. In navigation, the Neptune encounter was supported by the longest-distance ranging ever, Doppler, and the first operational use of delta very-long baseline interferometry. The Voyager mission was the first specifically designed to obtain radio-science data, by having very exacting requirements for radio system stability, both at S- and X-bands, and for frequency and timing system stability, both flight and ground.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

She addresses the mathematics curriculum of kindergarten through 12th grade and identifies factors working against students doing mathematics. She maintains that the typical elementary curriculum is filled with an inordinate amount of arithmetic review with a single goal, the mastery of multidigit computation-rather than the mastery of conceptualization. She suggests that changes in instructional strategy, placement and pacing of new content in the curriculum, and the level of expectations may help to improve achievement.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
