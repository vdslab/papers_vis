In this article we discuss the principles, key advantages, and most recent demonstrations of a record 100 Gb/s OFDM-based PON as a future PON candidate architecture. Moreover, we provide an analysis of primary cost factors in a practical DSP-based OFDMA-PON implementation and survey the most recent achievements in this domain. Due to the combination of highly attractive advanced features and favorable related trends in longhaul 100 Gb/s fiber transmission, OFDMA-PON can be regarded as a very promising solution for future PON-based access.",

      "abstract": "The combination of digital media, personal computing, and global networking is creating a radical shift in the telecom industry. However, the transport backbone, which was built on 10G wavelengths, is nearing capacity and is driving the need for upgrades to 40G and 100G. 100G Ethernet and OTU4 bring new fundamental concepts, which require new training and new testing. 100G Ethernet and OTU4 equipment is currently in development or in trial, and the next phase is to deploy this equipment in the field. This article is mostly based on the work done by IEEE P802.3ba and ITU-T Study Group 15 to provide an overview of how 100G Ethernet and OTU4 are different from previous technologies, and includes guidance on which tests need to be performed with these emerging technologies. 112G line side testing is also briefly discussed.",

      "abstract": "Optical packet switching has been considered a prominent paradigm for future WDM networks to efficiently support a multitude of applications with diverse quality of service requirements. In this article we present the architectural design and experimental demonstration of a 10 Gb/s QoS optical packet switching system (QOPSS) for WDM networks. It embodies a set of many-to-one space switches, each of which handles the switching solely for a cluster of wavelengths. With the cluster-based optical switch design, QOPSS trades off limited statistical multiplexing gains for higher system scalability. By many-to-one, multiple packets that are carried by different internal wavelengths are scheduled to switch to the same output port but receive different delays afterward. QOPSS adopts downsized feed-forward optical buffers, yielding drastic reduction in packet loss probability in an economical manner. Significantly, through using four-wave-mixing wavelength converters at the output section, QOPSS permits optical packet preemption, thus achieving effectual QoS differentiation. The article presents both simulation and experimental testbed results to demonstrate the feasibility and superior packet loss/QoS performance of the system.",

The entities may even reside in domains where different technologies are used. This article presents a case study on the design and implementation of a novel lookup service for the dynamic discovery of entities across technologies and domains. This novel service allows end users to dynamically discover entities that meet specific constraints (e.g., interests or abilities, availability at a specific time or location, and/or affiliation(s)). It is a powerful enabler that may be used as a pillar for a wide range of other end-user services. The proposed architecture relies on presence service and RESTful Web services. The related security aspects are studied. A proof-of-concept prototype is built and its performance is evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The performance of wireless networks depends critically on their spatial configuration, because received signal power and interference depend critically on the distances between numerous transmitters and receivers. This is particularly true in emerging network paradigms that may include femtocells, hotspots, relays, white space harvesters, and meshing approaches, which are often overlaid with traditional cellular networks. These heterogeneous approaches to providing high-capacity network access are characterized by randomly located nodes, irregularly deployed infrastructure, and uncertain spatial configurations due to factors like mobility and unplanned user-installed access points. This major shift is just beginning, and it requires new design approaches that are robust to spatial randomness, just as wireless links have long been designed to be robust to fading. The objective of this article is to illustrate the power of spatial models and analytical techniques in the design of wireless networks, and to provide an entry-level tutorial.",

      "abstract": "In recent years the power grid has been undergoing transformative changes due to the greater penetration of renewable energy sources and increased focus on power demand shaping. These innovative transformations on the grid require a flexible IP-based communication grid that is reliable and secure. In this article we describe an IPbased decentralized and data-centric information infrastructure that can reliably, securely, and cost-effectively support the operation and innovative applications of the next generation grid. The proposed infrastructure differs from a typical distributed system since it addresses the specific requirements of power applications such as security, distributed data sources, latency sensitive data transactions and real time event updates. The work presented here paves the way for a future data-centric power network infrastructure.",

Application delivery channels such as the Apple AppStore are transforming mobile phones into App Phones, capable of downloading a myriad of applications in an instant. Importantly, today's smartphones are programmable and come with a growing set of cheap powerful embedded sensors, such as an accelerometer, digital compass, gyroscope, GPS, microphone, and camera, which are enabling the emergence of personal, group, and communityscale sensing applications. We believe that sensor-equipped mobile phones will revolutionize many sectors of our economy, including business, healthcare, social networks, environmental monitoring, and transportation. In this article we survey existing mobile phone sensing algorithms, applications, and systems. We discuss the emerging sensing paradigms, and formulate an architectural framework for discussing a number of the open issues and challenges emerging in the new area of mobile phone sensing research.",

These grids involve communication networks, and their links are essential resources for massive data transfers. However, the management of current grid systems requires intervention for efficient service provisioning. Moreover, this need increases with the increase in demand for grid services. Therefore, grid systems will become effective only when they are capable of self-managing resource allocation to cope with fluctuations in resource availability. At present, however, very few integrated self-adaptive mechanisms have been implemented in existing grid systems. The aim of this article is to provide a survey of existing mechanisms and suggest directions for enabling autonomic operation of grid systems.",

      "abstract": "Disaster situation management involves managing information and resources to tackle time varying situations surrounding a geo-spatial region of interest. Post disaster, relief and recovery operations are handled in a distributed self-configuring manner and involve a diverse array of resources and participants. Although in-situ planning is the only option, disaster situation management should consider system requirements, processes and interdependencies to make the process effective. Having a higher level view of the system, its requirements and the evolving situations warrant the need for accurate models; models that are able to predict, forecast and deal with the logistical, technical, operational, and financial challenges. We propose a system of systems approach to situation modeling to represent the causal relationships between resources, functional assets and different stages in the infrastructure renewal process. Generic interactions at the situation and system level have been defined and theory is developed for the use of fuzzy graphical models. A genetic algorithms based technique has been developed to determine optimal structure and parameters of the graphical model. Real world data from a post earthquake reconstruction process is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, the avoidance of interference is still an issue that needs to be addressed to successfully deploy a femtocell tier over existing macrocell networks. Moreover, interference is strongly dependent on the type of access control, which decides if a given user can or cannot connect to the femtocell. In this article the existing access methods for femtocells together with their benefits and drawbacks are explained. A description of the business model and technical impact of access methods in femto/macro networks is also provided. Finally, the need for hybrid access methods and several models are presented.",

      "abstract": "Link adaptation is a way to increase data rates in wireless systems by adapting transmission parameters such as the modulation and coding rate. While link adaptation in single antenna systems is now mature, its application to multiple-input multiple-output communication links, presented in several emerging wireless standards, has been challenging. The main reason is that the space-time transmission strategy can also be adjusted in MIMO communication links, introducing a new dimension for adaptation. This means that practical MIMO link adaptation algorithms must also provide a dynamic adaptation between diversity and multiplexing modes of operation. This article reviews a recently proposed framework for adaptive MIMO architectures and shows how to use this framework to reduce adaptive control overhead. We also discuss practical implementation issues. Simulations in an IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX) system illustrate the frame-work's potential improvements in data rates.",

In the design of IMT-Advanced systems, the scalability and flexibility to support various 4G deployments is also very crucial while meeting the latency requirement on handover. This article presents the state-of-the-art handover schemes considering various deployment scenarios in IMTAdvanced candidate systems with a focus on IEEE 802.16m1 based next-generation WiMAX networks and 3GPP LTE-Advanced.2 Also, to minimize and optimize handover latency to fulfill the requirement for quality of service during handover, various procedural advanced handover schemes are being developed, proposed, and analyzed by IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP. Handover schemes in IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP provide lower link layer handover latency while providing the required QoS level than the existing link layer handover schemes.",

This article presents the state-of-the-art power management methods in next-generation wireless networks with a focus on IEEE 802.16m based next-generation WiMAX networks and 3GPP LTE. To minimize and optimize user equipment power consumption, and further to support various services and large amounts of data transmissions, advanced power conservation mechanisms are being developed in IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP. Two advanced power conservation mechanisms, sleep and idle modes, which are enhanced versions of the legacy IEEE 802.16 system's sleep and idle modes, were proposed and adopted in IEEE 802.16m. Similarly, 3GPP LTE adopts a discontinuous reception mechanism for power conservation in RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE states. Power management techniques in WiMAX and 3GPP LTE provide less control signaling and operational overhead while providing more efficient power saving, and use simpler operation procedures than the existing power management techniques.",

To contribute to ITU-T's initiative, we first propose a naming system to configure host-names and identifiers and map them to locators. We then propose a network architecture that is based on the ID/locator split concept and the naming system. The proposed architecture allows the network layer to change protocols and locators without disturbing the upper-layer communication sessions. This capability is helpful for designing efficient solutions for mobility, multi-homing, routing, and security as well as for integrating heterogeneous network layer protocols.",

In particular, a fiber channel arbitration loop-based network among PVRs has been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of high-quality content sharing. In addition, a multiple-loop architecture with shared disks, instead of expensive FC switches, has been devised in order to overcome the limit on the number of accommodable PVR users. Nevertheless, there arises the need for a practically constructible topology solution since the multiple-loop architecture is based on complete graph topology that requires the most connectivity for configuration. Therefore, we propose an innovative minimum spanning tree-based graph topology for multiple-loop topology organization. The MSG-based multiple-loop architecture can determine the constant average loop size and constant reject ratio, regardless of the number of deployed loops, and the acceptable total traffic with much less connectivity than CG, thereby effectively supporting high-quality live content sharing and distribution between PVRs.",

The dual tuner down-converts a total of ten 6 MHz Annex B channels or eight 8 MHz Annex A channels, for a maximum data rate of 320 Mb/s in Annex B and 400 Mb/s in Annex A mode. The dual tuner exceeds all the stringent SCTE 40 specifications over the 48-1004 MHz bandwidth, without using any external components or SAW filters. Enabling technologies are a harmonic rejection front-end, a low-noise high-frequency resolution PLL, and digital image rejection. To our knowledge this is the first reported multichannel broadband tuner embedded in a DOCSIS 3.0 System on a chip implemented in 65 nm pure digital CMOS technology.",

The methodology has been developed and implemented into a tool that calculates end-user downtime and failure rate from DoS frequency data and design attributes such as security feature coverage. The application of security vulnerability modeling during design enables designers to evaluate design options and quantify the outage risks for different design strategies. The optimum design can be selected, and verification and operational action plans can be determined.",

      "abstract": "Compressive sensing is a topic that has recently gained much attention in the applied mathematics and signal processing communities. It has been applied in various areas, such as imaging, radar, speech recognition, and data acquisition. In communications, compressive sensing is largely accepted for sparse channel estimation and its variants. In this article we highlight the fundamental concepts of compressive sensing and give an overview of its application to pilot aided channel estimation. We point out that a popular assumption - that multipath channels are sparse in their equivalent baseband representation - has pitfalls. There are over-complete dictionaries that lead to much sparser channel representations and better estimation performance. As a concrete example, we detail the application of compressive sensing to multicarrier underwater acoustic communications, where the channel features sparse arrivals, each characterized by its distinct delay and Doppler scale factor. To work with practical systems, several modifications need to be made to the compressive sensing framework as the channel estimation error varies with how detailed the channel is modeled, and how data and pilot symbols are mixed in the signal design.",

However, the industry is still seeking an ideal application programming interface design to publish telecommunication functions with web service technology. The industry is also unsure whether supplying not only APIs but SDKs is really necessary, even though there is a vague consensus that SDKs enable programmers to create novel web-telecom applications. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative experiment with human participants to investigate the productivity of web-telecom application programming with Parlay X and an SDK. From the results, we discuss the inevitable problem that web-telecom APIs and SDKs, in handling stateful and asynchronous communication with web service technologies, confuse programmers.",

To take the full benefit of this protocol and exploit all its features, the future Internet needs to gracefully couple it with autonomics. In this article we demonstrate through our experience with network renumbering how the coupling of both IPv6 core functionality extended with major functions of the autonomic world can lead to fully autonomous activities of main management functions. We instantiate the notions of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-protection, and self-healing in the network renumbering process and show how all together they can make renumbering a real success. We illustrate the various functions with the tools we have implemented to support them.",

Findings in this field have fostered new developments in networking, especially in the most challenging domains such as handling large-scale networks, their dynamic nature, resource constraints, heterogeneity, unattended operation, and robustness. Even though this new research area started with highly theoretical concepts, it can be seen that there is also practical impact. This article aims to give an overview to the general field of bioinspired networking, introducing the key concepts and methodologies. Selected examples that outline the capabilities and the practical relevance are discussed in more detail. The presented examples outline the activities of a new community working on bio-inspired networking solutions, which is converging and becomes visible in term of the provided astonishingly efficient solutions.",

In severely resource-constrained systems such as WBANs, energy can usually be traded for packet delay, loss, and system throughput, whenever applicable. Using experimental results from a prototype wearable sensor network, the article first characterizes the dynamic nature of on-body links with varying body postures. A literature review follows to examine the relevant transmission power control mechanisms for ensuring a balance between energy consumption and packet loss on links between body-mounted sensors. Specific emphasis is put on approaches that are customized for TPC via tracking of postural node mobility. Then the article develops a WBAN-specific dynamic power control mechanism that performs adaptive body posture inference for optimal power assignments. Finally, performance of the mechanism is experimentally evaluated and compared with a number of static and dynamic power assignment schemes.",

      "abstract": "By some measures, access to electronic media in rural areas of the United States is on par with the rest of the nation. Statewide data for Montana regarding high-speed Internet penetration is comparable to the national penetration level, and Montana's citizens have other means of information access including wireless hot spots, schools and libraries equipped with Internet and municipal websites. However, statewide averages are misleading. The data presented here are specific to Montana and the United States, but the challenges are global, and the investigation and conclusions should be of general interest to those engaged in designing telecommunications infrastructure and delivering services. A more careful examination of the data, using countywide and local information where available, reveals several significant patterns and gaps. Montana's more metropolitan areas are experiencing significant population and economic growth, and much of the growth in information access and online services is centered in these areas. The rural and remote regions of the state are underserved and falling behind. Online services in Montana are uneven. While about two thirds of the counties have websites, the local services offered in the rural areas are not comparable to those available in the metro areas, and well behind national levels. Services that would offer alternatives to costly travel, such as streaming video, document retrieval, filings, and registrations are available in Montana on an extremely limited basis. With energy and travel costs rising, expanded e-government services could be a valuable investment. Policy changes and strategies to stimulate infrastructure investments, following a more in-depth examination of coverage and service inequities, could have a significant impact on closing the gaps.",

It proposes a simple model of its growth and identifies the theoretical growth limits in each country. Some aspects of the European i2010 project implementation are presented, discussed, and compared with the model. Comments on bottlenecks and major barriers in the broadband Internet diffusion process are also offered. The existing digital gaps are irreducible in some cases and will exist as long as the current development conditions continue. The approach and analysis method proposed here may be useful in examining limits of other services or in other regions during the planning, design, implementation, and performance tracking stages of existing or new services.",

      "abstract": "Recent developments in nanoscale electronics allow current wireless technologies to function in nanoscale environments. Especially due to their incredible electrical and electromagnetic properties, carbon nanotubes are promising physical phenomenon that are used for the realization of a nanoscale communication paradigm. This provides a very large set of new promising applications such as collaborative disease detection with communicating in-vivo nanosensor nodes and distributed chemical attack detection with a network of nanorobots. Hence, one of the most challenging subjects for such applications becomes the realization of nanoscale ad hoc networks. In this article, we define the concept of carbon nanotube-based nanoscale ad hoc networks for future nanotechnology applications. Carbon nanotube-based nanoscale Ad hoc NETworks (CANETs) can be perceived as the down-scaled version of traditional wireless ad hoc networks without downgrading its main functionalities. The objective of this work is to introduce this novel and interdisciplinary research field and highlight major barriers toward its realization.",

This article first gives a brief review of continuous and non-continuous CA techniques, followed by two data aggregation schemes in physical and medium access control layers. Some technical challenges for implementing CA technique in LTE-Advanced systems, with the requirements of backward compatibility to LTE systems, are highlighted and discussed. Possible technical solutions for the asymmetric CA problem, control signaling design, handover control, and guard band setting are reviewed. Simulation results show Doppler frequency shift has only limited impact on data transmission performance over wide frequency bands in a high-speed mobile environment when the component carriers are time synchronized. The frequency aliasing will generate much more interference between adjacent component carriers and therefore greatly degrades the bit error rate performance of downlink data transmissions.",

This feature allows scalable expansion of effective bandwidth delivered to a user terminal through concurrent utilization of radio resources across multiple carriers. These carriers may be of different bandwidths, and may be in the same or different bands to provide maximum flexibility in utilizing the scarce radio spectrum available to operators. Support for this feature requires enhancement to the LTE Release 8/9 PHY, MAC, and RRC layers while ensuring that LTE Release 10 maintains backward compatibility to LTE Release 8/9.

Mobile network operators are upgrading their networks to deliver growing packet traffic cost effectively, while maintaining critical operational functions such as base station synchronization and resilience to faults. Carrier Ethernet technology is figuring strongly in the upgrade from the existing TDM mobile backhaul between radio base stations and mobile core networks.",

      "abstract": "Cell size in cellular networks is in general fixed based on the estimated traffic load. However, the traffic load can have significant spatial and temporal fluctuations, which bring both challenges and opportunities to the planning and operating of cellular networks. This article introduces a concept of cell zooming, which adaptively adjusts the cell size according to traffic load, user requirements and channel conditions. The implementation issues of cell zooming are then presented. Finally a usage case of cell zooming for energy saving is investigated. Centralized and distributed cell zooming algorithms are developed, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can greatly reduce the energy consumption, which leads to green cellular networks.",

      "abstract": "Mobile communications are increasingly contributing to global energy consumption. In this article, a holistic approach for energy efficient mobile radio networks is presented. The matter of having appropriate metrics and evaluation methods that allow assessing the energy efficiency of the entire system is discussed. The mutual supplementary saving concepts comprise component, link and network levels. At the component level the power amplifier complemented by a transceiver and a digital platform supporting advanced power management are key to efficient radio implementations. Discontinuous transmission by base stations, where hardware components are switched off, facilitate energy efficient operation at the link level. At the network level, the potential for reducing energy consumption is in the layout of networks and their management, that take into account slowly changing daily load patterns, as well as highly dynamic traffic fluctuations. Moreover, research has to analyze new disruptive architectural approaches, including multi-hop transmission, ad-hoc meshed networks, terminal-to-terminal communications, and cooperative multipoint architectures.",

      "abstract": "Channel management policy is one of the key functions of any cognitive radio system. The channel management decision in a cognitive radio system depends on various factors such as government regulations, limitations of transmission power between communicating devices, availability of geo-location information, and the quality of various available channels. The main purpose of channel management in a cognitive radio system is to protect the incumbent users (licensed users). The first international standard based on cognitive radio technology is IEEE 802.22, Wireless Regional Area Networks, which aims at providing broadband access in rural areas by effectively utilizing the unused TV channels. This standard aims at describing both PHY and MAC layer functionalities in an infrastructure- based broadband wireless access network for communication between consumer premises equipment using a base station. This article presents the cognitive radio functionality of this standard in detail. The cognitive functionality is provided by the dynamic channel management using channel sensing, channel classification, and maintenance of channel information. Using these techniques, this standard effectively protects the incumbent users and dynamically manages the channel allocation in IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems.",

      "abstract": "Unlike commercial MANET applications, tactical networks are typically hierarchical and involve heterogeneous types of radio communications. Future tactical networks also require cognitive functions across the protocol stack to exploit scarce spectrum and dynamically adapt functions and configuration settings. In this work we highlight the need for novel design tools for cognitive tactical networks. We define a system design model that will provide the foundation for generic network design problem formulations via the use of cognitive techniques covering both dynamic frequency adaptations and machinelearning- related aspects of cognition. We use the system model to identify several potential cognitive design knobs and describe how the different design knobs can potentially be adjusted at different timescales of operation. These knobs are used in formulating a cognitive network design problem. Finally, we discuss how a network designer can potentially benefit from the proposed model result, a cognitive network design toolset we have recently developed.",

      "abstract": "The development of 100 Gb/s transponder technology is progressing rapidly to meet the needs of next-generation optical/IP carrier networks. Video-driven IP traffic growth continues together with the need for ever higher-speed ports on IP routers, Ethernet switches, and OTN cross-connects, thus driving the requirements for cost-effective client and line side 100 Gb/s transponders. For a short time to market, 100 Gb/s transponders should be deployable using 10 Gb/s link-engineering rules over existing fiber and DWDM infrastructure. In this article we describe the upgrade of an installed 10 Gb/s field system to 100 Gb/s using a real-time single carrier coherent 100G polarization multiplexed quadrature phase shift keyed (PM-QPSK) channel. Performance sufficient for error-free operation after forward error correction was achieved over installed 900 km and 1800 km links, proving the viability of 100 Gb/s upgrades to most installed systems. Excellent tolerance to fiber polarization mode dispersion and narrowband optical filtering demonstrates the applicability of this technology over the majority of installed fiber plant and through existing 50 GHz reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers.",

      "abstract": "As noted last month, ComSoc has found that wireless practitioners bring a wide range of backgrounds to the certification exam, in both their education and experience. Therefore, what were originally eligibility requirements have been changed to eligibility recommendations. Although it is now up to each individual to decide whether he or she is adequately prepared for the exam, prospective applicants should recognize that thorough preparation, comprising both training and on-the-job experience, is important for success in the exam. As noted in the 2011 issue of the Candidate's Handbook, \"Applicants with a combination of a bachelor's degree or comparable education plus three or more years of professional experience - or other similar level of preparation - have been more successful on the examination than those with less preparation.\"",

The study proves femtocell users can expect to observe an improvement of more than five times in average airlink data speeds relative to the existing macrocell network. The article presents the methodology used in the tests, and offers summary results for both 1xEV-DO and HSDPA technologies. The results presented here show that the case for using femtocells for broadband data services is even stronger than for voice-based services.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative multiple-input multiple-output technology allows a wireless network to coordinate among distributed antennas and achieve considerable performance gains similar to those provided by conventional MIMO systems. It promises significant improvements in spectral efficiency and network coverage and is a major candidate technology in various standard proposals for the fourth-generation wireless communication systems. For the design and accurate performance assessment of cooperative MIMO systems, realistic cooperative MIMO channel models are indispensable. This article provides an overview of the state of the art in cooperative MIMO channel modeling. We show that although the existing standardized point-to-point MIMO channel models can be applied to a certain extent to model cooperative MIMO channels, many new challenges remain in cooperative MIMO channel modeling, such as how to model mobile-to-mobile channels, and how to characterize the heterogeneity and correlation of multiple links at the system level appropriately.",

      "abstract": "Fiber to the home is the future-proof technology for broadband access networks. Several fiber access network architectures have been developed (e.g., point-to-point, active optical network, and passive optical network). PON is considered the most promising solution due to the relatively low deployment cost and high resource efficiency. Meanwhile, because of the growing demand for reliable service delivery, fault management is becoming more significant in all parts of communications networks. However, there is a trade-off between the cost of protection and the level of service reliability. Since economical aspects are most critical in the access part of networks, improving reliability performance by duplication of network resources (and capital expenditures) could be too expensive. Therefore, recent work has focused on PON protection schemes with reduced CAPEX. The future trend will probably migrate toward minimizing operational expenditures during the access network lifetime. The main contributions of this article include providing a general method for CAPEX and OPEX analysis that can be applied to any type of fiber access network with consideration of changed component cost in time and variable take rates, and comparing the total cost (i.e., sum of CAPEX and OPEX) for the selected representative architectures with and without protection for business and residential users in relation to reliability performance. The aim is to give a guideline for the design of the most cost-effective protection schemes, while maintaining acceptable service reliability.",

In this article we develop an experimental network called Terabits Optical Network Integrated Computing Environment and design a joint resources scheduling system for resource management, task scheduling, and application execution. Two resource scheduling schemes, overlay scheduling and integrated scheduling, are proposed and studied. Live demonstrations and performance evaluations are conducted on the TONICE experimental network. The experimental result shows the feasibility of JRSS for real deployment. In addition, the integrated resource scheduling scheme not only reduces the execution time, but also improves the resource efficiency for distributed scientific applications.",

      "abstract": "Deployment of contextual services is usually constrained to specific areas where contextual behavior can be obtained, mainly due to coverage limitations of context acquisition devices. Although end customers highly appreciate contextual services, those limitations make such services difficult to commercialize. In this article we present a practical deployment of a contextual service offered by a convergent telecommunications operator, whose functionality is to provide intelligent context-based call routing and rerouting, orchestrated from the operator's service layer. It is based on IMS control layer capabilities to properly capture the situation of the end user in a ubiquitous coverage area. The user's context is stored in a network-centric element in order to leverage that information across different services, optimizing the system by increasing the quality of the information captured and processed. This implementation proves that value-added contextual services may be built efficiently today using available products and protocols. Since contextual services will likely be a valuable part of a service provider's portfolio, this implementation can help creators of new contextual services to meet cost and time-to-market objectives.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communication technology is constantly advancing with the primary objective being to improve the quality of service for the end user. Cognitive radio is a technology capable of advancing wireless communications to the next generation of intelligent devices. Integrating cognition into wireless applications such as dynamic spectrum access, radio resource management, wireless distributed computing, and even traditional protocol stacks has already been shown to provide benefits related to the communications quality of service. The majority of cognitive radio related research has been limited to theoretical frameworks and simulations or in a few cases, demonstrating prototype DSA devices on a small scale. In order to continue advancing in this area, larger-scale experiments that are reproducible and able to be moved beyond theoretical simulations are required. Virginia Tech has built a testbed for software-defined and cognitive radio related research for the purpose of rapid next-generation communication system prototyping using a medium scale size network of flexible wireless nodes. In this article we present the details of the development, design decision rationale, and deployment of this testbed in hopes that it will be both used by the research community, and duplicated and improved in order to further the development of the many different facets of cognitive radio research.",

As the growth of fixed and mobile networks relies on private investment and sufficient regulatory and economic incentives, competition in different telecommunications markets will increasingly depend on providers' ability to differentiate their product and discriminate among consumers. Unless the industry - operators, content providers, and regulatory and competition authorities - fully understands and exploits the welfare enhancing role of discrimination in the new environment, NGNs' promises of universal and ubiquitous access, sustainability, and affordability might be only incipiently achieved.",

      "abstract": "The rigid nature of current wavelength-routed optical networks brings limitations on network utilization efficiency. One limitation originates from mismatch of granularities between the client layer and the wavelength layer. The recently proposed spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE) is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. This article discusses another limitation of the current optical networks associated with worst case design in terms of transmission performance. In order to address this problem, we present a concept of a novel adaptation scheme in SLICE called distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation. In the presented scheme the minimum necessary spectral resource is adaptively allocated according to the end-to-end physical condition of an optical path. Modulation format and optical filter width are used as parameters to determine the necessary spectral resources to be allocated for an optical path. Evaluation of network utilization efficiency shows that distance-adaptive SLICE can save more than 45 percent of required spectrum resources for a 12-node ring network. Finally, we introduce the concept of a frequency slot to extend the current frequency grid standard, and discuss possible spectral resource designation schemes.",

To meet these needs, we present DistressNet, an ad hoc wireless architecture that supports disaster response with distributed collaborative sensing, topology-aware routing using a multichannel protocol, and accurate resource localization. Sensing suites use collaborative and distributed mechanisms to optimize data collection and minimize total energy use. Message delivery is aided by novel topology management, while congestion is minimized through the use of mediated multichannel radio protocols. Estimation techniques improve localization accuracy in difficult environments.",

      "abstract": "Networking research often relies on synthetic traffic generation in its experimental activities; from generation of realistic workload to active measurements. Often researchers adopt software-based generators because of their flexibility. However, despite the increasing number of features (e.g., replication of complex traffic models), they are still suffering problems that can undermine the correctness of experiments: what is generated is sometimes far from what is requested by the operator. In this article, by analyzing four of the most used packet-level traffic generators in literature, we show how they fail to follow the requested profiles. Moreover, we identify and discuss key concepts affecting their accuracy as well as mechanisms commonly adopted to improve it. This contribution goes toward improving the knowledge researchers and practitioners should have of the tools used in experimental works, and at the same time illustrates some directions for the use and design of software-based traffic generators.",

      "abstract": "Social Networks are one of the latest revolutions in networking, allowing users with common interests to stay connected and exchange information. They have enjoyed great success not only for traditional Internet users, but also for mobile users. Recent efforts are also being done to make social networks available within vehicles. However, to exploit social networks at their full potential in a vehicular context a number of technical challenges and design issues need to be faced. In this article, we analyze those challenges and present an innovative solution for providing Social services on the vehicle based on IP Multimedia Subsystem and Machine to Machine capabilities. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme we present a social network service called Drive and Share which offers relevant information to vehicles using our proposed architecture.",

      "abstract": "A passive optical network, with its inherent point to multi-point structure, allows for centralized placement of active equipment and possible extension of its boundary towards core networks. This property of the PON can be exploited for node consolidation where multiple central offices are replaced by a single one covering a larger service area. Such node consolidation is being particularly driven by the need for network operational cost saving, and is offering significant challenges to PONs. The degree of node consolidation that can be achieved is limited by the reach of conventional PON systems. In order to achieve a larger degree of node consolidation, an extension of the PON reach, beyond the conventional 20 km, is required. This article addresses the challenges of the dynamic bandwidth allocation, where increased reach results in a degradation of DBA performance and quality of service support. This degradation is a consequence of the increased propagation delay of the DBA messages exchanged between different PON elements. A potential solution to the performance degradation is the introduction of a multi-threaded DBA. In this article, we examine for both Gigabit PON and Ethernet PON, the extent to which DBA performance degradation can be reduced by exploiting multi-threading. It is found that for both standards, multi-threading, if done properly, can be used to mitigate the performance degradation due to the increased reach. To make bandwidth allocation efficient, new schemes for coordinating the multiple threads are required in long reach PON.",

In particular, software defined radio related study results are presented with a focus on SDR architectures for mobile devices such as mobile phones. For MDs, a novel architecture and inherent interfaces are presented enabling the usage of SDR principles in a mass market context. Cognitive radio principles within ETSI RRS are concentrated on two topics, a cognitive pilot channel proposal and a Functional Architecture for Management and control of reconfigurable radio systems, including dynamic self-organizing planning and management, dynamic spectrum management, joint radio resource management. Finally, study results are indicated that are targeting a SDR/CR security framework.",

      "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks are highly dynamic networks that offer multihop communications in the presence of changing topologies without the need for any fixed infrastructure support. These networks can be useful in a wide variety of scenarios, but setting them up and deploying services on them is a difficult task, even for experienced users. In this article we present EasyMANET - an extensible platform the main objective of which is to encourage the widespread adoption and use of MANETs by non-expert users. To achieve this objective, EasyMANET provides two essential elements: an address autoconfiguration system and a name resolution service known as Visual DNS. The autoconfiguration system allows users to join an 802.11-based MANET by establishing the parameters of their terminal interfaces quickly and transparently. Thereafter, Visual DNS offers a graphical view of MANET participants and gives users the possibility to access the services made available by other users. Examples are communication services (text-based chat, VoIP, videoconference), file sharing, and localization services. We performed several laboratory experiments, and evaluated the performance of EasyMANET based on address autoconfiguration time and Visual DNS performance. Results show that EasyMANET can be established within seconds, and EasyMANET applications are easy to use. In fact, over 360 students have tried using Easy- MANET without problems.",

      "abstract": "Communication service providers deliver value-added services to customers based on their available network transport services. Some services extend beyond the boundaries of a single CSP and require the collaboration of several CSPs to provide inter-CSP services. Transport services for next-generation value-added services are currently based on expensive connection oriented technologies such as synchronous digital hierarchy and optical transport networks. Data-oriented technologies have recently been considered for transport networks (e.g., Ethernet and MPLS variants) due to their efficiency, simplicity, and better suitability for data traffic, which dominates the transport networks. Currently, CSP transport networks are isolated and inter-CSP transport service provisioning involves human-to-human negotiations and manual setup of network devices. Next-generation CSPs must provide QoS intra-service-to-customer, inter-CSP, and customer-to-customer transport services that are generic, automatically provisioned, and based on business logic that can be expressed easily and uniformly. A transport service layer architecture for automatic provisioning of inter-CSP transport services is suggested here, based on standard Ethernet technology. This transport service layer architecture is part of the Ethernet transport network architecture that takes into account business relations among carriers. It enables various class-of-service transport services based on multi-constraint matching and optimizations. The resulting transport service provisioning is automated and optimized, and significantly decreases the involved inter-CSP service setup operations.",

There are many approaches to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission and to prevent the global warming, and one of the important approaches is the Intelligent Transport Systems. This article surveys the effects of the ITS on the energy saving and global warming prevention based on the data in Japan, focusing on the applications of vehicular communication technologies. The ITS could contribute to the energy saving on two aspects: one is to eliminate the congestion, which enables each automobile to drive at the fuel optimal speeds, and the other is to provide means for modal shift, which reduces the traffic. This article surveys the ITS technologies for energy saving and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction, which include traffic signal control, ETC, route guidance, cruise control, and automated driving. The road-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-vehicle communications play an essential role in energy saving as well as in the safety of automobiles and road transportation.",

Situation assessment, encompassing automated threat and impact assessment, shall assist human analysts by estimating the critical activities and objects in an emerging situation. The existing work on situation assessment, while serving its individual purposes, is not driven explicitly by the need to enhance situation awareness. This article provides a summary of various related work, ranging from visualization to algorithmic threat projection, and describes a human-centered framework that associates situation assessment processes and models with requirements needed to enhance situation awareness.",

      "abstract": "Beyond the initial focus on vehicular safety application, there is considerable scope for the development of other information-rich applications, which can provide convenience and comfort features to drivers and passengers. We argue that an Internet-like end-to-end networking framework might not always be the best fit for the unique nature of vehicular application - spatially and temporally localized, dynamic, and data-intensive. In this research challenge article, we propose a top-down framework called Information- Centric Networking on Wheels to develop a generic network architecture supporting futuristic information-rich VANET applications, ranging from location-based services to real-time audio/video transfer. The key design philosophy of our proposed framework is that VANET communication is scoped by three key characteristics of information relevance: space, time, and user interest. Using this philosophy, we advocate the development of protocols for information dissemination and management that allow for localized in-network operations. An important feature of the proposed IC NoW framework is that protocols and applications are implemented in a distributed manner using local decision rule sets, taking into account fresh local information. We also pay special attention to ensure the proposed framework is easy to interface with existing cellular infrastructure, whenever needed. This framework enables modular design, facilitating easy application development and creating a smooth migration path during the deployment evolution path.",

In this converged communication infrastructure, users move across networks and access services seamlessly using different devices. Voice and video over IP is one of the emerging technologies in the realization of FMC. In this article we first discuss the features and technological requirements of FMC networks. We then present an architecture for implementing FMC and describe how to realize the voice call continuity of VoIP sessions using the current IP infrastructure. We further identify the requirements for VVoIP in ensuring video call continuity as well as the challenges associated with the migration from voice to multimedia services.",

To realize these capabilities, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers with dynamic add/drop structures, embedded control planes, and lightpath characterization are required. This article presents the architectures and various ROADM implementations including colorless, directionless, and contentionless add/drop structures. The effect of scaling bit rates beyond 100 Gb/s on ROADM architectures is reviewed including providing variable channel bandwidth depending on bit rate. Automated provisioning and restoration using the GMPLS control plane and optical measurement approaches for lightpaths are also discussed.",

Such environments become more commonplace in higher-speed environments, as more optical amplifiers are deployed in networks. Many generations of FEC have been implemented, including block codes and concatenated codes. Developers now have options to consider hard-decision and soft-decision codes. This article describes the advantages of each type in particular transmission environments.",

Thus, they provide the resources for what we envision as a human pervasive network: a network formed by user devices, suitable to convey to users rich multimedia content and services according to their interests and needs. Similar to opportunistic networks, where the communication is built on connectivity opportunities, we envisage a network above these resources that joins together features of traditional pervasive networks and opportunistic networks fostering a new computing paradigm: opportunistic computing. In this article we discuss the evolution from opportunistic networking to opportunistic computing; we survey key recent achievements in opportunistic networking, and describe the main concepts and challenges of opportunistic computing. We finally envision further possible scenarios and functionalities to make opportunistic computing a key player in the next-generation Internet.",

      "abstract": "Road topology information has recently been used to assist geographic routing in urban vehicular environments to improve overall routing performance. However, the unreliable nature of wireless channels due to motion and obstructions still makes road topology assisted geographic routing challenging. In this article we begin by reviewing conventional road topology assisted geographic routing protocols, and investigate the robust routing protocols that address and help overcome the unreliable wireless channels. We then present topology-assisted geo-opportunistic routing that incorporates topology assisted geographic routing with opportunistic forwarding. That is, the routing protocol exploits the simultaneous packet receptions induced by the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and performs opportunistic forwarding via a subset of neighbors that have received the packet correctly. Our simulation results confirm TO-GO's superior robustness to channel errors and collisions compared to conventional topology-assisted geographic routing protocols.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the innovative features of Ginga-NCL, an open middleware specification for multimedia IPTV services. Ginga-NCL relies on the Nested Context Language, a domain-specific declarative language targeting multimedia application authoring. As a glue language, NCL relates media objects in time and space without restricting or imposing any media content type, including media objects with imperative and declarative code written using other languages. Other NCL features include support for multidevice presentations, content adaptations, presentation adaptations, and advanced code reuse. Ginga-NCL allows NCL applications to be modified on the fly by means of live editing commands. Initially defined as the standard middleware for the Brazilian terrestrial DTV system, Ginga-NCL has recently become part of ISDB standards and an ITU-T Recommendation for IPTV services.",

      "abstract": "Today, the Internet is very diversified, further complicating the classic NAT traversal problems. In order to solve these problems, there are many proposed methods classified into two categories. One enhances the NAT traversal techniques of applications, and the other tries to modify the behavior of NATs. In this article we focus on the former because NATs have been installed, and their behavior cannot be altered through endpoint users. Accordingly, in order to test NAT traversal techniques of five VoIP applications (Skype, MSN, Google Talk, X-Lite, and Linphone), three network topologies have been designed with two endpoints behind the same, different, or multilevel NATs. Through a series of experiments and from the experiment results, we observe that these VoIP applications use some traversal techniques, such as NAT mappedaddress probe, peer discovery, path check, and relay first, proposed by STUN, TURN, and ICE to make a direct connection when endpoints are behind the same or different NATs with independent mapping rules. However, with multilevel NATs, no endpoints can establish a direct connection when they use the above mentioned techniques, even if hairpin behavior is supported by NATs.",

The standard is designed to meet both in-home multimedia and utility application requirements including smart grid. The utility requirements and the resulting features that support those requirements were clustered together and form the basis of what is referred to as the utility access cluster. This article explains the aspects of P1901 power line communication technologies designed to address the access cluster. The differences between access and in-home applications, including addressing methods, clock synchronization, smart repetition, quality of service, power saving, and other access unique mechanisms, are also explained.",

      "abstract": "Ethernet is the dominant wireline communications technology for LANs with over 1 billion interfaces installed in the U.S. and over 3 billion worldwide. In 2006 the IEEE 802.3 Working Group started an effort to improve the energy efficiency of Ethernet. This effort became IEEE P802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) resulting in IEEE Std 802.3az-2010, which was approved September 30, 2010. EEE uses a Low Power Idle mode to reduce the energy consumption of a link when no packets are being sent. In this article, we describe the development of the EEE standard and how energy savings resulting from the adoption of EEE may exceed $400 million per year in the U.S. alone (and over $1 billion worldwide). We also present results from a simulation-based performance evaluation showing how packet coalescing can be used to improve the energy efficiency of EEE. Our results show that packet coalescing can significantly improve energy efficiency while keeping absolute packet delays to tolerable bounds. We are aware that coalescing may cause packet loss in downstream buffers, especially when using TCP/IP. We explore the effects of coalescing on TCP/IP flows with an ns-2 simulation, note that coalescing is already used to reduce packet processing load on the system CPU, and suggest open questions for future work. This article will help clarify what can be expected when EEE is deployed.",

      "abstract": "The IP multimedia subsystem defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project is the architecture merging the Internet and telecom worlds. The IMS was designed to make it easy for third-party developers to make their applications available to all IMS users, and by doing so provide more than only the basic telecom services like voice, messaging, presence and contact management. However, good knowledge of the IMS network architecture and the underlying Internet protocols is still needed to develop IMS applications. In addition, telecom expertise is needed to deploy the application and provision users. To ease the development and deployment process, it is essential to provide application developers with APIs and similar tools available for Web 2.0 application development today. In this article we explore the architectural and protocol aspects that enable third-party IMS application development and deployment. We also study how the applications will coexist with other applications already deployed in the IMS. Moreover, we describe Java libraries exploiting the functionality of the IMS both in the terminal client and within the core network. We also show how these Java libraries can be used for developing and deploying new applications in an IMS testbed, which provides IMS functionality over commercial 3G networks.",

      "abstract": "The recent advances in wireless client devices and the crucial role of multimedia communications in our society have motivated relevant standardization efforts, such as the IP multimedia subsystem, to support session control, mobility, and interoperability in all-IP next-generation networks. IMS has already driven the design of commercial mobile multimedia, but exhibits limited support for service continuity during handoffs. In particular, it omits advanced techniques to reduce/eliminate handoff delays, especially during vertical handoffs (i.e., change of the wireless technology employed by a client to access the wired Internet, e.g., from UMTS to WiFi). We propose an original solution for session continuity based on the primary design guideline of cleanly and effectively separating the signaling plane (for session reconfiguration via SIP) from the media delivery plane (data transmission and related handoff management operations). Our optimized handoff management techniques exploit terminal-based decentralized predictions to minimize service-level handoff delays. Different from other recent related work, our proposal fully complies with the standard IMS infrastructure and works at the application level. The reported experimental results point out that our solution, available as an open source tool for the IMS community, reduces playout interruption times relevantly by introducing a limited and scalable signaling overhead.",

This article focuses on relay architectures in 16m and LTE-A, and discusses design principles and trade-offs leading to decisions in each standards group. Basically, 16m relay and LTE-A Release 10 relay are very similar technologies where the relay is essentially an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access base station with a wireless backhaul link. However, some open issues, such as mobility, power saving, multihop architecture, transparent relaying, multi-arrier transmission, and cooperative transmission, are still left as challenges for engineers and researchers. This article provides insights to both relay standards that could be helpful for readers to fully comprehend practical ways of incorporating relays into 4G wireless broadband networks.",

Considering that modern GPU is suitable for parallel computing due to its numerous powerful arithmetic logic units, we suggest a proper architecture of hardware and software platform for the SDR modem to be implemented on GPU. Then, we show a design example of mobile WiMAX terminal implemented on the proposed GPU platform. In our experimental tests, we observed that the GPU-driven modem is nearly 90 times faster than the conventional 8-way Very Long Instruction Word architectured DSP-driven modem for the application of Viterbi decoder implementation of mobile WiMAX terminal.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of mobile fixed-power devices, energy consumption emerged as a vibrant research and development subject area in networking. Mobile devices are designed with several hard constraints such as low cost and small geometries, as well as, low heat dissipation, and operation using fixed power sources. Manufacturers have been adding an ever increasing set of features to small mobile devices, which are no longer binary-use gadgets, but fully-fledged computers. With respect to power management, several mechanisms have been introduced; but, by and large, gains in power consumption at the hardware level have been essentially traded for extended functionality. All in all, the overall operational time has not increased. For example, early GSM cellular phones could only allow for less than an hour of talk time in a single battery charge. By the late 1990s, top models, introduced through better engineering and an evolutionary development approach, featured talk times increased by a factor of 3-5. This level of performance has remained the same over the last decade, although it is well below user expectations. This article reviews the evolution from simple cell phones toward the feature-rich mobile networked devices we have come to expect from manufacturers, and explains the factors that have led to stagnation in operational time. We then turn our attention to the multiaccess nature of modern mobile devices and the respective implications for power management. We find that the current host-centric mobile networking paradigm, based on end-to-end always on connectivity, leads to energy-inefficient operation. Finally, this article introduces information-centric networking and outlines open research issues in the design of energy-efficient future Internet architectures.",

These have significantly advanced the state of applications of intelligent transportation systems. More recently, as one leading effort toward the cyber-physical-social system, the concept of intelligent transportation spaces was proposed to further improve the vehicles, traffic, and transportation safety, efficiency and sustainability. ITSp integrate not only various ITS modules, but also pedestrians, vehicles, roadside infrastructures, traffic management centers, sensors, and satellites. With distributed and pervasive intelligence, ITSp clearly impose some stringent requirements on the information exchange among all entities within the ITSp, in terms of the information availability, reliability, fidelity, and timeliness. These requirements, together with the high mobility of vehicles and the highly variable network topology, make the communications and networking for ITSp very challenging. This article will introduce the concept of ITSp and analyze possible communication technology candidates for ITSp. Further discussions will also be provided at the end of this article.",

      "abstract": "4G cellular standards are targeting aggressive spectrum reuse (frequency reuse 1) to achieve high system capacity and simplify radio network planning. The increase in system capacity comes at the expense of SINR degradation due to increased intercell interference, which severely impacts cell-edge user capacity and overall system throughput. Advanced interference management schemes are critical for achieving the required cell edge spectral efficiency targets and to provide ubiquity of user experience throughout the network. In this article we compare interference management solutions across the two main 4G standards: IEEE 802.16m (WiMAX) and 3GPP-LTE. Specifically, we address radio resource management schemes for interference mitigation, which include power control and adaptive fractional frequency reuse. Additional topics, such as interference management for multitier cellular deployments, heterogeneous architectures, and smart antenna schemes will be addressed in follow-up papers.",

This article gives a concise but comprehensive overview of the Internet QoS puzzle. We aim not only at identifying all the pieces of the puzzle, but also at discovering how to join them together. These include terminology, definitions and standards, architectures, traffic engineering, regulation, accounting, pricing, and marketing. We also explain throughout the article how network providers should envision their service offerings in the context of an SLA and QoS-centric Internet.",

It has formed the basis for a wide range of dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio demonstration systems presented at a number of international conferences between 2007 and 2010. These systems have been developed using heterogeneous processing platforms including generalpurpose processors, field-programmable gate arrays and the Cell Broadband Engine. Focusing on runtime reconfiguration, Iris offers support for all layers of the network stack and provides a platform for the development of not only reconfigurable point-to-point radio links but complete networks of cognitive radios. This article provides an overview of Iris, presenting the unique features of the architecture and illustrating how it can be used to develop a cognitive radio testbed.",

      "abstract": "The radios in mobile Internet devices and smart phones need to support a wide range of wireless standards for cellular, broadband, local, and personal area network connectivity, satellite navigation, and broadcast digital television in a small form factor with low energy consumption. The customary approach is to integrate an optimized antenna, front-end, baseband, and MAC for each protocol; however, any upgrades or modifications for new or different product definitions require a costly respin of the silicon. An alternative approach is to integrate flexible components including an antenna, front-end, baseband, and MAC into a radio that enables one set of hardware to satisfy multiple protocols and also provides scalability for protocol changes in the future; however, there is a penalty in terms of area and power that has to be considered. An example of a flexible baseband is the Scalable Communications Core. This core was developed by Intel Labs and consists of a heterogeneous set of coarse-grained programmable accelerators connected via a packet-based network-on-chip. To understand the area and power cost of the architecture, we taped out a prototype SCC test chip in a 65 nm CMOS process, and programmed and validated it for multiple protocols, including WiFi, WiMAX, GPS, Bluetooth, and DVB-H. This article summarizes our key results in architecture, programming, interconnection, and performance of a flexible baseband for realtime wireless communications applications.",

      "abstract": "Telephone network operation and management tasks rely on the collection of data logs to effectively troubleshoot problems and observe trends. As operators try to streamline their investments in monitoring systems, data logs collected for other purposes represent a valuable and handy source of information for these tasks. A common example for both traditional public switched telephone and IP telephony networks ones are call detail records (also termed call data records). These contain detailed information about telephone calls such as the identities of sources and destinations, the duration of each call, and reply codes. Unfortunately, the way CDRs are collected and their formats can vary significantly among different operators. Without careful consideration of the basic principles and requirements outlined in this article, the use of any type of data logs for traffic management, security, and engineering purposes can become quite cumbersome and even result in misleading conclusions. The intention of this article is to support other researchers and practitioners working with telephony logs. Therefore, we provide an overview of the most relevant lessons we have learned when dealing with massive amounts of CDRs from different operators, such as how to handle different non-standard logging formats across operators and understanding common sources of call log analysis errors.",

Underwater sensor nodes with sensing and communication capabilities form the underwater acoustic sensor network. Localizing the underwater sensor nodes is one of the fundamental tasks for UASNs where the location information can be used in data tagging, routing, and node tracking. Localization for UASNs is an active research topic where a large number of techniques have been proposed recently.

In both standards, multiple-input multiple-output antenna technologies play an essential role in meeting the 4G requirements. The application of MIMO technologies is one of the most crucial distinctions between 3G and 4G. It not only enhances the conventional point-to-point link, but also enables new types of links such as downlink multiuser MIMO. A large family of MIMO techniques has been developed for various links and with various amounts of available channel state information in both IEEE 802.16e/m and 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced. In this article we provide a survey of the MIMO techniques in the two standards. The MIMO features of the two are compared, and the engineering considerations are depicted.",

Nowadays, users can share contents and information, but they are also able to compose services thanks to new user-oriented service platforms. In this article a distributed orchestration service execution environment for converged service platforms running over next-generation networks is presented, together with its main support function, the Dispatcher, an element which carries out load balancing and policy enforcement. Taking advantage of the intelligence and support operations offered by NGNs, this kind of SEE is specifically useful for telecommunication operators entering the value added service market, because it simplifies the implementation of their service-specific security and billing policies, and additionally allows easy service execution management for non-expert end users by offering service start and stop functionalities at the push of a button.",

Nextgeneration mobile networks, such as LTE Release 10, will increase the requirement for backhaul capacity to gigabits per second. In order to increase network utilization and decrease operating expenses, carrier Ethernet transport infrastructure (MPLS and carrier grade Ethernet) will be deployed and maintained at a lower total cost of ownership than legacy TDM transport infrastructure. This article discusses different migration scenarios from the circuit-switched legacy backhaul networks toward packet-based networks.",

Platforms have evolved from the first generation add/drop multiplexer to the next generation multiservice provisioning platform and today's packet optical transport platform. This article discusses our findings in the application of Moore's Law to these optical transport platforms in capacity, power, space, and capital cost. It also discusses our findings in using Moore's Law as a presumption to explore the operations cost savings in power consumption, office floor space, and maintenance. Payback periods for the capital cost of new technology from energy and operations savings are investigated.

      "abstract": "Path finding by multiple robots has been studied by many researchers. In particular, when the robot is able to communicate with other colleague robots, path finding will be solved collaboratively among the robots. The main motivation of this article is to apply wireless multihop communications to the collaborative path-finding problem. For this purpose, we propose a cooperative path finding algorithm (CPA) and report its performance by real implementation on ZigBee-based micro-robots as well as MATLAB simulations. There has been some controversy over the use of wireless multihop communications in commercial wireless networks for technical as well as non-technical reasons. However, our study highlights a new potential of multihop communications in inter-robot information exchange. We show the effects of wireless communications on the operation of cooperative multi-robots and find the benefit of multihop communications.",

      "abstract": "As one of the candidate fourth-generation mobile communication systems, the IEEE 802.16m-based WiMAX 2.0 system is required to provide up to 1 Gb/s peak transmission rate. The most efficient solution to achieve this challenging objective is to utilize wider channel bandwidth. Multicarrier is the technology to utilize wider bandwidth for parallel data transmission across multiple RF carriers, which is well agreed as one of the key technologies to satisfy ITU-R IMTAdvanced requirements. As the evolution of the IEEE 802.16e-based WiMAX 1.0 system, IEEE 802.16m specifies physical and MAC layers to enable multicarrier technology for the WiMAX 2.0 system. This can lead to more than 1 Gb/s peak transmission rate for low-mobility users and 100 Mb/s peak transmission rate for high-mobility users. By having the protocol structure with a common MAC entity to control transmission by multiple physical-layer connections over different RF carriers, the network operator can aggregate either contiguous or non-contiguous spectrum resources with higher deployment flexibility, user throughput, and spectrum efficiency. This article provides an overview of the multicarrier technology supported by the IEEE 802.16m draft standard1 for WiMAX 2.0 system, including not only the general operation principle but also some details of physical layer and MAC layer support.",

This requires explicit management of the interdomain relationships themselves rather than treating extra-domain resources or services as equivalent to internal capabilities. In this article we describe a general layered model for describing interdomain relationships and a concrete architecture for a domain relationship manager based on a combination of model-driven development and semantic web technology. Our prototyping efforts are discussed, and both examples and descriptions aid gaining an understanding of the underlying technologies. Finally, a use case is presented to illustrate the application of these techniques and especially to show the dynamic behavior of a system based on this engineering approach.",

      "abstract": "Testing network products in a beta site to reduce the possibility of customer found defects is a critical phase before marketing. We design and deploy an innovative beta site on the campus of National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. It can be used for developers to test and debug products, while maintaining network quality for network users. To satisfy the needs of developers, we set up environments and mechanisms, such as a variety of test zones for multiple types of products or systems under test (SUTs), remote control, degrees of traffic volume, and traffic profiling. For network users, we set up mechanisms of failure detection, notification, and recovery. The beta site network users are all volunteers. Test results show that beta site testing is good for finding stability and compatibility defects. The period starting from the beginning of a test until the next defect is found is called the time to fail (TTF). We call it converged if the TTF exceeds four weeks, and the convergence ratio is the percentage of SUTs that reach convergence. We find that the TTF increases with longer test duration, meaning that product quality improves through beta site testing. However, the convergence ratios are only 7 and 20 percent for test durations of one month and one year, respectively, meaning that few products operate faultlessly for a long duration. The convergence ratios also indicate that it takes much more time to enhance product quality to be converged. Therefore, if considering both marketing timing and product quality, one month is our suggested minimum TD for low-end and shortlife- cycle products. However, we recommend one year as the minimum TD for high-end and long-life-cycle products.",

      "abstract": "This article provides an overview of opportunities and challenges related to joint deployments of macro and femtocells. It provides insights on possible deployment architectures for femtocells along with an analysis framework for quantifying macro offloading benefits in realistic network deployment scenarios by means of advanced performance analysis techniques. Such benefits include potential enhancement in quality of radio signals for users served by the macro network in joint macro-femto deployments. This in turn translates into potentially better data rates (throughput) for macrocell users and may offer the possibility of adding more users to the macro network while preserving the network configuration -- resulting in direct capital expenditure savings. The approach taken in this article consists of creating a framework for quantifying macro offloading benefits in joint macro-femto deployments. A baseline configuration where all users (indoor and outdoor) are served by a traditional macro network (state-of-the-art macro only network) is considered first. The analysis is followed through joint macro-femto deployments, where femtocells serve indoor users. Through comparison of the baseline configuration and the joint macro-femto analysis, we quantify the benefits of the joint macro-femto deployment.",

      "abstract": "Mashups are web applications created through the integration of external resources available on the web. They have been considered a hallmark of Web 2.0 technologies, allowing end users to develop their own applications and encouraging cooperation and reuse. However, their usage in the network management field remains unexploited. In this context, we look at Web 2.0 as a feasible mechanism able to integrate heterogeneous management information. In this article, we propose an architecture and a system prototype that allows network administrators to design their own management applications through the composition of external resources. The creation of mashups for two network management scenarios allowed us to both evaluate our architecture and, mainly, observe benefits, challenges, and opportunities that arise from such an approach. Observed characteristics, such as ease of use, extensibility, and contextspecific development, make mashups a candidate for an interesting area for further research in the network management field.",

      "abstract": "IP service, leased-line service and POTS service have been the three long-standing communication service offerings of providers. Recently, both commercial and research-and-education network providers have started offering optical dynamic circuit services. This article reviews these services, differentiates DCS from leased-line services, offers a classification of DCS, and proposes two new types of DCS. DCS are classified into two types: Specified-Duration Scheduled and Unspecified-Duration Unscheduled. SDS service is less flexible than UDU service in that it requires users to specify call durations, and is more complex (needs reservation schedulers), but it is the only efficient option if link bandwidth is divided into a small number of channels (e.g., 1 Gb/s circuits on a 10 Gb/s link for fast transfers of large files). For SDS offerings, if the mean call duration is small, then a distributed scheduler implementation may be required to handle the high call arrival load required to maintain high utilization levels. Finally, SDS is classified into two sub-types: Specified Start Time and Earliest Start Time, based on whether the user can only accept a start time from within its own specified set of start times, or whether it can accept any, preferably earliest, start time. The SST sub-type is useful for applications requiring the co-scheduling of network bandwidth with other resources, while the EST sub-type is ideal for file transfers.",

      "abstract": "Future high-performance computing systems will require optical I/O to achieve their aggressive bandwidth requirements of multiple terabytes per second with energy efficiency better than 1 pJ/b. Near-term optical I/O solutions will integrate optical and electrical components in the package, but longer-term solutions will integrate photonic elements directly into the CMOS chip to further improve bandwidth and energy efficiency. The presented near-term optical I/O uses a customized package to assemble CMOS integrated transceiver circuits, discrete VCSEL/detector arrays, and polymer waveguides. Circuit simulations predict this architecture will achieve energy efficiency better than 1 pJ/b at the 16 nm CMOS technology node. Monolithic photonic CMOS process technology enables higher bandwidth and improved energy efficiency for chip-to-chip optical I/O through integration of electro-optical polymer based modulators, silicon nitride waveguides, and polycrystalline germanium (Ge) detectors into a CMOS logic process. Experimental results for the photonic CMOS ring resonator (RR) modulators and Ge detectors demonstrate performance at up to 40 Gb/s and analysis predicts that photonic CMOS will eventually enable energy efficiency of 0.3 pJ/b with 16 nm CMOS. Optical interconnect technologies with multilane communication or wavelength-division multiplexing will further increase bandwidth to provide the multiple-terabyte-per-second optical interconnect solution that enables scaling of high-performance computing into and beyond the tera-scale era.",

The collective efforts and data that may be generated by humans or sensors (or both) can be used to help solve difficult location awareness problems, such as realtime surface traffic estimation, city panoramas, and social networking analysis. The PLASH platform comprises three layers: communication, data, and service. An LAS application developed on PLASH can exploit the functions provided in each layer by using an application specification language provided by PLASH. In addition, application builders can contribute their mature applications as a service accommodated in the service layer for other application builders to expand and create more sophisticated applications.",

      "abstract": "Tactical edge networks present extremely challenging environments for communications given their wireless ad hoc nature and the inherent node mobility. Military applications such as Blue Force Tracking, inter-team communications, remote unmanned vehicle control, and sensor data mining/fusion thus have to deal with unstable links with limited bandwidth and variable latency. The peculiar characteristics of tactical networks call for peer-to-peer approaches to realize complex, adaptive, and fault-tolerant applications to be deployed in the battlefield. This article reports on our observations from several tactical networking experiments in which we have deployed state-of-the-art applications and services that leverage P2P communications. More specifically, we discuss why P2P approaches are critical for tactical network environments and applications. We then analyze the requirements that should be satisfied by P2P middleware for tactical environments. Finally, we discuss a case study, the Agile Computing Middleware, and present experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.",

Concepts such as ambient intelligence and home networks could be instrumental in realization of PES. Indeed, integration of elements of these technologies may attract industrial attention and support, which in turn may speed up the implementation and deployment of PES. Moreover, underlying technologies related to the above concepts are envisioned to play a key role in the realization of PES, including mobile communications supported by ubiquitous infrastructure and wireless personal area networks. In this article we present a simple PES network architecture and its underlying network technologies, and we discuss a set of potential services of PES. We also compare PES with other related concepts capable of supporting the PES vision.",

FTTH and ever-improving ADSL technologies are capable of offering to the final residential user a very-high-performance access network connection to the main door of our homes. At the same time, high-definition and interactive video will require higher and higher bit rates inside the home. Both drivers lead to the requirement for high-quality networking also inside homes, to avoid a somehow ironic, but indeed possible situation in which the home area network becomes the actual bottleneck of the full system. In this article we review the requirements for next-generation HANs and show that this environment may end up taking advantage of optical cabling solutions as an alternative to more traditional copper or pure wireless approaches.",

While the majority of recent contributions have discussed PLC for high-data-rate applications like Internet access or multimedia communication serving a relatively small number of users, in this article we are concerned with PLC as an enabler for sensing, control, and automation in large systems comprising tens or even hundreds of components spread over relatively wide areas. Typical examples of such systems are energy management (Smart Grid) and facility automation systems. We provide a discussion of the communication network requirements common to such systems and present transmission concepts for PLC to make use of the existing infrastructure resources (i.e., power lines) to meet these requirements.",

      "abstract": "Today's consumer electronics feature marvelous capabilities. From smartphones to in-car navigators to media players, all benefit from advances in underlying components such as RAM, GPS chips, and fast communications networks. Buddy-mapping applications, now possible and deployed on smartphones and personal navigation systems, are a meld of communications, instant messaging, location-aware service, and map mash-up. These kinds of applications can be incredibly useful and fun; at the same time, their feature creep can threaten user privacy. For example, the ability to map all buddies on a mobile smartphone via a mobile buddymapping application (e.g., Google Latitude) also makes it necessary to manage one's visibility with respect to a large number of buddies. As we explain in this article, this is of key importance since once one is seen on another's map, one's intent can sometimes be inferred; and even if intent is not something one is hiding per se, it is still desirable to know \"Who can see me now?\" and to be forewarned of impending visibility. Today's consumer communications applications and devices do not handle these requirements well. This article presents middleware architecture and methodology that can help give users of buddy-mapping services greater awareness of who is about to see them before they are actually seen.",

In this article we focus on OTN as a delivery platform for emerging services. We will understand why OTN was originally proposed and how it can be a critical enabler for emerging services. To this end, we build use cases of OTN especially for Ethernet transport, mobile backhaul, IP router interconnection, sub-wavelength support, and support of overlaid services, especially across multiple domains. The use cases will bring to the fore key advantages of OTN and how this technology solution is ideal for emerging applications. We also discuss future movements in this technology and how these can affect the transport network.",

Today's popular mobile Internet applications, such as voice, gaming, streaming, and social networking services, have diverse traffic characteristics and, consequently, different QoS requirements. A rather flexible QoS framework is highly desirable to be future-proof to deliver the incumbent as well as emerging mobile Internet applications. This article highlights QoS frameworks and features of OFDMA-based 4G technologies - IEEE 802.16e, IEEE 802.16m, and LTE - to support various applications' QoS requirements. A few advanced QoS features such as new scheduling service (i.e., aGP), quick access, delayed bandwidth request, and priority controlled access in IEEE 802.16m are explained in detail. A brief comparison of the QoS framework of the aforementioned technologies is also provided.",

The implementation of appropriate QoS policies is essential in order to maintain customer loyalty and fulfill regulators' requirements. ITU-T recommendation E.802 provides a framework for the identification of QoS criteria relevant to users and ISPs. This Recommendation also provides guidelines to derive measurable QoS parameters from identified criteria. This article presents a QoS management model and implementation methodology for ISPs. We ground our investigation on the E.802 framework, which ISPs may face when implementing ITU-T Recommendation G.1000. The proposed methodology is meaningful for users, vendors, and network operators. Furthermore, its conformance with the ITU-T standard makes it suitable and deployment-ready for both regulators and providers.",

      "abstract": "3GPP long term evolution is one of the major steps in mobile communication to enhance the user experience for next-generation mobile broadband networks. In LTE, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access is adopted in the downlink of its E-UTRA air interface. Although cross-layer techniques have been widely adopted in literature for dynamic resource allocation to maximize data rate in OFDMA wireless networks, application-oriented quality of service for video delivery, such as delay constraint and video distortion, have been largely ignored. However, for wireless video delivery in LTE, especially delay-bounded real-time video streaming, higher data rate could lead to higher packet loss rate, thus degrading the user-perceived video quality. In this article we present a new QoS-aware LTE OFDMA scheduling algorithm for wireless real-time video delivery over the downlink of LTE cellular networks to achieve the best user-perceived video quality under the given application delay constraint. In the proposed approach, system throughput, application QoS constraints, and scheduling fairness are jointly integrated into a cross-layer design framework to dynamically perform radio resource allocation for multiple users, and to effectively choose the optimal system parameters such as modulation and coding scheme and video encoding parameters to adapt to the varying channel quality of each resource block. Experimental results have shown significant performance enhancement of the proposed system.",

      "abstract": "A presence service enables the discovery and retrieval of, and subscription to changes in, an end user's context information. RESTful web services are now emerging as a lighter alternative to the so-called Big Web services. This article presents an early feasibility prototype of a RESTful web-services-based architecture. The architecture enables the discovery and retrieval of and subscription to changes in context information, independent of the technologies used in the end users' domains. Concretely, it enables end users with multiple presence accounts (e.g., MSN, Yahoo, Gmail) to publish context information related to the account(s) they are using at any given time. It also enables other end users or applications to retrieve this information by subscribing to any of the multiple accounts of the publisher. The project has demonstrated that RESTful web services are quite suitable for bridging services across technologies and domains. It has also demonstrated that a RESTful web services approach has several advantages over a traditional web services (also known as Big Web services) approach. However, more functionality needs to be added to the prototype before market introduction is contemplated. The lessons learned are discussed and the missing functionalities are identified.",

For example, despite its rich set of traffic management capabilities, electronic packet switching requires hundreds of expensive optical/electrical/optical converter pairs just to terminate a single DWDM link. While optical switching technologies can bypass O/E/O conversion, neither of the two practical optical switching technologies, optical circuit switching or optical burst switching, can switch at the packet level. The proposed novel DWDM multimode switching router architecture allows electronic packet switching, optical circuit switching, and optical burst switching to be supported concurrently on an integrated router platform. In the proposed approach, the router supports a large number of DWDM channels cost effectively by maintaining a relatively small set of shared, though expensive, electronic switching ports. With this architecture, each DWDM channel can be individually reconfigured to a different switching mode, based on the dynamic traffic load. Individual applications, or individual types of messages within an application, can choose the mode that best suits its need.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of the latest generation of ROADMs in the communication long-haul transport networks allows network planners to consider some new cost-effective design alternatives. Specifically, for video broadcast services ROADM wavelength drop-and-continue technology enables simple wavelength connections at each node via a tree-like topology, and the intelligent control plane permits the use of various shared protection schemes (with failure restoration switching times comparable to SONET BLSR). In this article we formulate models for reliable TV/video broadcast. We consider the network topologies based on minimum spanning trees. The objective is to minimize the total network cost while ensuring that the broadcast, originating in one (or two) source node(s), is delivered to a set of destination nodes and the network will tolerate at least one single link failure. The resulting protected tree networks are illustrated, and the cost of protection strategies is analyzed.",

Situations have previously been studied in different domains, as composite events in distributed event based systems, service composition in multi-agent systems, and macro-programming in sensor networks. However, existing languages do not address the specific challenges posed by sensor networks. This article presents a novel language for representing situations in sensor networks that addresses these challenges. Three algorithms for recognizing situations in relevant fields are reviewed and adapted to sensor networks. In particular, distributed commitment machines are introduced and demonstrated to be the most suitable algorithm among the three for recognizing situations in sensor networks.",

Among the emerging technologies is the radio on free-space optics system described in this article. With this technology it is possible to simultaneously transmit multiple RF signals comprising heterogeneous wireless services over FSO links using wavelength-division multiplexing technology. Moreover, the RoFSO technology can be applied as a universal platform for enabling seamless convergence of fiber and free-space optical communication networks, thus extending broadband connectivity to underserved areas. We present the design concept and highlight some experimental results obtained from performance evaluation of the RoFSO system we have developed. Using the quality metric parameters defined for the different RF service signals transmitted over the experimental RoFSO system, the results demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of reliability and stability. Considering the potential of RoFSO technology, as demonstrated in our studies, we propose a study for standardization work in the ITU, which can lead to its rapid adoption.",

      "abstract": "NATO Network Enabled Capability is first and foremost about achieving better interaction between the different actors involved in military operations. This implies more efficient exchange of information. Consequently, the NATO information infrastructure will consist of a federation of systems, including a plethora of different information and communication systems, as well as a mix of new and legacy systems. NATO recommends a service-oriented architecture approach based on Web services to enable such a federation. In this article we explain how the communication protocols normally used in Web services are unsuited for disadvantaged and heterogeneous networks. We then present our prototype proxy, which enables the use of standard unmodified Web services across all network types, including tactical networks with low data rates and frequent disruptions. It is designed to work with existing security mechanisms, and also offers further optimizations in the form of optional plug-ins.",

      "abstract": "This article outlines the basic principles of single-carrier frequency division multiple access with iterative multiuser detection, called grouped frequency division multiple access. GFDMA allows multiple users to share a common set of subcarriers and separates the signals of users by employing distinct interleavers and frequency-domain multiuser detection. Some attractive features of GFDMA are explained, including low-cost iterative multiuser detection, multiuser and frequency diversity gains, and flexibility in resource allocation. We also discuss the applications of GFDMA to spatial diversity schemes and to intercell interference mitigation in the cell edge. It is shown that GFDMA offers advantages over SC-FDMA with respect to power/spectral efficiency. Such power/spectral efficiency can provide considerable performance improvements in future wireless communication networks.",

The contribution of this article is threefold. First, it outlines those common characteristics that impair communication in high-stress environments and then evaluates their importance, specifically in the underground mine environment. Second, it discusses current underground mine communication techniques and identifies their potential problems. Third, it explores the design of wireless sensor network based communication and location sensing systems that could potentially address current challenges. Finally, preliminary results are presented of an empirical study of communication using a WSN constructed from commercially available wireless sensor nodes in an underground mine near Parkes, New South Wales, Australia.",

In order to meet the requirements of network operators and service providers, the telecommunication industry and international standardization bodies have recently paid intensive attention to the research and development of self-organizing networks. In this article we first introduce both the market and technological perspectives for SONs. Then we focus on the self-configuration procedure and illustrate a self-booting mechanism for a newly added evolved NodeB without a dedicated backhaul interface. Finally, mobility load balancing as one of the most important selfoptimization issues for Long Term Evolution networks is discussed, and a distributed MLB algorithm with low handover cost is proposed and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation networks offer new opportunities and challenges to Internet service providers as well as providers of other online services. Service providers can now deploy new services over an IP network infrastructure without building their own networks. In an open network environment, the network resources of ISPs should be fairly open to third parties that plan to launch their own services over the network. To actively respond to the changing network paradigm, it is essential to measure the traffic of individual services, and to estimate their cost for cost accounting between service provider and ISP. However, current traffic measurement techniques only provide the total traffic volume in links, without reporting the operator whose services flow through the links. Some commercial products can classify traffic into each application at a specific spot, but we should install monitoring systems at every spot throughout the entire network in order to observe which service traffic flows in every link. To satisfy the requirements of the NGN environment, we developed the Service Traffic Management System that can analyze the traffic of individual services based on user log data. STMS can report not only the traffic of individual services in every link, but also user behavior for each service. In addition, this article shares our experience of STMS development. We also introduce how we utilize STMS in IP network design, and discuss business and management support.",

      "abstract": "Today's consumers have a wide variety of interactive media and services at their disposal, for instance, through IPTV networks, the Internet, and in-home and mobile networks. A major problem, however, is that media and services do not interoperate across networks because they use different user identities, metadata formats, and signaling protocols, for example. As a result, users cannot easily combine media and services from different network infrastructures and share them in an integrated manner with their family and friends. In addition to limiting people's media experience, this also hinders the introduction of new services and business models as providers cannot easily develop and operate cross-network services. The goal of our work is to overcome this problem by means of an open and intelligent service platform that allows applications to easily combine media and services from different network infrastructures, and enables consumers to easily share them in an integrated way. The platform includes support for managing multi-user sessions across networks, context-aware recommendations, and cross-network identity management. While there has been prior work on platforms for converged media, our platform is unique in that it provides open, intelligent, and interoperable facilities for sharing media and services across network infrastructures. In addition, our work involves several specific innovations, for instance, pertaining to cross-network session management and synchronization. In this article we discuss the platform, its most important enabling services, and some of the applications we have built on top of it. We also briefly consider the new kinds of business models our platform makes possible.",

SPB is built on the IEEE 802.1 standards, and inherits unaltered the existing OAM and data plane scalability enhancements, such as the MAC-in-MAC forwarding paradigm. SPB introduces link state control for bridge networks, thus improving control plane scalability, network bandwidth utilization, and control of the forwarding paths. Furthermore, SPB minimizes latency by forwarding frames on the shortest path. Network-wide load balancing is also supported by spreading the traffic on multiple equal cost paths in a user controllable manner. Thus, SPB provides enhanced control for Ethernet networks in metro, RAN backhaul, or data center environments.",

SAT includes three main components: an attribute-based policy control model for highly dynamic communication environments, a proactive trust model to build trust among vehicles, and prevent the breakage of existing trust, and an email-based social network trust system to enhance trust and to allow the set up of a decentralized trust framework. To deploy SAT, we utilize identity-based cryptography to integrate entity trust, data trust, security policy enforcement, and social network trust, allocating a unique identity, and a set of attributes for each entity. We conclude by presenting research challenges and potential research directions that extend this work.",

      "abstract": "It is widely recognized that the centralized approach to spectrum management currently used in most countries has led to highly inefficient allocations. It is also recognized that more efficient allocations could be achieved through spectrum markets; however, most discussions have so far focused on secondary markets, which are managed by licensees. Here we take a more expansive view, and discuss some challenges and implications of implementing extensive spectrum markets across locations, time, and diverse sets of applications. The discussion is motivated by first examining the fundamental question: Is spectrum scarce or abundant? Given that spectrum is indeed scarce, and that spectrum property rights are appropriately defined, we speculate on the emergence of a two-tier market; the upper tier consists of spectrum owners that trade spectrum assets analogous to land rights, and the lower tier consists of spot markets for limited-duration rentals of spectrum assets from owners at particular locations. The changes such spectrum markets could bring to the provision of wireless services and wireless network design are discussed along with methods for addressing related interference management issues.",

      "abstract": "The inherent need for stable standards is difficult to reconcile with the aim of developing state-of-the-art standards and combine standardization with innovation. Standards change is inevitable, leads to increased transaction costs, and calls prior interoperability into question. In this article we analyze the problem of standards change as a feature of innovation. The focus is on the dynamics associated with committee standards when specifications and technologies co-evolve. We consider disruptions in the technology and/or the value chain simultaneously to classify innovations into four types. By identifying the type of innovation at hand, innovation-specific issues of standards change can be singled out. We illustrate this with the case of standards for next-generation Ethernet networks.",

IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network, known as Wi-Fi, has become a standard feature on these devices and represents a viable alternative to using a mobile phone provider's network for connectivity. Users can surf the web, make VoIP calls, and more from their home WLAN networks or public hotspots. At present WLAN has too many outstanding issues to universally replace existing mobile phone networks. However, WLAN is ready to provide universal coverage for mobile devices in large controlled environments such as university and business campuses, sports stadia, and entertainment parks. In this article we outline the challenges in such a deployment and describe how the state of the art in WLAN can meet these challenges. Outstanding issues and areas requiring improvement are highlighted. With a view to overcoming these hurdles, some potential solutions and promising research directions are outlined.",

      "abstract": "As we step further into the 21st century, the demand for sustainable energy-efficient technology grows higher. The important area of electric lighting, currently dominated by decades-old incandescent and fluorescent sources, is being taken over by white light emitting diodes, which are solid state devices with much greater energy savings. Replacement of current inefficient lighting by these LEDs will result in reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global warming, among other things. WLEDs hold the potential, in the field of photonics, to be as transformational as the transistor was in electronics. This core device has the potential to revolutionize how we use light, including not only for illumination, but also for communications, sensing, navigation, imaging, and many more applications. In this tutorial we highlight some of the potentials.",

The article discusses four agents of evolutionary changes: a range of broadband wireless access standards and technologies that are front-runners in the industry's efforts to embody the next generation of wireless networks; new provider-customer relationships facilitated through changes in the usual contract patterns that will allow consumers to enter short-term and spot contracts with the new wireless providers; an overview of the current debate on spectrum management; and an explanation of how autonomic communications and policy-based management would support the new structure. Finally, the article asserts the necessity for the integration of the heterogeneous technologies that make up this emerging, hybrid wireless landscape, and describes the economic characteristics of a new competitive scenario.",

      "abstract": "The digital television terrestrial multimedia broadcasting standard was ratified on August 18, 2006, and is the mandatory digital television terrestrial broadcasting standard in China. DTMB defines the signal frame structure, the coding and modulation schemes, and adopts time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing technology using pseudo random sequence as both the guard interval of the OFDM block and the training symbol. It can deliver fast system synchronization, accurate channel estimation, high spectrum efficiency, and excellent single-frequency network performance. This article covers the major features of the DTMB standard, its industrialization, current deployment status, and various applications based on the DTMB standard.",

      "abstract": "The agenda of technology for losers is closely related to a politically more correct concept of using technology to empower disadvantaged regions or individuals. Technology for losers emphasizes the fact that losers are those that had something valuable, which they have subsequently, for whatever reason, lost. Although commonly used as a highly patronizing and even offensive term, the term loser, literally, refers to diverse users of technology such as people marginalized because of unemployment, individuals with special needs, and poor people in developing regions. Hence, together they form a majority of humankind. Working with losers requires technology designers to focus more on urgent and concrete problems, while the traditional perspective of disadvantaged users calls for correct strategies at the policy level. The key characteristic of designing technology for losers is the fact that it starts from the identification of their strengths rather than needs or lacks; thus recognizing their ultimate resources, which can be released by re-equipping them with what they have lost.",

Today, laptops, PCs, printers, cellular phones, VoIP phones, MP3 players, Blu-Ray players, and many more devices incorporate wireless LAN technology. With low-cost chipsets and support for high data rates, 802.11 has become a universal solution for an ever increasing application space. As a direct consequence of its high market penetration, several amendments to the basic 802.11 standard have been developed or are under development. They fix technology issues or add functionality expected to be required by future applications. In this article we overview the emerging 802.11 standard and address the technical context of its extensions. The article highlights its finalized amendments and those under development.",

To do so, hosts use different addresses as locators for data packet transmission, but present the same source and destination identifier pair to transport and upper layers. The components of this architecture are the Shim6 entity, which maps and translates upper-layer identifiers and locators for remote hosts; the Shim6 protocol, which exchanges mapping information between two hosts that communicate; and the REAP protocol, which monitors the existing unidirectional paths and finds new valid locator combinations in case of failure. To protect against new vulnerabilities this architecture may introduce compared to IPv6, Shim6 hosts use either cryptographically generated addresses or hash-based addresses.",

      "abstract": "The IP multimedia subsystem is becoming the de facto standard for IP-based multimedia services, while wireless sensor networks are gaining in popularity due to their ability to capture a rich set of contextual information. Integrating the sensing capabilities of WSNs in the IMS can open the door to a wide range of context-aware applications in areas such as wireless healthcare and pervasive gaming. We have previously proposed a presence-based architecture for WSN/IMS integration. This architecture relies on two key components: a WSN/IMS gateway acting as an interworking unit between WSNs and the IMS; and an extended presence server serving as a context information management node in the core network. In this article we focus on the design and implementation of these two components. Furthermore, two applications (a pervasive game and a personalized call control application) are used to concretely show how new applications can be developed using our architecture. Performance has also been evaluated. Several important findings were made in the course of this work; one is that the IMS integration with a large and evolving variety of WSNs may be a never-ending endeavor - the gateway requiring constant upgrading due to the lack of standard APIs for the interaction with sensors produced by different vendors. Another finding is that while the introduction of context as an application building block in the IMS ensures the availability of additional contextual information in the network and enables fast and easy development of context-aware applications, the lack of mature IMS application development toolkits remains a roadblock.",

Today most voice traffic across the Atlantic is carried by fiber optic undersea cable. Satellites remain competitive in broadcast and thin route applications. Video distribution remains strong for satellites, and in mobile applications such as maritime and military telecom requirements for voice, data, and video. In disaster situations (e.g. the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile) satellite trucks with generators and small Earth stations provide quick communications when terrestrial facilities are damaged or destroyed.",

      "abstract": "This article describes how the compact disc digital audio system, also known as the CD system, was the result of the successful merger of two major existing technologies. They are first, optical readout of information stored on an optical disc of 11.5 cm diameter, and second, the digital coding/decoding and digital processing of audio signals. I will describe how a complete digital version of this new audio system gradually emerged, within Philips, during the period 1973-1979. Finally, this paper recounts the partnership and collaboration between Philips and Sony that resulted in a common CD standard in June 1980 which soon after became the world standard. More details on the history of the CD not discussed here can be found in a lively, and accurate, doctoral thesis (in German) by J. Lang and in a recent book.",

      "abstract": "One fundamental limit for synchronizing a packet trace is that the two measurement systems that can be used to timestamp the packets, the operating system and the network interface, have mutually exclusive properties. The OS clock can be stabilized over the long run but the OS timestamps are not accurate; the PHY timestamps are accurate but they show a drift. To leverage the best features of both systems, we propose to stabilize the OS clock with a GPS and to remap the PHY timestamps over the OS/GPS time. This method is well suited for challenged scenarios like VANETs as no signaling is needed between nodes. We apply our approach to VANET monitoring and evaluate it on packet traces collected from our testbed. The results show that our solution reduces the mean synchronization error to 3 \u03bcs.",

This paradigm shift has enabled the realization of cloud computing where data and computing resources are no longer located at the client side but are readily accessible in a remote data center via the Internet. To support cloud computing for a large population of Internet users, data centers must support enormous aggregate bandwidth on the order of hundreds of terabits per second. The required bandwidth will continue to rise due to increased broadband Internet users as attested by the more than 80 million in the United States alone as of 2010. By 2013, cloud computing is projected to increase by 300 percent.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output air interface design combined with radio resource management algorithms applicable to multi-user MIMO transmission in downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access systems. A low-complexity, adaptive, and channel-aware single-user and multi-user MIMO transmission solution is proposed based on the findings of the SURFACE European Commission funded research project. The resulting cross-layer design covers the reconfigurable air interface, and practical layer 1 and layer 2 RRM mechanisms for time-frequency packet scheduling. System-level performance analysis, including the effects of limited and imperfect feedback from the terminals, shows that the SURFACE air interface provides an attractive practical solution for operations with high-rate adaptive MIMO transmission schemes in the context of next-generation wireless communication systems.",

      "abstract": "The automated provisioning of services in cloud computing presents many challenges. Users can request virtual machines from cloud infrastructure providers, but these machines have to be configured and managed properly. This article describes an architecture that enables the automated deployment and management of the virtual infrastructure and software of services deployed in the cloud. The architecture takes a template description of a service, which encapsulates requirements, options, as well as behavior for a collection of resources and orchestrates the provisioning of this service into a newly created set of virtual resources. The template is used for integrating the deployment and reconfiguration behavior of a service in which logical components are described along with options to scale them and appropriately change their configuration. Services are described through a set of components, which can easily be mapped and remapped to dynamically created resources, letting services take full advantage of flexible cloud resources.",

      "abstract": "Wireless networks are on the verge of a third phase of growth. The first phase was dominated by voice traffic, and the second phase, which we are currently in, is dominated by data traffic. In the third phase we predict that the traffic will be dominated by video and will require new ways to optimize the network to prevent saturation. This increase in video traffic is one of the key drivers of the evolution to new mobile broadband standards like WiMAX IEEE 802.16m and 3G LTE and LTE-Advanced, motivating the need to enhance the video service capabilities of future cellular and mobile broadband systems. Therefore, it is important to understand both the potential and limitations of these networks for delivering video content in the future, which will include not only traditional video broadcasts, but also video streaming and uploading in the uplink direction. In that vein this article provides an overview of technology options for enabling multicast and unicast video services over WiMAX and LTE networks, quantifies and compares the video capacities of these networks in realistic environments, and discusses new techniques that could be exploited in the future to further enhance the video capacity and quality of user experience.",

      "abstract": "Two related questions emerge from these controversies over the invention and early commercialization of the telegraph. First, how could Morse, a man with little scientific training or mechanical skill, invent the telegraph? Second, how should we apportion credit for the telegraph among Morse, Henry, and Vail?The author's conclusion is clear: Morse was the one who succeeded in reducing the invention of telegraphy in the United States to practice, but he relied on the substantialcontributions to the then-new science of electricity by Henry and the mechanical ingenuity of Vail. Without the help of either one, the Morse telegraph would not have been successful as a commercial system. As another interesting note, the author points out that the Morse code was developed by Morse himself, despite frequent comments that Vail was the one who developed the code.",

      "abstract": "Networking testbeds are a key tool to design and experiment with new protocols, architectures, and services being proposed for future networks. The scenario-based configuration approach is a state-of-the-art testbed configuration mechanism that maximizes productivity in reconfigurable testbeds. However, commonly used scenario specification languages are highly coupled with the underlying testbed technologies. This fact precludes either the reusability of scenarios among different testbeds, or experimentation with complex test scenarios implemented over federated infrastructures proposed in projects like GENI, which comprise a combination of heterogeneous testbeds. In this article these issues are addressed by proposing a novel technology-independent scenario-based testbed configuration management architecture based on model-driven architecture principles. Our proposal takes into account general applicability and extensibility requirements, as well as seamless integration with existing testbeds. Furthermore, it has been experimentally validated with tests performed on actual testbeds.",

      "abstract": "As DDoS attackers pursue monetary profit, critical Internet sites (CISs) become a good target. These attacks will be more difficult to defend because the botnet size continuously increases, and the attackers spare no pains in preparing the attacks. Under this new paradigm, current anti-DDoS systems may be fooled; we need a new survival strategy. We propose a novel DDoS mitigation scheme for CISs. We observe that CISs can continue their main businesses if most important clients can access the services. This motivates us to build a whitelist, called a VIP list in this article, and the source addresses in the list are given higher priority when the CIS is under attack. The VIP list is built from the previous login logs of authentication processes at the application layer. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates DDoS attacks.",

      "abstract": "VLSI realization of video compression is the key to real-time high-definition 3D communication systems. The newly established multiview video coding standard, as an extension profile of H.264/AVC, draws more and more attention for its high compression ratio and free-viewpoint support. Besides providing the 3D experience, multiview video can also give users complete scene perception. However, the multiple-viewpoint throughput requirement of MVC increase the complexity and hardware cost dramatically. The system memory bandwidth, on-chip memory size, and processing data throughput of each module all need to be optimized in an MVC encoder. Therefore, efficient hardware solutions for MVC architecture design are needed. In this article an overview of 3D video coding standards developments and design challenges of an MVC encoder are discussed. Then the algorithm and architecture optimization schemes are proposed. For the trade-off between system memory bandwidth and on-chip memory size, a cache-based prediction engine is proposed to ease both design challenges. Moreover, the hybrid open-close loop intra prediction scheme and the frame-parallel pipeline-doubled dual CABAC solve the throughput requirement problem. At the end of this article, based on all the proposed solutions, a prototype single-chip MVC encoder design with processing ability of 4096 \u00d7 2160 single-view to 1280 \u00d7 720 seven-view is presented.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, a new reality has set in for the semiconductor industry. In a variety of application domains like wireless, multimedia, networking, and automotive, it has become more and more difficult to provide silicon solutions without the associated software executing on the hardware. Not only has software become the key functional differentiator in many areas; its development cycle now determines the overall project success. Market research firm International Business Strategies, Inc. claims that today at 90 nm the typical overall SoC-related development effort for software has already surpassed the effort for hardware. For 45 nm designs in the year 2011, IBS projects that less than 40 percent of the overall development efforts will be spent on hardware. Given the ever growing levels of complexity, traditional approaches to developing embedded software are failing to meet the challenge; a new era of software development has begun in which the majority of embedded software is developed with virtual prototypes, in contrast to traditional software development on hardware boards.",

      "abstract": "NATO has identified Web services standards as a key enabler for interoperability between the different military systems used by various NATO nations. Compared to many civilian systems, military networks vary greatly in terms of computing resources, network bandwidth, mobility and stability, and distributed applications use several different networks concurrently or interact across them. In such dynamic and heterogeneous environments, runtime service discovery is a necessity. According to the W3C, discovery is the act of locating a machine-processable description of a Web service-related resource that may have been previously unknown and that meets certain functional criteria. In this article we present our approach to service discovery, where we combine Web services standards and proprietary solutions using our prototype interoperability gateway. This approach has been experimentally evaluated in a military experiment featuring both mobile ad hoc networks and fixed infrastructure networks, and the results show that transparent discovery between proprietary solutions and Web services discovery standards can be achieved.",

      "abstract": "The rapid performance progress in processors and memory cores by technology scaling requires further improvement in interface bandwidth. However, interface bandwidth is not keeping up with the processing speed of the core and is becoming a bottleneck in system performance. To fill the performance gap, wideband low power low-cost interfaces are strongly demanded. A wireless proximity interface that uses inductive coupling is one such interface expected to be used for interchip links in high-performance 3D system integration. Inductive coupling interfaces use the magnetic near-field induced by micro-coils. The coils (channels) can be arranged in a dense array because magnetic near-field localizes in the proximity of each coil, and crosstalk between the channels is small. Therefore, inductive coupling interfaces are suitable for wideband low-cost proximity communication. An inductive coupling interface can also realize highly reliable communication with low power consumption. Evaluation systems developed to study the performance of inductive coupling interfaces have demonstrated the feasibility of the interfaces in a wide range of applications.",

      "abstract": "The ever increasing volume of air transport necessitates new technologies to be adopted by the flight industry to fulfill the requirements of safety, security, affordability, and environmental friendliness while still meeting the growing demand. What we need to achieve this goal is a new type of aircraft cruise control, interconnecting all the onboard active control systems and making more accurate control decisions than is currently possible, thus improving overall flight efficiency. Active Aircraft envisions such a nervous system of distributed wireless sensor and actuator network components, enabling the early detection of potential problems and quick, accurate reactions to these. As part of this vision, WSANs deployed on aircraft wings help reduce aerodynamic drag and significantly reduce fuel consumption. In this article we first describe this conceptual change in aircraft control technology. We then introduce a WSAN application to reduce skin friction drag and a network topology to enable it. In our application WSANs form virtual flap arrays on the wings to measure the skin friction in real time and to react using synthetic jet actuators, which suck and expel air on the wing to reduce the friction. The Active Aircraft vision imposes stringent performance requirements on the underlying WSAN communication algorithms. The medium access control and routing protocols, in particular, must meet the quality of service criteria set by active control applications. Thus, we also present the application characteristics of Active Aircraft and raise the issue of design considerations with regard to the communication protocols.",

      "abstract": "The following article , by Remi Despres, is the second on the history of X.25 systems to appear in this column. As noted by Dr. Despres, the previous article focused on the Canadian Datapac system. Earlier articles on packet switching in this column have included one on the history of the Arpanet/Internet and one on early British packet switching systems. What makes this article particularly distinctive, aside, of course, from the fact that it focuses on the major contributions of French engineers to the development of packet switching as well as to X.25 standardization, is that it carefully outlines the reasons for the choice of connection-oriented virtual circuits for the Transpac network, as contrasted with datagram-based packet switching adopted for Arpanet. Interestingly, Dr. Despres notes that the idea of using virtual-circuit connection-oriented packet switching in the Transpac development came from the British packet switching activity. It is to be noted that early commercial packet switching networks in the United States, such as Tymnet and Telenet, also adopted the virtual circuit paradigm.",

In the German project sim<sup>TD</sup>,<sup>1</sup> car-to-x communication is shifting from a pure research topic toward a first deployment of such a system: the goal of sim<sup>TD</sup> is to test car-to-x applications in a real metropolitan field trial. The sim<sup>TD</sup> scenario includes vehicles, roadside units, and infrastructural facilities for traffic and test management. Besides these domains, several third parties are involved to provide access to additional services. The main communication partners are furthermore distributed over a wide area including highway, suburban, and urban scenarios. As a result, such a system requires a commonly accepted architecture of the individual components and a seamless communication network for reliable and efficient information interchange. In this article we propose the sim<sup>TD</sup> system architecture and the components necessary for successful deployment in the large-scale field trial.",
