      "abstract": "This article describes the design and implementation of a unique cooperative agents testbed aimed at addressing diverse applications for the difficult problem of seamless personal information networking (SPIN). The real-world SPIN testbed is aimed at two difficult applications. Namely seamless messaging and intelligent network management. Both applications are agent-driven and share agent behavior, and the messaging agents rely on the network management device diagnostic agents for input. The article introduces both problem areas in a common testbed. The first-generation seamless messaging application is described in detail. User-centric seamless messaging assumes heterogeneous communication environments intended to support today's nomadic users. The prototype is introduced for the management of messages across distributed information networks. Its aim is to intercept, filter, interpret, and deliver multimodal messages, be they voice, fax, video, and/or e-mail messages. A user's personal communication agent is charged with delivering messages to the recipient regardless of their target messaging device-a telephone, pager, desktop, wireless laptop, or wireless phone. Personal communication agents classify and act on incoming messages based on their content. A secretary agent routes and tailors urgent messages appropriately to the device manager agent, which delivers the message to a device on which the user may be roaming or active. What makes the seamless messaging application unique is its approach to treating a message in a universal manner, and its ability to mediate between different messaging environments and devices, and to try to track and find the user.",

      "abstract": "Network synchronization, at first unknown and considered irrelevant to the operation and performance of telecommunications networks, has played an increasingly important role throughout the evolution of telecommunications, especially since transmission and switching became digital. This survey deals with telecommunications network synchronization from a historical point of view, aiming to show how network synchronization issues have evolved with telephone networks over the last 30 years, beginning with old FDM networks up to the latest technologies through PDH, SDH/SONET, and ATM. For each case, the different synchronization needs and the peculiar techniques of timing transfer and distribution are pointed out, thus providing a comprehensive overview of the evolution steps of telecommunications network synchronization.",

      "abstract": "The telecom business is due for fundamental changes, concerning both technology and enterprise-but also concerning attitudes. This article discusses the merger between telecom and datacom, the business and technological trends-in order to outline future architecture for service and infrastructure. Our approach is that the causes of change are more fundamental than is normally conceived. Today the telecom community focuses on deregulation and competition, rather than observing that there will be different types of traffic dominating our networks -and businesses. We also tend to focus on broadband technology, rather than observing that the emerging services require online properties and a connectionless network. Our own attitude, to interpret new phenomena in telecommunications concepts, disables us from using new technology and understanding new business. An overall conclusion is, in sweeping terms, that our operations in the future will be dominated by datacom networks rather than telecom networks. This, in turn, requires a new scenario for interoperability and regulations-and calls for new business models. It is argued that the focus for regulations should be interoperability rather than infrastructure. Furthermore, a generic \"hour-glass\" architecture is sketched-assuming, for example, IP as the interoperability level separating the megabits per second market from the service market. The discussion in this article reflects one strand of strategic discourse on future networks within Telia and other European operators.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of distributed multimedia applications exhibiting significantly more stringent quality of service requirements than conventional data-oriented applications calls for new transport protocols with different characteristics to coexist and be integrated within single applications. The different delivery requirements posed by these diverse multimedia applications often imply the need for highly customized protocol implementations. Hence, application developers are faced with the threat of code obsolescence caused by the development of even newer delivery techniques. We present an object-oriented transport architecture that allows for dynamically binding a variety of protocol stacks on a per-call basis. By binding protocol stacks together, the special needs of the application can be met without the need to rewrite the code. This differs significantly from the traditional transport architecture which assumes preinstalled transport protocol stacks that cannot be customized.

The architecture of such a LAN is presented in this article. Emphasis is placed on the protocol stacks of the model to provide seamless operation with the wired network, on the cellular topology, and on the MAC protocol. Under the proposed topology the system performance is revealed in terms of packet dropping probability, average access delay, channel throughput, and statistical multiplexing gain for a range of system parameters.",

      "abstract": "Network design is a compromise between two conflicting requirements: high network efficiency and high quality of service (QoS). High efficiency suggests full sharing of network resources. However, in a multiclass network, QoS differentiation among several traffic classes suggests traffic segregation and resource partitioning. High efficiency in a partitioned network can be realized by elastic time-varying partitioning of the network capacity. The network can be laterally divided into bands, and each band may be reconfigured frequently, under the constraint of the fixed total capacity. Rapid partitioning is facilitated by two main developments: the capability of high-speed transfer of control data, and the ease of dynamic partitioning of link capacity. This article describes how elastic network bands are used to realize an efficient network serving heterogeneous traffic. It also discusses the intraband management of independent connections and reserved end-to-end paths so that the connection-request processing load is reduced while a high transport-capacity utilization is maintained.",

The key to realizing this potential is the development and deployment of high-performance radio systems. In this article we describe a basic service concept, advanced cellular Internet service (ACIS), and the technologies for achieving reliable high-speed transmission to wide-area mobile and portable cellular subscribers with very high spectrum efficiency. Such a wireless service, optimized to meet the needs of a client-server model for information retrieval and Web browsing, and combined with evolutionary enhancements in second-generation technologies, can provide an attractive option for third-generation systems. The radio link design combines OFDM with transmit and receive antenna diversity and Reed-Solomon coding to overcome the link budget and dispersive fading limitations of the cellular mobile radio environment. For access, a dynamic packet assignment algorithm is proposed which combines rapid interference measurements, priority ordering, and a staggered frame assignment schedule to provide spectrum efficiencies of two-to-four times existing approaches.",

Solutions to such problems include passing tasks to others or agent migration to remote hosts. We propose agent cloning as a more comprehensive approach to the problem of local agent overloads. Agent cloning subsumes task transfer and agent mobility. According to our paradigm, agents may clone, pass tasks to others, die, or merge. We discuss the requirements of implementing a cloning mechanism and its benefits in a multi-agent system, and support our claims with simulation results.",

The computer industry provides a great model for widespread deployment of advanced technology with the government acting as a referee to ensure competitive service provision.

We discuss the goals and requirements for building a \"measurement infrastructure\" for the Internet, in which a collection of measurement \"platforms\" cooperatively measure the properties of Internet paths and clouds by exchanging test traffic among themselves. The key emphasis of the architecture, which forms the underpinnings of the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI) project, is on tackling problems related to scale. Consequently, the architecture emphasizes decentralized control of measurements; strong authentication and security; mechanisms for both maintaining tight administrative control over who can perform what measurements using which platforms, and delegation of some forms of measurement as a site's measurement policy permits; and simple configuration and maintenance of platforms.",

      "abstract": "In response to the explosive increase in the number of mobile subscribers and the ever stronger demand for mobile multimedia services, the authors propose introducing the ATM technique for next-generation mobile network infrastructures in order to handle a high volume of traffic and develop multimedia communications. First, this article clarifies mobile-specific requirements for and advantages of applying ATM to mobile infrastructure networks. However, it is risky for network operators en bloc to replace the conventional STM-based infrastructure by ATM. Therefore, this article shows a smooth evolution path for the mobile network infrastructure to convert from conventional STM to ATM as mobile multimedia services mature. Even in future mobile networks, the main traffic may still be voice communications, whose bit rate is too low for efficient use of the radio frequency band. Applying ATM to such very-low-bit-rate mobile voice streams is inefficient due to the delay in filling out the payload of an ATM cell; this \"packetization delay\" degrades the quality of service. This problem can be solved by using a layered cell structure for the mobile ATM network. This cell structure enables the efficient transfer of voice signals ranging from very-low-bit-rate signals to high-speed multimedia signals with little delay. Standardization of this cell structure is progressing in ITU-T and the ATM Forum. Transmission efficiency is estimated by simulation.",

A meshed network with dynamically adjustable link capacities and nodes which provide data packing into \"containers\" for transport is proposed. A ring-based network, exchanging data containers among its nodes, is the preferred implementation due to its flexibility, maintainability, and high reliability. With lossless rings, the quality of service is controlled solely by the origin and destination nodes, without any interference from other data streams. Flexible programmable transport greatly improves the performance, simplifies the controls, and facilitates scalability. The concept is a departure from classical network thinking. By reducing the complexity of the network core, an economical, reliable, and manageable network with feature-rich edge nodes can be realized. An architecture with recursive ring-based structures provides a high degree of flexibility in bandwidth allocation and is compatible with current transport networks and future all-optical networks.",

      "abstract": "Wavelength routing can be performed in the optical domain for both long-haul and passive optical networks. Arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) can perform wavelength routing for a large number of optical channels and provide a high level of functionality on an integrated chip. The AWG guides light on a planar lightwave circuit into an array of waveguides that provide dispersion to separate the different wavelengths of light. Routing functions can be performed on individual wavelengths. With this technology, optical cross-connects, optical add/drop multiplexers, and passive optical routers have been demonstrated. Performance issues-such as insertion loss, polarization dependence, passband shape, passband position, crosstalk, and temperature dependence-are being addressed so that AWGs will be practical for deployment into systems.",

      "abstract": "With the transformation of the Internet into a commercial infrastructure, the ability to provide differentiated services to users with widely varying requirements is rapidly becoming as important as meeting the massive increases in bandwidth demand. Hence, while deploying routers, switches, and transmission systems of ever increasing capacity, Internet service providers would also like to provide customer-specific differentiated services using the same shared network infrastructure. We describe router architectures that can support the two trends of rising bandwidth demand and rising demand for differentiated services. We focus on router mechanisms that can support differentiated services at a level not contemplated in proposals currently under consideration due to concern regarding their implementability at high speeds. We consider the types of differentiated services that service providers may want to offer and then discuss the mechanisms needed in routers to support them. We describe plausible implementations of these mechanisms (the scalability and performance of which have been demonstrated by implementation in a prototype system) and argue that it is technologically possible to considerably raise the level of differentiated services which service providers can offer their customers, and that it is not necessary to restrict differentiated services to rudimentary offerings even in very-high-speed networks.",

The misuse of these and other terms can lead to low-balled cost proposals, court litigation, and patent infringement cases.

      "abstract": "The rapid pace of technology introduction in the network infrastructure and services offered on this infrastructure are creating new challenges for telecommunication product and network planners. In particular, a multitude of choices, the unpredictability of future technologies and traffic, the need to operate heterogeneous networks, and the speed of change create a need for a set of tools which allow quantitative evaluation of alternatives quickly in early phases of decision making while allowing the same tools to migrate to more elaborate deployment help during the later stages. We have begun an effort to create such a set of tools under the umbrella of integrated network design tools (INDT). In this article, we describe key challenges and approaches used in INDT to meet these challenges. We also discuss the algorithmic and software architecture of INDT, and illustrate its use via examples from transport infrastructure evolution. Finally, we describe the migration path of INDT to move from early decision help to later deployment support tools. Specific topics discussed include: plesiosynchronous digital hierarchy, SONET/SDH systems, ATM, network topologies, traffic types and routing.",

      "abstract": "A much clearer picture of the progress toward an integrated high-speed multiservice network is now emerging. Such networks were anticipated over 20 years ago, at a time when packet switching was just another way to transmit data. Now the technology is so mature that media barons are organizing their investments in order to take advantage of its profitability. Many of the technical problems are now solved, and the fundamental protocols required for these networks are sufficiently well-defined to support a rapidly expanding industry. However, consensus on how to talk about the statistics of the data transmitted around these networks has not been readily forthcoming. Nevertheless, there now exists a family of models with sufficient richness to describe real traffic fairly well, which can be parameterized conveniently, and which degenerates to a readily analyzable Gaussian model in the situation of very large networks. This analysis leads to important architectural conclusions which accord with common sense, in particular the conclusion that integrated networks of the future should be able to provide better and better service with efficiency tending toward perfection. This is a rather happy conclusion which thoroughly confirms the current rapid drive toward an all-encompassing integrated multiservice network. Rather than the increase in traffic and diversity of service types leading to greater and greater complexity, it seems that the flow of traffic in our networks may become steadily more manageable.",

      "abstract": "A number of emerging broadband services require the ability to manage multiple parties and/or media. For instance, broadband videoconferencing bridges together more than two parties. A telemedicine service could enable doctors to converse over bidirectional video and audio connections, and share X-rays and patient data over unidirectional data connections. To manage the complexity of multiple parties and media, a rigorous model of the connectivity of a call is essential. Furthermore, an application-level protocol is needed so that a broadband service may request changes to the connectivity. A promising object-oriented model and protocol is at the heart of the connection view state approach. This approach was created to enable call party handling, which may be defined as \"intelligent network control of stable calls with two or more parties\". The ITU-T has standardized this approach for narrowband calls. Extensions to the connection view state approach have been proposed to support broadband services.",

      "abstract": "The Japanese telecommunications market has experienced drastic changes since the privatization of NTT and the introduction of competition in 1985. Rate reduction in long distance services has been remarkable, and NTT's revenue share in the long distance market has declined sharply. The growth in mobile services and Internet services are epoch-making, and POTS is showing signs of decline. Behind the scenes is the progress of deregulation in remedying the distortion in the market structure. The establishment of new interconnection rules and the reorganization of NTT into one long distance company and two regional companies are the most important outcomes. With this deregulation the Japanese telecommunications industry is expected to develop from managed competition to full competition. However, new challenges for telecommunications regulation are emerging with the progress of competition and new multimedia services. One of them is the universal service. Cooperation among regulators, operators, users, and scholars is required to accommodate the change.",

      "abstract": "Single-carrier modulation such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or carrierless amplitude modulation-phase modulation (CAP), and DMT are alternative techniques for providing digital communication in a variety of applications, in particular ADSL for communication over the telephone company subscriber lines. Although theory predicts comparable performance under ideal implementations, a definitive comparison of performance over a wide range of conditions will require more experience from field trials. Similarly, accurate comparison of implementation costs must await the greater availability of commercial-grade devices. However, enough is now known about these modulation schemes to compare their inherent similarities and differences in performance and cost. Overall, a present view of single-carrier and multitone modulation indicates comparable performance with some differences depending on the type of degradation. Costs should also be approximately equal, with multitone having some advantage in digital processing, but requiring greater cost in analog circuitry.",

      "abstract": "The Internet has developed into a global data network that is highly accepted as a multimedia information platform which has the potential to develop into an alternative carrier network in the future. Telecom operators increasingly act as Internet service providers to maximize network utilization, to attract or retain customers, and to generate additional revenue. To leverage their installed base in the PSTN/ISDN the optimal strategy for telco ISPs is the integration of their point of presence into the central office packetizing and grooming of IP traffic in the local office relieves load on the PSTN/ISDN trunk network, resolves existing bottlenecks due to Internet traffic upstream of the CO, and creates new opportunities for revenue-generating features for both telephony and Internet subscribers. This article shows that current telecommunication network elements can be upgraded with innovate cutting-edge technology to build a solid basis for a seamless multimedia network of tomorrow, thereby enabling telecom operators' and service providers' tremendous investment in existing network infrastructure to be fully utilized. An integrated Internet services platform is presented which turns the CO switch into an optimized link between the PSTN/ISDN and the Internet. Technically, it is proposed that the central office be expanded with an integrated Internet PoP (IPOP) configured from the following IP components: an internal high-speed data backbone (ATM or Ethernet); modem pools to terminate dial-in calls from analog modems using the PPP protocol; protocol handlers for UDP, TCP, IP, and lower-layer data protocols (X.25, frame relay, SMDS, etc.); access to data networks; IP router, RADIUS server, and name server database; a contents server (optionally), enabling telco ISPs to become content providers. This effectively turns the CO into an Internet access point that integrates smoothly into the existing telco OA&amp;M/TMN. The IP functions integrated in the IPOP can interwork closely with PSTN/ISDN call processing.",

The article first defines a reasonable set of functional requirements and design criteria for an image copyright labeling system, and then describes a labeling method using a JPEG model-based, frequency-hopped, randomly sequenced pulse position modulated code (RSPPMC). Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed method meets the requirements for copyright protection, including the robustness of an embedded label against several damaging possibilities such as lossy data compression, low-pass filtering, and color space conversion, as well as printing/scanning, scaling, and cropping.",

It includes the second-generation digital mobile communications, R&amp;D and standardization activities related to IMT-2000, and the authors' perspectives on IMT-2000 in Korea. In Korea, there are many activities for development of IMT-2000 radio transmission technologies, and the results of these activities will be the submission of technologies to the ITU. However, the Korean telecommunications standardization body (TTA) will make every effort to make a common global standard for IMT-2000. Therefore, the TTA will make a domestic standard for IMT-2000 after the ITU finalizes the related Recommendations. It seems to the authors that difficulties in harmonization in the TTA are very similar to difficulties in harmonization worldwide. The only way of reaching the harmonization of IMT-2000 in Korea is that the key players should have the view from the end users' seat.",

Its published specifications, DAVIC 1.0-1.4, are backward compatible and form the foundation for commercial interactive multimedia experiences. Each specification is market-driven and developed where possible in close synergy with the products and work in progress of other standards-developing organizations. In addition, DAVIC 1.3.1 has been submitted as a Draft International Standard to ISO/IEC JTC 1 in order to establish this industry specification as a recognized international standard and to contribute to the international standards community. DAVIC's future goals are clear, and significant progress is being made on achieving TV anytime/anywhere as the next stage to full interactive multimedia services.",

      "abstract": "Exponential advances in telecommunications and computer technology are driving the United States and the world into the information age, an age of instantaneous and massive communication all over the world. The rapid pace of new technology has made the old concept of the franchised telephone monopoly obsolete-an obsolescence confirmed and hastened by the 1996 Telecommunications Act. However, the new environment has also made traditional modes of telecommunications regulation obsolete. In this article, the authors argue that, in many key areas, regulators are actually standing in the way of delivery of the information age to many Americans. Traditional regulation has long controlled such key aspects of a regulated telephone company's operations as the introduction of new services and the price at which services must be offered to the public. These regulations, as applied to the last remaining heavily regulated telecommunications firms, the local exchange carriers, have reached the point where they are now counterproductive and anti-investment. Particularly in the world of data communications, where everything is new, regulators should strive to reduce regulatory burdens in order that the market forces which new technologies are unleashing can bring benefits to the entire public.",

With delegated agents, management intelligence can be dynamically embedded in elements and domains so that networked systems can be programmed to be self-managed.",

Alongside the improvement in the WDM components there has been continuing development of WDMA networks. A large number of different WDMA strategies have been investigated in terms of both network architecture and the associated protocol requirements. This article identifies major themes and provides examples of experimental and theoretical developments which are anticipated to facilitate WDMA networking.",

The DPIM code properties are discussed, and expressions for the transmission capacity, power spectrum, and error probability are presented. We show that for a given number of bits per symbol, DPIM has a higher transmission capacity, a similar spectral profile, and only a marginally inferior error probability performance compared with pulse position modulation, and is rather less complex to implement. Finally, problems associated with the nonuniform symbol length characteristics of DPIM together with possible solutions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "A new kind of \"wireless video\" is currently entering consumers' homes-digital television. The term digital video broadcasting (DVB) is used as a synonym for digital television in many countries of the world. Whereas one may tend to think that digital television means just a new, digital, form of signal representation not necessarily affecting the information content of what one has always called TV, the truth is that digital television becomes multiple-channel data broadcasting. This article reviews some of the results of the work in the worldwide DVB Project and explains some of the fundamental concepts behind the work of this group. It then concentrates on the terrestrial transmission system (DVB-T) as one example of the many transmission technologies DVB has developed over the last few years. The COFDM modulation scheme which is a key ingredient of DVB-T is described in some detail. The performance of the system is presented. The use of DVB for data broadcasting and the accompanying return channel technologies are explained.",

      "abstract": "In the past, each new network element of a wireless network had a corresponding management system to provide management capabilities. Each of these management systems had a different user interface, employed a different computing platform, and typically managed one type of network element. The total O&amp;M system was the sum of these independent resources, consuming partial solutions that made network management tasks inefficient, complex, time consuming, and expensive to administer. Large operations costs borne from these inefficiencies were once buffered by large cellular operator profits. With the introduction of PCS, operators became extremely cost conscious and sought to eradicate these large costs. Additionally, wireless service providers moved into a mixed vendor environment, where network elements manufactured by several vendors are used, so they could no longer afford different management systems for each network element. In today's environment, a wireless service provider who can provide better service quality at the lowest price will be the ultimate winner. The key to providing better service quality at the lowest price is to have efficient network management. As the wireless industry strives to push wireless prices on a par with wireline, the necessity for reduced network operation and management costs takes on increasing importance.",

This article explains what distributed object technology is and what it does for networks and communication services. It describes the current key technologies in this field, the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), and gives examples of networking architectures, such as TINA and TMN, that utilize these technologies. Finally, this article introduces a simplified model for a CORBA-based networking architecture that facilitates open network interfaces and provides a generic platform for services of the future.",

To achieve this goal, new system design concepts with increased system capacity will be required. In that context, ATM is becoming a major infrastructure, receiving a lot of attention for telecommunication systems since ATM networks can most effectively support wireless access systems. Wireless ATM systems have low transmission cost, flexible functionality, mobile ATM protocol, and radio access layer protocols. This article overviews the various wireless broadband systems studied at 5, 19.37, 40, and 60 GHz by European Union funded projects within the ACTS program. Moreover, related standardization activities and network evolution are also addressed.",

      "abstract": "In order to be competitive, telecommunications service providers need new technologies that facilitate the rapid introduction of validated services in a cost-effective manner. Service engineering is a new discipline in which the telecommunications sector addresses the technologies and engineering processes required for service creation. Concurrent with these studies the development of applications in the Internet shows a new way to design telecommunications services based on the mobile agent paradigm. This brings new concepts that fit the requirements of service engineering. Therefore merging the approaches enables improvement of the service creation process. We illustrate this by presenting a framework for the formal design of telecommunications services using mobile agent technology complemented with formal methods. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, it relies on the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) and shows how to adapt its concepts to agent orientation. Second, it provides agent-based service designers with validation and verification tools to state the quality of their specifications.",

      "abstract": "Transport networks are facing new challenges and opportunities because of the explosive growth of data traffic. Besides having to meet the ever-increasing bandwidth demand, transport networks need to provide new functionalities for the support of data applications. For example, they should provide elastic data pipes which guarantee minimum bandwidths but also allow expansion when extra bandwidth is available. They should support instant and automatic discovery and configuration of layer 3 nodes which, traditionally, is possible only for LANs. Enhanced transport systems with inherent packet multiplexing can meet these challenges. It will be natural to use Internet protocols and technologies to implement these packet transport systems, and thereby reuse much of the existing Internet infrastructure already widely deployed.",

      "abstract": "Australia is at the forefront of developing spectrum management techniques for the provision of flexible access to radio communications spectrum under a new form of licensing called \"spectrum licensing\". Spectrum licenses have already been issued in the 500 MHz band, and auctions are being held in 1998 for spectrum lots in the 800 MHz and 1.8 GHz bands. Licensees manage their own spectrum space defined in terms of a frequency band and a geographic area for a fixed license term. The Regulator maintains a level of regulation just sufficient to keep significant levels of emission within those licenses so that spectrum utility is not reduced by either an unacceptable rate of interference or fear of litigation. No channeling plan is employed, and the spectrum may be used for any type of radio communications service. New terms such as \"horizontally radiated power\", \"device boundary\", and \"level of protection\" have been coined to describe fresh approaches to interference management that take advantage of the capabilities of geographic information systems. The interference management framework is dynamic, and designed to evolve on the basis of both practical experience and requirements of licensees.",

MPLS uses the technique of packet forwarding based on labels, to enable the implementation of a simpler high-performance packet forwarding engine. This also decouples packet forwarding from routing, facilitating the provision of varied routing services independent of the packet forwarding paradigm. The authors track the evolution of this technology in relation to other existing technologies. Then an overview of the MPLS architecture and design is provided. In addition, some of the work that was a precursor to MPLS is discussed, as well as related issues and debates.",

      "abstract": "Existing IS-95-based CDMA systems support circuit-mode and packet-mode data services at a data rate limited to 9.6-14.4 kb/s. Fueled by the explosive growth of the Internet, applications and market opportunities are demanding that higher capacity, higher data rates, and advanced multimedia services be supported in the near future. The evolution of the IS-95 CDMA standard to higher data rates and more advanced services occurs in two steps. The first step, IS-95-B, is an enhancement to the IS-95-A standard and offers the highest possible performance without breaking current IS-95-A air interface design characteristics, thereby maintaining strict compatibility with existing base station hardware. The proposed standard will support a high data rate (64 kb/s) in both directions, to and from the mobile device. A new burst mode packet data service is defined to allow better interference management and capacity utilization. The second evolution step, cdma2000, provides next-generation capacity, data rates, and services. The cdma2000 system includes a greatly enhanced air interface supporting CDMA over wider bandwidths for improved capacity and higher data rates while also maintaining backward compatibility with existing IS-95 CDMA end-user devices. The cdma2000 system also includes a sophisticated MAC feature to effectively support very-high-data-rate services (up to 2 Mb/s) and multiple concurrent data and voice services. This article describes the design and performance of the high-data-rate service provided by second- and third-generation CDMA systems.",

Accordingly, allocation of network resources based on different priority levels is becoming a realistic possibility. Thus, we need new methods for connection admission control and capacity planning that take account of the priority structure. We show that the notion of effective bandwidths can be used for these purposes when appropriately extended. The key is to have admissibility of a set of connections determined by a linear constraint for each priority level, involving a performance criterion for each priority level. For this purpose, connections are assigned more than one effective bandwidth, one for its own priority level and one for each lower priority level. Candidate effective bandwidths for each priority level can be determined by using previous methods associated with the first-in first-out discipline.

      "abstract": "The authors provide an overview of techniques that enable the use of ITU-T recommendation H.324 with error-prone transmission channels. H.324 covers the overall architecture, algorithms, and syntax for low-bit-rate multimedia terminals. This overview focuses on extensions for error-resilient video transmission that are related to the H.263 video codec and H.223 multiplex. The latter is responsible for reliable delivery of data to each terminal component and is therefore of major importance to the overall system. In particular, the discussed approaches to robust video transmission require reliable performance of the multiplex scheme. The considered techniques for video coding are either compatible with the baseline mode of H.263 or part of new extensions recently devised by Study Group 16 as part of the H.263+ effort. This overview includes \"error tracking\" (Appendix II). \"reference picture selection\" (Annex N), and \"independent segment decoding\" (Annex R). Whenever appropriate, the description of those video extensions and multiplex schemes is complemented with simulation results for transmission over Rayleigh fading channels.",

      "abstract": "ATM offers the capability of consolidating multiple services onto a common backbone network, thereby reducing network management complexity, improving utilization, and lowering cost. As ATM networks grow, a virtual path connection (VPC) network core is often provisioned to reduce the number of connections to provide scalability for network management and performance. Provisioning a VPC network core raises a number of issues, especially related to the performance of bursty non-real-time connections. This article discusses these issues and how the functionality of ATM can best address them. It is shown that employing low-loss flow-controlled ABR VPCs to carry non-real-time traffic can provide significant gains in terms of performance as well as improved throughput for a given amount of buffering in the network core. The flow-controlled VPC enables the complexities of virtual channel connection- (VCC)-level congestion control, fairness, and isolation to be pushed to the network edge where lower speeds allow this functionality to be performed more cost effectively.",

However, a new field of research called \"personal imaging\" has emerged. Personal imaging systems are based on wireless video technology, and are typically characterized by video from a first-person perspective by way of a head-mounted camera and display together with an image processing computer worn on the body of the user. The possibilities afforded by personal imaging include a personal safely device for crime reduction, a new kind of video conferencing system for computer-supported collaboration, as well as a new tool for photojournalism. This article describes work in personal imaging as it has evolved over the past 20 years, and then sets forth a future vision for wireless video in a head-mounted context. Most notably, the notion of computer-supported collaborative wireless video is presented.",

The results of a research project called IBIS carried out within the CoRiTeL Laboratory are presented. The IBIS project starts from the activities of the ACTS project INSIGNIA, which has proposed and demonstrated an architecture for the integration of the intelligent network concept over B-ISDN platforms (the so-called intelligent broadband network, IBN). In the IBIS approach, TINA service components replace the traditional IN service logic, providing the intelligence needed to control broadband services in a very flexible and open environment. The handling of the transport connections is performed in a more traditional way, exploiting the capability offered by the IBN. This article focuses on how the TINA and IBN paradigms can profitably interact, providing the intelligence to support advanced multimedia services.",

      "abstract": "ATM is a widespread technology adopted by many operators to support advanced data communication, in particular efficient Internet services provision. The expected challenges of multimedia communication together with the increasing massive utilization of IP-based applications urgently require redesign of networking solutions in terms of both new functionalities and enhanced performance. An approach based on finding out the best match between realistic service requirements and the pragmatic, intelligent use of technical opportunities made available by the product market seems appropriate. With the aim of pursuing feasible innovations in the different networking aspects, at CSELT we are investigating a few of the most crucial topics related to the IP and ATM integration perspective. In particular, we are developing research concerning efficient multicasting for conferences and TV over the net, service integration and quality control, as well as high performance and enhanced routing. After a survey of the state of the art, the article reports the most significant results so far achieved by CSELT in advanced networking. With reference to multicasting, the article illustrates field experience managing complex MBone conference configurations over ATM and preliminary laboratory results dealing with IP/ATM integrated multicasting. In the service integration area, measurements are illustrated concerning RSVP over ATM that show the benefits of resources allocation for QoS support when different traffic types are mixed. Integration of IP and ATM is then discussed by introducing experimental results one is able to improve the routing and switching capabilities, starting from the many solutions currently proposed at the international level. A significant investigation area is the introduction of a \"feature programmability\" function within network elements, in order to augment service flexibility. Enhanced routing is illustrated as an example of programmable features that will be feasible with advanced networking platforms.",

      "abstract": "We discuss two modifications to the design of wireless infrared links that can yield significant performance improvements, albeit at the price of increased complexity. In line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links, replacement of a single-element receiver by one employing an imaging light concentrator and a segmented photodetector can reduce received ambient light noise and multipath distortion. For a fixed receiver entrance area, such an imaging receiver can reduce transmit power requirements by as much as about 14 dB, depending on the link design and the number of photodetector segments. Imaging receivers also reduce co-channel interference, and may therefore enable infrared wireless networks to employ space-division multiplexing, wherein several transmitters located in close proximity can transmit simultaneously at the same wavelength. In nondirected non-line-of-sight links, replacement of the diffuse transmitter by one that projects multiple narrow beams can reduce the path loss, further reducing the transmit power requirement by several decibels. We describe the design of an experimental 100 Mb/s infrared wireless link employing a multibeam transmitter and a 37-pixel imaging receiver.",

      "abstract": "As the number and variety of Web- and network-based applications continues to increase, so does the need for flexible communication protocols and services to support them. Traditionally, a major impediment to deployment of new protocols and services is the need to upgrade millions of end systems with compatible implementations. At the same time, Java-a language explicitly designed to support development and distribution of new applications via the Web-is emerging as a (potentially) ubiquitous system platform. It is therefore natural to consider whether Java might speed the introduction of protocols to better support new applications. We discuss the suitability of Java as an environment for implementing and deploying communication protocols. Using insights from a Java-based protocol suite and supporting protocol subsystem we have implemented, we describe the benefits of using Java for protocol development and deployment, and how protocol programmers can implement protocols taking advantage of those benefits.",

      "abstract": "Locating mobile objects in a worldwide system requires a scalable location service. An object can be a telephone or a notebook computer, but also a software or data object, such as a file or an electronic document. Our service strictly separates an object's name from the addresses where it can be contacted. This is done by introducing a location-independent object handle. An object's name is bound to its unique object handle, which, in turn, is mapped to the addresses where the object can be contacted. To locate an object, we need only its object handle. We present a scalable location service based on a worldwide distributed search tree that adapts dynamically to an object's migration pattern to optimize lookups and updates.",

      "abstract": "In many DSP-based high-speed modem applications, such as broadband modems for high-speed Internet access to the home or gigabit Ethernet transceivers, channel equalization requires processing power so high that power consumption and clock speed become major design challenges. This article describes techniques to implement low-cost adaptive equalizers for ASIC implementations of broadband modems. Power consumption can be reduced using a careful selection of architectural, algorithmic, and VLSI circuit techniques. The derivation of a hybrid FIR filter structure is given that enables the designer to adjust both the speed and power consumption to suit an application. Furthermore, the architecture can be made programmable to target multiple applications in one piece of silicon while maintaining or even improving the efficiency of the architecture. Run-time techniques are shown that can minimize the power consumption for a given application or operating environment. In all cases, the power reduction techniques are supported by simulations and measurements made on a test integrated circuit.",

The discussion focuses on the architectural and circuit techniques developed specifically for silicon integration of high-performance low-power wireless video systems. The proposed single-chip digital camera incorporates a parallel architecture to perform MPEG-2 encoding in real time, while the video-on-demand system employs an error-resilient compression algorithm to guard against the transmission errors often encountered in wireless communication. Both wireless video systems, one for encoding and the other for decoding, dissipate only tens of milliwatts of power, achieving a power reduction two orders of magnitude below standard solutions.",

      "abstract": "The practicality of mobile agents hinges on realistic security techniques. Mobile agent systems are combination client/servers that transport, and provide an interface with host computers for, mobile agents. Transport of mobile agents takes place between mobile agent systems, which are located on heterogeneous platforms, making up an infrastructure that has the potential to scale to the size of any underlying network. Mobile agents can be rapidly deployed, and can respond to each other and their environment. These abilities expose flaws in current security technology. This article surveys the risks connected with the use of mobile agents, and security techniques available to protect mobile agents and their hosts. The inadequacies of the security techniques developed from the information fortress model are identified. They are the result of using a good model in an inappropriate context (i.e. a closed system model in a globally distributed networking computing base). Problems with commercially available techniques include: (1) conflicts between security techniques protecting hosts and mobile agents, (2) inability to handle multiple collaborative mobile agents, and (3) emphasis on the credentials of software instead of on the integrity of software to determine the level of trust.",

      "abstract": "On the road to the future success of mobile agents, we believe that interagent communication is an issue that has not been adequately addressed by the mobile agents community. Supplementing mobile agents with the ability to interact with other mobile or static agents, or agentified information sources is a necessity in the vastly heterogeneous arena in which mobile agents are called to compete. Thus, an agent communication language should be interpreted as a tool with the capacity to integrate disparate sources of information. We argue that mobile agents can benefit from current standards efforts on agent communication since the focus of such work is to address heterogeneity by defining a \"common language\" for communicating agents. We discuss ongoing research on agent-to-agent communication and present current standards efforts relevant to agent communication.",

      "abstract": "The anticipated increase in popular use of the Internet will create more opportunities in distance learning, electronic commerce, and multimedia communication, but it will also create more challenges in organizing information and facilitating its efficient retrieval. From the network perspective, there will be additional challenges and problems in meeting bandwidth requirements and network management. Many researchers believed that the mobile agent paradigm (mobile object) could propose several attractive solutions to deal with such challenges and problems. A number of mobile agent systems have been designed and implemented in academic institutions and commercial firms. However, few applications were found to take advantage of the mobile agent. Among the hurdles facing this emerging paradigm are concerns about security requirements and efficient resource management. This article introduces the core concepts of this emerging paradigm, and presents an account of current research efforts in the context of telecommunications. The goal is to provide the interested reader with a clear background of the opportunities and challenges this emerging paradigm brings about, and a descriptive look at some of the forerunners that are providing experimental technologies supporting this paradigm.",

This article outlines two schemes for supporting mobility of IP terminals in this network. In the first scheme, location management and handoff support is integrated within the ATM signaling and control framework (\"mobile ATM\"), and mobility is transparently supported at the IP layer by mobile ATM underneath. In the second approach, the IP protocol stack is directly executed on ATM switches (without an intermediate ATM signaling stack) using an IP switching technique called IPSOFACTO (IP Switching Over Fast ATM Cell Transport), and terminal mobility is supported via mobile IP.",

An MFL consists of an array of N optical amplifiers monolithically integrated with a 1/spl times/N optical multiplexer. The laser provides the functionality of N independent lasers whose optical wavelengths are precisely locked together by the common intracavity optical multiplexer. The design of an MFL together with its fundamental characteristics are discussed, and state-of-the-art results are shown. The functionality of an MFL is compared to that of an integrated DFB array. Finally, we show some applications of single-wavelength tunable transmitters and multiwavelength transmitters.",

A number of air interface technologies, such as GSM, TDMA and CDMA, are available to wireless service providers for offering wireless services. In addition, a variety of networking technologies, such as STM, ATM and frame relay, are available to the wireless services provider for designing their infrastructure networks. The abundant choice of technologies, and their associated capabilities and costs, creates a need for network design tools which can help vendors and wireless service providers to understand the economics of investing in different technologies. This article is concerned with the design of narrowband and broadband infrastructure networks for wireless access. The article first describes the different technology alternatives and tariff structures and their impact on wireless infrastructure network design. The general infrastructure design problem is then stated and a solution methodology outlined. Examples of the economic trade-offs involved in narrowband and broadband networking technologies are also presented.",

      "abstract": "Most current computer applications are insensitive to changing network conditions. With the growing demand for wireless, satellite, and other highly volatile computer communications networks, however, applications that are robust in the presence of network volatility must be designed and built. Network-robust applications are of great interest in military situations today, and we expect that interest to grow in industrial and eventually consumer environments as well. Mobile agents are one way to realize such applications, especially when used in a wireless environment. This article discusses issues and results related to the problem of making computer applications network-aware and reactive to changing network conditions. It contains a short overview of our work on mobile agents as well as a tutorial on network sensing from the agent perspective. Some prototypes of network sensing systems and network aware mobile-agent applications are presented.",

It examines issues related to the Internet (e.g., resources, QoS, and security), which must be addressed properly before the Internet can be considered as the paradigm for the GII. In addition, this article discusses the software aspect of network evolution, equally applicable to all network paradigms. It focuses on the emergence of full network operating systems, which should transform networks into integrated programmable platforms supporting the development and execution of a wide range of services. Finally, this article suggests cooperation in standards definition among all players to effectively answer the technological challenges of future networks and provide both fair competition and regulated liberalization. The standardization of emerging network capabilities encompassing broadband, wireless/mobility, the Internet, and ultimately the GII, is presently ongoing in the ITU-T Study Group (SG) 13, the lead study group on the GII, and other standards organizations.",

      "abstract": "Data communications standards to allow exchange of information between two application processes in different heterogeneous computing environments have been developed by International Standards groups. With the development of these standards, the need for managing the communications protocols was realized as part of both the Internet and OSI standards suites. This article addresses the network management paradigm developed as part of OSI standards. The OSI network management application includes three different aspects: categories of network management, a protocol that specifies the structure for transferring network management information, and information models that define resource-specific management information for the specific management functions. These three aspects will be described in this article. Network management functions are grouped into five categories: configuration, fault, performance, security, and accounting. The resource is managed to accomplish these functions. These five categories have been used not only in OSI network management but also in specifying the management functions for telecommunications network. These five categories are briefly discussed in the paper. The protocol structure for OSI network management is defined as an application service element known as CMISE. Regardless of the resource being managed, the protocol defines a basic set of operations applicable to network management. The article discusses the semantics of the various operations and the parameters associated with each operation. Using the structure defined by the protocol, for the various management functions, information is modeled to represent the managed resource. Object-oriented principles are used in defining information models. An introduction to these principles is provided. The management information exchanged is a combination of the three aspects. As part of OSI network management, information models to represent communication entities have been developed. An example is shown to illustrate the exchanged message for a management function. The article reiterates the three aspects and points out the advantages offered by this network management paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Simulation has always been an indispensable tool in the design and analysis of telecommunication networks. Due to performance limitations of the majority of simulators, usually network simulations have been done for rather small network models and for short timescales. In contrast, many difficult design problems facing today's network engineers concern the behavior of very large hierarchical multihop networks carrying millions of multiprotocol flows over long timescales. Examples include scalability and stability of routing protocols, packet losses in core routers, of long-lasting transient behavior due to observed self-similarity of traffic patterns. Simulation of such systems would greatly benefit from application of parallel computing technologies, especially now that multiprocessor workstations and servers have become commonly available. However, parallel simulation has not yet been widely embraced by the telecommunications community due to a number of difficulties. Based on our accumulated experience in parallel network simulation projects, we believe that parallel simulation technology has matured to the point that it is ready to be used in industrial practice of network simulation. This article highlights work in parallel simulations of networks and their promise.",

This article studies the dynamics and performance of the TCP/IP protocol over the ABR and UBR services of ATM networks. Specifically the buffering requirements in the ATM switches as well as the ATM edge devices. It is shown that with a good switch algorithm, ABR pushes congestion to the edges of the ATM network while UBR leaves it inside the ATM portion. As a result, the switch ABR buffer requirement for zero-packet-loss high-throughput TCP transmission is a sublinear function of the number of TCP connections.",

This article draws analogies with well-known performance criteria for wireless communications systems toward setting a comprehensive suite of benchmarks for wireless location systems.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a performance analysis of the IrDA protocol used for short-range IR data communication using an analytical mathematical model. The IrDA protocol specifies a protocol stack for reliable short-range infrared wireless data communication between devices with the data link layer (IrLAP) being an HDLC derivative. The mathematical model is based on unidirectional data transfer and uses the concept of the virtual transmission time, which provides the average end-to-end transmission time of a packet, incorporating the time for retransmissions if packet errors occur or other enforced delays. Analytical results are produced for throughput against packet size, BER and minimum turnaround time. They indicate certain limitations of the protocol for efficient throughput at high data speeds, and indicate that the maximum frame size and window size should be increased and the minimum turnaround time minimized for improved results.",

It is shown that the sensitivity of a PPM scheme is more affected by multipath dispersion than a similar OOK format. Under the constraint of ambient noise, the findings were opposite. Both systems operate at 10 Mb/s and a wavelength of 850 nm. In a line-of-sight configuration, PPM offers an 8.77 dB sensitivity improvement over a comparable OOK system. In a semi-diffuse system impaired by multipath dispersion, the sensitivity improvement is reduced to 7.13 dB. When corrupted by ambient noise, the improvement was found to be 8.8 dB, which is slightly more.",

      "abstract": "Due to the FCC requirement that operators of mobile communications networks be able to accurately locate mobile callers requesting emergency assistance via 911 by the year 2001, there has been a lot of activity among cellular and PCS providers to examine cellular positioning options. This article examines positioning solutions for the GSM group of standards. Worldwide deployment of GSM systems is well underway, and the positioning characteristics of the various systems are similar. The authors examine the ability to derive position information from GSM signals, based on their May 1996 achievement of accurate position measurements using GSM. Features of GSM signals relevant to positioning are analyzed as well as results achieved and the authors' ongoing positioning trials. Finally, other issues related to GSM positioning and mobile phone positioning in general are covered.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a novel methodology for protocol design, using incremental construction of the protocol from elements called protocol boosters on an as-needed basis. Protocol boosters are an adaptation technique that allows dynamic and efficient protocol customization to heterogeneous environments. By design, the boosting mechanism is under control of a policy, which determines when augmentation is required. Thus, many portions of a protocol stack execute only as necessary, permitting significant increases in performance relative to general-purpose protocols. Design principles for protocol boosters are presented, as well as an example booster. Two implementation platforms are described: (1) an augmented Linux operating system, which is freely available to other researchers; and (2) a rapidly reprogrammable hardware prototype, called the Programmable Protocol Processing Pipeline (P4), which is based on off-the-shelf FPGA technology. Since protocol boosters are programmed functions and can be network-resident, a programmable network infrastructure is necessary to exploit their full capability. Thus, protocol boosters are an ideal application for an on-the-fly programmable network infrastructure.",

They have not, however, been a very dynamic part of telecom networks, planned, as they were, for the long term and usually with limited technological innovation. This is changing, and access networks are increasingly coming into focus for technological innovation and as platforms for provisioning new advanced services in a competitive business environment. New fiber, radio, and copper-based technologies, in combination with flexible multiplexers and management tools, provide new possibilities for improved quality of services, cost reduction, and provisioning of new advanced services. In order to fully benefit from these possibilities, to extend and upgrade existing as well as build completely new access networks, a flexible service-independent access network architecture and access network system are required. In this article a target access network architecture is suggested as well as an implementation scenario for developing countries.",

This simulator shares many high-level features of the ATM Forum's P-NNI routing protocol; topology-state advertisement, on-demand source routing, call admission control and generic call admission control, hierarchical routing, and crank-back and rerouting. Simulations can be carried out at both the call and cell levels. Although this simulation tool has been designed primarily to simulate routing protocols, it can easily be extended to simulate other elements of an AIM traffic control architecture.",

      "abstract": "Currently worldwide activities are going on to define third-generation mobile radio systems (IMT-2000 on ITU/UMTS in Europe). These systems aim to support a wide range of services from voice and low-rate data up to high-rate data services, including multimedia services, and circuit- and packet-oriented services. These systems will operate in all radio environments to provide service to anyone, anytime, anywhere. In Europe the European Commission is partly funding research activities in the ACTS framework related to third-generation systems. A spectrum-efficient multiple access scheme proposal is being developed by the ACTS FRAMES project to fulfill the requirements for terrestrial third-generation mobile radio systems. The results and proposals of FRAMES are used as input mainly to the ETSI standardization process. This radio access scheme addresses the different worldwide standardization activities where TDMA and CDMA-based solutions are currently expected. Different proposals for the UMTS system architecture and network issues are currently being discussed in the relevant standardization bodies. On one hand, the GRAN approach envisages a single UMTS access part able to connect with multiple core networks; on the other hand, the generic core network approach proposes to develop UMTS core network functionality able to handle multiple access networks, which can adopt different types of radio access techniques. The ACTS RAINBOW project presents a proposal where both approaches are unified in a system structure. From the network planning viewpoint, the major features of a third-generation mobile system are the wide variety of services provided, the high number of customers expected (especially in urban and densely populated areas), the network architecture flexibility to allow different configurations to be deployed, and the advanced mobility management strategies. From this perspective the ACTS STORMS project is elaborating new planning methodologies tailored to the specific needs of a UMTS operator, and designing and developing a set of software modules covering the whole set of disciplines involved in mobile network planning.",

Our study indicates that both first- and second-order traffic statistics, measured within a given frequency-window, have a very significant impact on the queue length and loss rate performance. In the design of the second component, matched modeling, the focal point is to construct a stochastic model that can match a wide range of important statistics collected in various applications. New methodologies and fast algorithms are developed for such construction on the basis of a circulant modulated Poisson process (CMPP). For the third component, queuing solutions, the basic requirement is to provide numerical solutions of the queue length and loss rate for transport of given traffic in a finite buffer system. A fast and stable computation method, called a Folding algorithm, is applied to provide both steady-state and transient solutions of various kinds, including congestion control performance where arriving traffic are selectively discarded based on queue thresholds. We provide both design methodologies and software architectures of these three components, with discussion of practical engineering issues for the use of the SMAQ tool.",

For instance, it can be used as a traffic generator to generate various traces for network testing. It also provides numerical solutions of the queue length and loss rate performance for transport of multimedia traffic. Several application modules are built into the tool for the evaluation of statistical multiplexing, buffer dimensioning, and link bandwidth allocation. Other examples include the evaluation of traffic shaping, local-congestion control, and the modeling of wireless channel dynamics. As one will find, the SMAQ tool indeed provides a solution technique for network engineers to solve many of the current design issues.",

      "abstract": "Safety and security are two reliability properties of a system. A \"safe\" system provides protection against errors of trusted users, while a \"secure\" system protects against errors introduced by untrusted users. There is considerable overlap between mechanisms to support each property. Requirements for rapid service creation have stimulated the development of programmable network infrastructures, where end users or service providers can customize the properties of a network infrastructure while it continues to operate. A central concern of potential users of such systems is their reliability and, most specifically, their safety and security. In this article we explain the impact the network service model and architecture have on safety and security, and provide a model with which policies can be translated into restrictions of a general system. We illustrate these ideas with the Secure Active Network Environment (SANE) architecture, which provides a means of controlling access to the functions provided by any programmable infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the secure provision of UMTS services in diverse access networks and is based upon the research work of the ACTS projects EXODUS, COBUCO, and ASPeCT. One of the distinguishing requirements of UMTS is that it should provide service in a number of distinct environments. This will necessitate the development of distinct radio interfaces for each environment, and a service provision and management functionality that can operate across diverse access technologies. Projects within the ACTS program are addressing these issues, and we highlight the UMTS platforms developed by the COBUCO and EXODUS projects. The EXODUS services, access network, IN-based functional architecture, and mobility management are described, which address the deployment of UMTS services through wired (ATM) and wireless (DECT) access networks. This is followed by a description of the services, access network, and mobility management in the COBUCO project, where the emphasis is on the deployment of UMTS services in private networks using DECT access. Both projects are studying the practicability of selected UMTS services as demonstrated in an operating trial system. Having described these platforms, we focus on the security issues raised by UMTS. These are being studied by the ASPeCT project, and we discuss how the security features developed are being integrated into the UMTS platforms. The focus here is on the joint trials scheduled with the EXODUS project.",

Service-level QoS issues are identified, and they have been studied as a part of service quality issues in TINA service architecture. TINA stream binding and its role in the TINA QoS framework are presented. Soft guarantee of stream quality is proposed, which does not require strict resource reservation. The soft guarantee concept combined with TINA stream binding architecture supports progressive evolution of service quality.",

      "abstract": "Singapore is the first country in the world to have a nationwide broadband network infrastructure deployed. What started as an experimental ATM testbed network in 1995 has now become a nationwide broadband infrastructure called Singapore ONE, launched in 1997 to provide residential broadband access via ADSL or CATV cable modem technologies, and business access via ATM. As of June 1998, Singapore ONE supported more than 10,000 users with over 120 commercial applications. More than 100,000 users are projected by the end of 1999, increasing to 400,000 by the year 2001. In order to support the technological needs of broadband communications under Singapore ONE, and to address the national R&amp;D agenda in this area, an advanced research network called the Singapore Advanced Research and Education Network (SingAREN) was established in late 1997. This article gives an overview of the broadband infrastructure initiatives in Singapore, focusing on the SingAREN project. The goals of SingAREN, its network configuration, the research programs and activities to date, and plans for the future are described.",

It provides enhanced telecommunications services controlled by a computer, that is by integrating the call handling capabilities of PBXs and the data processing capabilities of computers. CTI applications have become more popular and widespread with the rapid and deep penetration of personal computers and the dramatic growth of the Internet since the mid-1990s. CTI applications are being enhanced by means of more integration with Internet capabilities. Several standardization organizations and fora/consortia are developing standards/specifications for CTI in order to cope with the growing demand for multimedia communications. This article describes a brief historical sketch and the state of the art of CTI-related standards and specifications, which are still being developed.",

      "abstract": "The transmission of digital video over wireless networks is becoming a reality: it is now possible to construct working prototype systems which illustrate the benefits to be accrued from the integration of mobile computing and digital video. However, systems which deploy video in mobile environments must be able to adapt to changes in the quality of service of their underlying communications channel. The authors focus on the practical applications and implications of supporting adaptive video in mobile environments. In particular, we describe a testbed which supports multicast transmission of stored and live video sequences over both WaveLAN and GSM technologies. The testbed employs H.263 and MPEG encoding techniques and enables clients to freely roam between heterogeneous networks while maintaining video connectivity.",

      "abstract": "Several problems have to be overcome before personalized interactive video communication services over radio frequency networks can become a reality. The challenge of being able to support wireless video services is significant since video is generally recognized as being bandwidth-hungry, error-sensitive, and sometimes delay-intolerant; radio channels, on the other hand, are characterized as having limited capacity and high bit error rates, and being time-varying. Under such hostile conditions the author explores issues in supporting real-time digital video communications over infrastructure-based wireless networks. The guiding philosophy behind the work described is that robust wireless video communications is possible if the different components within the network, operating system, and application layers cooperate with one another and with the overall system.",

      "abstract": "We present a mixed-integer programming model for the problem of designing a survivable capacitated network, and describe a cutting plane algorithm for its solution. The model and the solution methods are integrated in our network dimensioning tool, DISCNET. Given a communication demand between each pair of switching nodes in a region, the task is to determine the topology of a telecommunication network connecting the given nodes and to select, from a given set of valid values, a capacity for each potential physical link such that the communication demands are satisfied, even if a network component fails. A solution consists of the chosen links and their capacity, as well as the routings for each demand, in the case of failure-free operation and the case of single component (node or link) failure. We suggest two alternative models to deal with failures of single network components. The first employs diversified paths to guarantee the routing of a specified fraction of each demand without rerouting effort; the second allows rerouting in failure situations. At the end we discuss alternative ways to implement survivability using these two models.",

The government-owned Jabatan Talikom, which hitherto operated the network, was incorporated in 1987 and subsequently privatized a few years later, with a majority share holding by the government. The regulatory aspects were spun off under the slim looking JTM. This marked the beginning of liberalization, and many new players entered the fray. This article reviews the telecommunications infrastructure and services available in Malaysia and visits some of the telcos offering these services. Some pertinent issues affecting the industry are also discussed.",

Among these are the introduction of competition in the telecommunications market, the allowance of foreign ownership of telecommunication services, and the deployment of new networks and services, all within a new legal framework. As demands for more diversified and high-quality telecommunications increase, Korea is now preparing for a major communication infrastructure that can serve as a common network foundation. Named the Korea Information Infrastructure, it is planned to provide a new network foundation that will serve as the core of the information society in the 21st century. This article describes the current status of and future perspectives on the Korean telecommunications markets, industry, and infrastructure.",

The objective is to enable the development of open signaling, control, and management applications as well as higher-level multimedia services on networks. The scope of this effort includes ATM switches, circuit switches, IP routers, and hybrid switches such as those that provide for fast switching of IP packets over an ATM backbone. The basic ideas represented herein are in the process of development as a standard for application programming interfaces for networks under IEEE Standards Project IEEE P1520.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes network solutions to the congestion on the PSTN caused by residential Internet and online subscribers in North America. The conflicts caused by Internet traffic on the PSTN are network problems and the impacts of this traffic-from origination to termination-must be understood and addressed. To develop an understanding of Internet traffic, the data from traffic studies performed by two LECs was gathered and analyzed, and the observed traffic was characterized. This traffic characterization, combined with a knowledge of the North American LEC network, has allowed the existing and future impacts of the increasing number of residential Internet subscribers to be estimated. The network solutions presented and discussed were developed to address these impacts. The Internet traffic observed from usage studies can be characterized by very long holding times and, in some cases, very high numbers of call overflows (calls routed to busy tone), especially late in the evenings. These unusual patterns cause the overall switch traffic to increase, but at the switch sub-component level their effects can be more serious. Telephone operators faced with high penetrations of Internet subscribers can expect to support the cost of additional trunking equipment, additional line equipment, and continuous equipment regrading and load balancing, as well as the risk of denying or degrading service to end users. Traditional solutions, although well understood, are reactive in nature; but for low penetrations of Internet users, they provide low-risk solutions. This article proposes nontraditional network solutions which introduce new functionality into the network. Not only do these solutions relieve all network congestion, they also allow the LEC to offer new services while evolving the network to meet future demands. The initial effort to establish a new network architecture and a new service can be considerable, but for LECs facing large penetrations of Internet subscribers, such innovative network solutions are the key to network profitability.",

The article gives an overview of the structure and achievements of TINA-C so far and outlines future work items. The main concepts summarized in this article include business modeling, sessions, computing framework, distributed processing environment, service architecture, and network resource information modeling. Interworking concepts and migration strategy from existing technologies toward TINA and a short description of validation activities are delineated. The scope of the TINA-C initiative-including the provisioning of multimedia services, allowing flexibility in combining any kind of connectivity, third-party connection setup, and broadcasting, as well as multiparty involvement-can be seen as a most valuable complement to the global information infrastructure activities, providing an architectural underpinning for the global information infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Most research in network programmability has stressed the flexibility engendered by increasing the ability of users to configure network elements for their own purposes, without addressing the larger issues of how such advanced control systems can coexist both with each other and with more conventional ones. The Tempest framework presented here extends beyond the provision of simple network programmability to address these larger issues. In particular, we show how network programmability can be achieved without jeopardizing the integrity of the network as a whole, how network programmability fits in with existing networks, and how programmability can be offered at different levels of granularity. Our approach is based on the Tempest's ability to dynamically create virtual private networks over a switched transport architecture (e.g., an ATM network). Each VPN is assigned a set of network resources which can be controlled using either a well-known control system or a control system tailored to the specific needs of a distributed application. The first level of programmability in the Tempest is fairly coarse-grained: an entire virtual network can be programmed by a third party. At a finer level of granularity the Tempest allows user supplied code to be injected into parts of an operational virtual network, thus allowing application specific customization of network control. The article shows how the Tempest framework allows these new approaches to coexist with more conventional solutions.",

This article gives an overview of infrared technology and describes the IEEE 802.11 specification in detail, presenting a historical perspective of its development. The infrared physical layer was designed for diffuse systems supporting two data rates (1 and 2 Mb/s) and includes provisions for a smooth migration to higher data rates. The specification is suitable for low-cost transceivers but allows interoperability with higher-performance systems. The main application envisaged for IEEE 802.11 infrared wireless local area networks is ad hoc networks.",

In particular, terminal-pair availabilities are computed for a service-bearing transport signal that traverses a unidirectional path-switched ring (UPSR) system, a bidirectional line-switched ring (BLSR) system, a series of interconnected ring (UPSR and/or BLSR) systems, called a ring chain, within a general ring-based mesh network, and a series of interconnected point-to-point systems within a general point-to-point mesh network. In addition, these network structures are evaluated with varying degrees of fiber link and system interconnection node survivabilities; specifically, two-fiber and four-fiber link configurations are evaluated, and an intersystem nodal survivability factor a is used to characterize a transport signal of a given service level. Based on the results of these computations, several key observations are highlighted that should be considered when planning and designing short- and long-haul self-healing networks.",

A number of spectrum managers have investigated the use of economic tools to overcome these problems, including an analysis of the economic value of the spectrum, pricing the spectrum, allowing trading in spectrum, and using competitions to assign spectrum. This article examines the roles of these techniques and suggests that there is a strong argument for their widespread adoption within most spectrum managers.",

However, while IP and ATM routing and forwarding functions must be more closely integrated, a differentiation according to type of traffic seems advantageous; hence the need to evolve to an IP over ATM dual-mode routing model.",

      "abstract": "The services to be supported by an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)-based multiservice network differ significantly in terms of their traffic characteristics and required quality of service. During the last few years it has been broadly accepted that efficient use of transmission capacity is not possible unless these differences are reflected in the way the related traffic streams are handled within the ATM layer. To address this need, the ATM Forum and ITU-T have specified different real-time and non-real-time ATM-layer service categories. This article first discusses the requirements for traffic management in a switch supporting all these service categories from the service providers' and users' points of view. The first generation of ATM switches, typically equipped with small cell buffers, only satisfies the requirements for the real-time service categories (CBR, rt-VBR). Statistical multiplexing, if supported at all, is limited to connections with low peak cell rates. Larger cell buffers and new traffic control functions are required to support non-real-time service categories (nrt-VBR, ABR, UBR). A switch architecture which is scalable from small to large system sizes is presented. It provides the required buffering and additional functions for the non-real-time service categories with the aid of a statistical multiplexing unit (SMU), a module which can also be used as an optional addition to a conventional ATM switch. The focus is on the functional description of two novel yet key components of the SMU, namely the buffer management and cell scheduling functions. The buffer management function provides per-VC queuing and achieves an optimal utilization of the large cell buffer shared by connections of different service categories. The two-stage cell scheduling function supports traffic shaping on the VC and VP levels, and weighted fair queuing within groups of connections. The overall concept supports high link utilization, fairness, and throughput guarantees, and enables a migration from today's ATM networks to a fully integrated multiservice network. Finally, implementation aspects are discussed to show the feasibility of the concept for very high bit rates.",

      "abstract": "WDM is currently taking over as the leading technology in point-to-point transmission links. For optical implementation of WDM networks, logical functionalities such as wavelength (channel) selection should be carried out in the wavelength domain; thus, the development of dynamic optical devices is required. One key device is a tunable optical filter. Important features of such a filter include low insertion loss, narrow bandwidth, high sidelobe suppression, large dynamic range, fast tuning speed, a simple control mechanism, small size, and cost effectiveness. Here, an extensive overview of the different technologies used to produce tunable optical filters is presented. Among them, fiber filters such as fiber Bragg gratings and fiber Fabry Perot are the most commercialized, yet inherently limited in their dynamic speeds. For high demanding dynamics, micro-machined and acousto-optic filters can offer a good solution for microsecond tuning speeds. Faster tunable devices, in nanosecond tuning speeds, might emerge out of microresonators, electrooptic filters, and active DBR filters.",

      "abstract": "The UMTS terrestrial radio access is based on wideband 4.096 Mchip/s DS-CDMA technology. UTRA will be connected to an evolved GSM core network for both circuit and packet services. A merger between ETSI/Europe and ARIB/Japan based on W-CDMA, a GSM core network, and a common frequency allocation according to the ITU Recommendation of 2 GHz makes a global IMT-2000 standard feasible. UTRA based on W-CDMA fully supports the UMTS/IMT-2000 requirements (e.g., support of 384 kb/s for wide-area coverage and 2 Mb/s for local coverage). Furthermore, the air interface has flexible support of mixed services, variable-rate services, and an efficient packet mode. Key W-CDMA features also include improved basic capacity/coverage performance compared to second-generation systems, full support of adaptive antenna arrays, support of hierarchical cell structures with interfrequency handover, and support of asynchronous inter-base-station operation. There have been no constraints due to the strong requirements for backward compatibility with second-generation systems. This has facilitated a high degree of flexibility and a future-proof air interface. Extensive evaluations by means of simulations and field trials have been carried out by a number of companies, and full system tests are ongoing. Consequently, W-CDMA technology can now be regarded as a mature technology, ready to provide the basis for UMTS/IMT-2000.",

      "abstract": "The principal object of this article is to highlight the changes to lifestyle, culture, society, and architecture emerging or likely to emerge as a direct result of developments in communications technology. Its secondary objective is to provoke discussion and a little healthy dissent in the academic community. The methodology employed is of the reflective phenomenological paradigm; reading and broad personal observations have formed the basis for trend identification and critical reflection which provide the main thrust of the article. The definition of literacy must be revised to embrace the new technologies, and the definition of creativity must emphasize synthesis at the expense of genesis. Of particular concern is the erosion of cultures and languages. The author argues that far from promoting democracy and enfranchising the general populace, technology effectively undermines the basis of democracy by the creation of an information underclass. This class will have the right and means to take part in the democratic process but will lack the information necessary for the decision-making process. Far from introducing an electronic agora, technology is moving societies toward a form of Jeffersonian democracy in which property rights will take precedence over human rights. McLuhan's (1970) global village vision is critically examined against the emerging reality, and the author concludes that the global village is unachievable in the medium term, partly for technical reasons and partly for social reasons. The communications revolution is not a liberating experience for most people; instead, life has come to be measured in seconds. With a corresponding loss of longer-term focus and sense of place. The author concludes that steps must be taken to preserve the quality of the media and the standard of its content; these are unlikely to arise from the \"connected masses\" and can only come from organizations and governments. The right to freedom of speech does not imply the right to be heard. Some controls must be enforced on the Internet to ensure the survival of art, culture, and national identity. Perhaps most contentious is the view that those most closely involved with the development of the technology should take some responsibility for their creation. Convergence in media is resulting in collisions in society at large. Finally, McLuhan's statement \"The medium is the message\" is examined and found wanting: the medium is not the message any more than the marketing is the product.",

      "abstract": "Wideband wireless access based on direct sequence code division multiple access aimed at third-generation mobile communications systems is reviewed. W-CDMA is designed to flexibly offer wideband services which cannot be provided by present cellular systems, with various data rates as high as 2 Mb/s. The important concept of W-CDMA is the introduction of intercell asynchronous operation and the pilot channel associated with individual data channels. Intercell asynchronous operation facilitates continuous system deployment from outdoors to indoors. Other technical features of W-CDMA include fast cell search under intercell asynchronous operation, fast transmit power control, coherent spreading code tracking, a coherent RAKE receiver, orthogonal multispreading factor forward link, and variable-rate transmission with blind rate detection. The introduction of the data-channel-associated pilot channel allows W-CDMA to support interference cancellation and adaptive antenna array techniques that can significantly increase the link capacity and coverage. This article presents the radio link performance evaluated by computer simulation. Field experiment radio link performance results are also presented.",

      "abstract": "A framework for statistical modeling of the wideband characteristics of the frequency-selective fading multipath indoor radio channel for geolocation applications is presented. Multipath characteristics of the channel are divided into three classes according to availability and the strength of the direct line of sight (DLOS) path with respect to the other paths. Statistics of the error in estimating the time of arrival of the DLOS path in a building is related to the receiver's sensitivity and dynamic range. The effects of external walls on estimating the location of the DLOS path are analyzed.",

      "abstract": "We consider wireless ATM concepts for small LANs, especially for SOHO and future consumer applications. We describe a wireless ATM LAN framework architecture that supports wireless ATM communications in environments with and without fixed ATM infrastructure. For the configuration with an ATM infrastructure, a distributed ATM switched backbone is proposed, which enables a smart ATM switching element to be embedded in every wireless and fixed access point. For bandwidth efficiency and ease of operation (place-and-play), we also propose an ad hoc wireless ATM LAN concept based on the same 5 GHz wireless ATM air interface as is currently under standardization in the ETSI/BRAN and ATM Forum. Unlike CSMA-based ad hoc systems such as HIPERLAN and IEEE802.11, our ad hoc wireless ATM system makes QoS management feasible in an infrastructureless environment by using resource reservation and scheduled medium access protocol. Since cost scalability is essential throughout our system design, we consider forwarding between ad hoc subnets and interworking with the fixed network as important but optional features.",
