      "abstract": "Uncompressed high-definition video streaming over wireless personal area networks is a challenging problem because of the high data rate requirement and channel variations. With the advances in RF technology and the huge bandwidth available worldwide in the 57-66 GHz millimeter-wave unlicensed spectrum, mmWave WPANs that can support multigigabit transmission are being developed. However, compared to low-frequency signals (2.4 or 5 GHz), mmWave signals are more fragile; indeed, the propagation losses are significantly higher. In this article we present an mmWave system for supporting uncompressed HD video up to 3 Gb/s. The system includes various efficient error protection and concealment schemes that exploit unequal error resilience properties of uncompressed video. Some of them have been adopted in the emerging 60 GHz WPAN standards such as WirelessHD, ECMA TC48, and IEEE 802.15.3c. Simulations using real uncompressed HD images indicate that the proposed mmWave system can maintain, under poor channel conditions, good average peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and low video quality metric scores.",

      "abstract": "We have studied the effects of the mobile vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel on scaled versions of the current IEEE 802.11 a standard to investigate how readily they can be applied to vehicular networks. In particular, measured parameters for the V2V channel at 5.9 GHz in suburban, highway, and rural environments are studied in the context of critical parameters for OFDM. Actual performance of scaled OFDM waveforms with bandwidths of 20 MHz (bandwidth of IEEE 802.11 a), 10 MHz (bandwidth of the draft IEEE 802.11 p), and 5 MHz (halved bandwidth of IEEE 802.11 p) are described and interpreted in light of the channel parameters. At 20 MHz the guard interval is not long enough, while at 5 MHz errors increase from lack of channel stationarity over the packet duration. For these choices of the scaled 802.11 a OFDM waveform, 10 MHz appears to be the best choice.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a new paradigm to integrate the Chinese digital television/terrestrial multimedia broadcasting (DTMB) systems with existing mobile communication systems, which can support mobile multimedia broadcasting services with carrier-grade quality. By dividing the services into four categories -digital TV, video on demand, data on demand, and Internet access - a complete design of the layered structure and signaling protocols are presented. Specifically, a subnetwork data unit layer and a modified hybrid ARQ signaling protocol have been proposed. A testbed at Tsinghua University based on DTMB and WLAN/CDMAlx has been successfully implemented, and the experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed signaling protocols.",

Indeed, we enter the summer of 2008 projecting that cable multiple- system operators - faced with ever-tightening bandwidth constraints as they seek to add more HDTV programming, niche programming, and other digital offerings - will cover more than half of the United States and Canada with switched digital installations by the end of the year and 75 percent or more of their cable footprint by the close of 2009.

      "abstract": "Multihop cellular networks (MCNs) combine traditional single-hop cellular networks with ad hoc networks. They have emerged recently as an active research topic due to their throughput advantages and low cost. Most of the research on MCNs has been focused on lower-layer issues such as routing. Application layer issues in MCNs are seldom addressed. In this article we tackle one of these issues: signaling for conferencing. Conferencing enables a range of \"killer\" applications such as videoconferencing, gaming, and distance learning. Signaling is a critical component that handles session initiation, modification, and termination. We have proposed a general signaling architecture for integrated 3G/ MANETs that is applicable to the specific case of MCNs. This architecture is based on application- layer clusters and faces several performance drawbacks. This article focuses on optimizing the architecture performance for the specific environment of an MCN. We first present this MCN environment and discuss conferencing scenarios. We propose an optimization architecture based on cross-layer design, which is then compared to the existing proposals, followed by a set of optimization schemes. The article also discusses initial evaluation results.",

      "abstract": "Using circuit-switched optical networks for next generation e-science applications is gaining increasing interest. In such applications, circuits are provisioned for end hosts to accomplish data-intensive or QoS-stringent communication tasks. Existing provisioning methods provide point-to-point connectivity for end hosts, that is, an established circuit connects one end host to another, and during the lifetime of the circuit, only communication tasks between the connected end hosts can be served. This inhibits circuits from being used in more general cases, where each end host communicates with different remote parities simultaneously through a single network interface. We propose V-STONES - a data flow-based VLAN tagging and switching technique to increase the connectivity of end host network interfaces in circuit-switched networks. With V-STONES, not only can an IP end host communicate with different remote systems concurrently through bandwidth guaranteed connections, but also protocol entities at different stack layers can talk to their counterparts through dedicated bandwidth pipes. In this article, we review the existing circuit provisioning methods and then discuss V-STONES and the architecture of cross-layer circuit provisioning for end hosts. We also introduce a prototype implementation in an optical network testbed and present the experimental results.",

      "abstract": "Exactly 150 years ago, August 1858, the world witnessed a historic event in the history of telecommunications: the successful transmission of telegraph messages across the Atlantic Ocean. Although the transatlantic cable carrying these messages failed after a few weeks of operation, and it wasn't until 1866 that permanent transatlantic telegraph cable transmission became possible, the 1858 transmissions were heralded worldwide as a major achievement, introducing a new Age of Information. To commemorate this literally earth-shaking accomplishment 150 years ago, the History Column this month presents an article entitled \"A History of Transatlantic Cables\" by Jerry Hayes of Concordia University, Canada, a member of the ComSoc History Committee. Interestingly, it took almost another 100 years until the first transatlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, was successfully launched. Jerry covers this epoch-making event in his article as well, in addition to the various undersea telephone cables that followed in the years after. So we are actually commemorating two historic events in this column: the first successful transmission of telegraph data across the ocean, and the first successful transatlantic cable transmission of voice. We commend the article following to you.Special Notice: The ComSoc History Committee is sponsoring a special History Session at the forthcoming IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 in New Orleans. This session, the first of its kind, and coorganized by History Committee members Jacob Baal-Schem of Israel and Mischa Schwartz, will take place Tuesday, December 2, from 1:30-6 p.m. It will consist of three parts: a keynote address on the history of OFDM by Steve Weinstein, a past President of ComSoc and a pioneer in the field of OFDM; four reviewed papers covering a variety of topics on the history of communications; and a panel discussion on the topic \"Who Invented Radio?\" The panelists, a distinguished group of authorities and historians in the field, drawn from the Uni",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio networks will provide high bandwidth to mobile users via heterogeneous wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. However, CR networks impose challenges due to the fluctuating nature of the available spectrum, as well as the diverse QoS requirements of various applications. Spectrum management functions can address these challenges for the realization of this new network paradigm. To provide a better understanding of CR networks, this article presents recent developments and open research issues in spectrum management in CR networks. More specifically, the discussion is focused on the development of CR networks that require no modification of existing networks. First, a brief overview of cognitive radio and the CR network architecture is provided. Then four main challenges of spectrum management are discussed: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.",

One of the goals of accountability is the capability to trace an event (e.g., the leaking of secure information or an outside attack), even after the event occurred so that the causes can be determined. This article first provides a survey of accountability with a general overview of the topic, using electronic patient records and various computer and network attacks as a model. Then, it describes and analyzes practical framework applications of accountability systems. An insurable network architecture, called A-NET is proposed. Then, an algorithm to achieve true accountable administration is proposed, namely, that an administrator's activities must be accountable. Finally, accountability for wireless LANs, ad hoc networks, and wireless mesh networks are studied.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of IPTV increases competition for telecom operators. Especially video on demand and the move to HDTV push the bandwidth requirements to the limits. It is very challenging for an operator to construct a successful and sustainable introduction of IPTV over the existing infrastructure. This article gives an overview of a typical business case followed by a detailed discussion of the adoption and evaluation of the outcome. The results of this article indicate the importance of a correct choice of adoption model and related parameters. It illustrates how different IPTV-specific effects on adoption (i.e., competition and analog switchoff) might have a considerable impact on the outcome. After adoption, the article shows how the outcome of the business case can be used within pricing decisions by setting sustainable and competitive boundaries on the tariff. Finally, as pricing will also have an important impact on adoption (e.g., a price reduction could lead to increased adoption), the possible impact of this feedback loop is indicated. In this sense the approach discussed in the article could easily be extended with a highly detailed cost model of the network architecture and technology, leading to a full business case for IPTV introduction by a telecom operator.",

      "abstract": "As data rates outpace the capabilities of electronic encryption schemes, photonic layer security may fill the gap in providing a communication security solution at high data rates. In this article we review and highlight the advantages of our proposed optical code-division multiplexed (OCDM)-based photonic layer security (PLS) system based on high-resolution control of the optical phase of tightly spaced phase locked laser lines. Such a PLS system is scaleable to 100 Gb/s and provides a protocol independent security solution. We review the use of high-resolution control of the optical phase of mode-locked laser frequency combs as an enabling technology for a new class of OCDM systems. A network based on such systems is compatible with and can have comparable spectral efficiency to existing DWDM networks. Through inverse multiplexing of 10 Gb/s tributaries, we have already demonstrated optical transmission of a 40 Gb/s aggregate OCDM signal over 400 km. Such a PLS solution is achieved through shared phase scrambling of the individual OCDM codes assigned to each of the tributaries using an integrated micro-ring resonator-based phase coder/scrambler. The confidentiality of OCDM-based PLS is robust against exhaustive, known plain text, and archival/forensic attacks, and can complement digital encryption operating at higher layers. Moreover, the integrity of the PLS solution is ensured through the inherent coupling to confidentiality, since knowledge of the key is needed in order to easily alter the transmitted data stream without introducing observable errors. This system can leverage advances in optical integration to support new applications where electronic encryption is impractical because of space, weight, power, availability, and cost requirements. Such applications range from timely security support for the emerging 100 GbE standards to all-optical multilevel security offered through the compatibility of PLS with transparent DWDM networks.",

      "abstract": "Ethernet is one of the potential candidates capable of meeting the bandwidth demands of subscribers and successfully supporting various services in broadband access networks. However, the lack of a traffic management capability is a major obstacle to successful deployment. In this article we suggest an Ethernet switch architecture that offers performance-guaranteed broadband access services. We also discuss the micro-architecture of the switch and associated design issues. Switches in the proposed architecture identify subscriber traffic without handling higher layer protocols, regulate it with per subscriber traffic policing, and ensure deterministic network performance. The implemented switch ASIC offers 28 gigabit Ethernet ports, integrating 9 million logic gates and 51 memories holding a total of 3.4 Mb to store data and control states on a single 10 mm x 10 mm die using 0.13 mum CMOS technology. The performance evaluation results, verified using a network performance analyzer, show that the proposed architecture guarantees transfer rates of individual subscribers based on their service agreements, effectively protecting network resources from excess traffic, which adversely affects the QoS of existing users' traffic.",

      "abstract": "The recent advent of networked home appliances has enabled enhanced on-demand multimedia services to be feasible. Especially, personal video recorders have made it more convenient to manage broadcast TV programs at home by storing them on their own disks. However, standalone PVRs have limitations on availability of TV programs due to limited reception channel and storage capacity. Networked PVR services can get over these limitations by storing all broadcast TV programs in remote storage systems that servers provide. Thus, these networked PVR services can have several advantages over standalone PVRs in terms of cost and availability. In this article we therefore propose an on-demand TV service architecture for networked PVRs to reduce response times to interactive operations and save network bandwidth. Finally, we show from simulation results that our proposed architecture both decreases the number of programs whose initial time-shifting operations are delayed and increases the hit ratio in cache servers significantly.",

In this article we present a scalable VOD distribution architecture for broadband operators. The solution is based on a P2P streaming concept in which a VOD streaming session requested by a given STB is actually provisioned via a multisource streaming session. This solution has the advantage of scaling naturally with the number of STBs in the network. In this article we focus on efficiently translating the popularity distribution into content availability in the network. Different aspects related to this issue are analyzed and challenges highlighted.",

In order to be able to evaluate the performance of the adversary, we define a set of security guarantees and requirements for an intrusion detection system and precisely define an adversary model. We then apply the proposed model for defining performance bounds of the worst case adversary and the quickest detection IDS in the IEEE 802.11 MAC.",

An overview of the technology alternatives available to enable high-bandwidth service transport is provided, along with a discussion of the relative merits of different approaches. The authors describe how wavelength division multiplexing, using large- scale photonic integrated circuits combined with the use of a digital virtual concatenation mapping protocol, can be used to enable decoupling of 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s service provisioning from the underlying optical link engineering, thereby enabling bandwidth virtualization. Real-world implementation examples of bandwidth virtualization are provided, including 40 Gb/s service transmission over a 2000-km fiber link with 65 ps of peak PMD, a field trial of 40 Gb/s service transmission over an 8477-km trans-oceanic network, and finally a field trial of a pre-standard 100 gigabit Ethernet service transmission over a 4000-km terrestrial long-haul network.",

The industry is now overcoming these hurdles with the transition to SFP + modules, which will enable more traditional Ethernet growth. Upcoming 40 GE and 100 GE are multilane protocols, presenting even greater challenges than 10 GE laced at its inception, potentially slowing their adoption. Leveraging SFP+ class technology such as simple EDC capabilities can lower cost and reduce module form factors, thus accelerating the transition to 40/100 GE interlace deployment.",

In particular, we highlight the importance of defining transparent and usable end-user interfaces and the impact of specific network equipment implementations on the deployment of NGN.",

The first technique will only work on a network infrastructure controlled by a single broadband operator due to limitations of IP multicast facilities. The main goal of the project is the study of a future system suitable for HQTV live streaming over the Internet based on P2P technology, or a P2P-HQTV system. The major focus is on overcoming today's pure layered approach through a cooperative paradigm in which the application and network layers cooperate to optimize the quality of service offered to end users.",

      "abstract": "Capital expenditures (capex) remain the most closely-watched metric for determining the direction and level of investment that telecommunications carriers are making in network equipment and services. In turn, carrier capital spending is driven by the combination of two primary factors: the number of customers served by that carrier, and the volume of services demanded by those customers. This article analyzes the size, scope, and outlook of capital expenditures among telecommunications carriers in the U.S., and assesses the significance of capital expenditures for the carriers' customers, equipment vendors, and investors. Written by John Celentano, a highly-regarded telecom marketing consultant, the paper's findings and conclusions are based on a study of more than 50 wireline and wireless carriers that will spend a combined US$65 billion in 2008.",

      "abstract": "This article sets out the opportunity and the role of Ethernet within large-scale carrier networks. Carrier Ethernet can greatly reduce the consequences of the complexity associated with the large scale and broad scope of carriers' networks by being a cost-effective replacement for SONET/SDH. However, in order to achieve this, carrier Ethernet needs to provide the equivalent level of transparency, simplicity, and reliability currently achieved by SONET/SDH, and the emerging IEEE Ethernet standards for PBB and PBB-TE are well suited to this role. These technologies are an ideal complement to IP/MPLS for which they can provide highly cost-effective managed and guaranteed bit pipes.",

      "abstract": "Maritime networks are one of the least studied network configurations. Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.",

In this article we describe and provide results for modeling vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless channels. V2V settings produce some unique conditions, and due to these conditions, V2V channels often exhibit greater dynamics than many conventional channels and, in addition, can also exhibit more severe fading. Thus, new channel models are needed to characterize this setting in order to evaluate contending transmission schemes and aid in V2V communication system design. A brief review of key statistical channel parameters is provided. Then both analytical and experimental V2V channel results are presented from the existing literature, and from our own measurement and modeling campaigns for the 5 GHz band. We also show the effects of these V2V channels on two types of transmission schemes.",

Some important tasks to be performed by the CR standardization community also are presented. These tasks will expedite the introduction of CR devices to the market while promoting a fair use of scarce radio resources. Some avenues for using the currently available standards for rapid deployment of CR devices, such as ISO standards, also are discussed.",

Proposed applications for VANETs have very diverse properties and often require nonstandard communication protocols. Moreover, the dynamics of the network due to vehicle movement further complicates the design of an appropriate comprehensive communication system. In this article we collect and categorize envisioned applications from various sources and classify the unique network characteristics of vehicular networks. Based on this analysis, we propose five distinct communication patterns that form the basis of almost all VANET applications. Both the analysis and the communication patterns shall deepen the understanding of VANETs and simplify further development of VANET communication systems.",

This is due not mainly to illegal downloads or file sharing, but much more to large-scale consumer communications and distributing contents among subscribers. The main advantage of P2P overlay networks over client-server-based systems is that they do not require central server components; and with respect to management and maintenance, P2P systems are self-managing, in that they can cope with nodes leaving and joining even at a high churn rate. Moreover, P2P systems are very scalable and can cope with a large number of nodes. Typically P2P systems operate as an overlay network on top of the IP layer.",

In order to ensure revenues, such content will require robust protection. This article reviews the concepts and approaches that have been learned and adopted by the wider TV industry over the last decade. The article covers work being done in the major international standards organizations; the elements that need to be addressed by a comprehensive content security system and the merits of the choices that can be made.",

Although multi-domain operation has been well-studied in packet/cell- switching networks, the multilayer (granularity) circuit-switched nature of modern optical networks presents a unique set of challenges. This survey addresses control plane design for such heterogeneous infrastructures and describes new challenges in the areas of state dissemination, path computation, and survivability. Sample results from a recent study also are presented.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces a novel framework of cooperative coded video multicast (CCVM) for provisioning IPTV services in metropolitan area access networks based on the emerging integration of Ethernet passive optical networks and WiMAX. The framework of CCVM is formed through the central coordination and synchronization at the optical line terminal and advanced coding techniques across different system layers. A cross-layer design of video multicasting on a single ONU-BS is first introduced for dealing with the multi-user channel diversity and short-term channel fluctuations, where the scalable video coding with multiple description coding (MDC) at the source and physical layer superposition coding techniques at the channel are jointly considered. This approach is further extended into the scenario that involves multiple ONU-BSs for cooperative communications to tackle intercell interference. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated via a case study on the employment of CCVM strategy under the collaboration of multiple distributed ONU-BSs.",

The proposed RamP architecture has special features of cost-effective low-power arithmetic units, memory bandwidth reduction, and dynamic power management schemes for handheld GPUs. The detailed design of RamP- VI is explained as an example of the RamP architecture. It adopts logarithmic arithmetic for power and area efficiency, and has a triple- domain power management scheme to minimize power consumption at a given performance level. The proposed GPU shows peak performance of 141 Mvertices/s and 52.4 mW power consumption when it operates at 60 frames/s. It shows 17.5 percent performance improvement and 50.5 percent power reduction compared to the latest work.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes two scheduling algorithms based on the Distributed queuing collision avoidance MAC protocol for WLAN systems with heterogeneous voice and data traffic. The proposed schemes implement service differentiation and an opportunistic transmission policy by means of a PHY-MAC cross-layer dialog. In particular, transmissions are scheduled taking into account the service class, the state of the wireless channel, and the waiting time of messages at the MAC. Both schemes achieve significant performance improvement in terms of throughput and mean message delay, and increase the number of supported voice nodes in the system. The two mechanisms have different performance behavior as they present a trade-off between efficiency and fairness among the nodes. The obtained results emphasize the advantages of the proposed schemes and the importance of cross-layer design in wireless communication systems.",

Similar to most security schemes, trust establishment methods themselves can be vulnerable to attacks. In this article we investigate the benefits of introducing trust into distributed networks, the vulnerabilities in trust establishment methods, and the defense mechanisms. Five attacks against trust establishment methods are identified, and defense techniques are developed. Effectiveness of the attacks and the defense is demonstrated in the scenarios of securing routing protocols and detecting malicious nodes in MANETs.",

Our research group leverages these prototypes for several funded projects focusing on issues including interoperable public safety communications, cognitive wireless networks, and educational initiatives. The device components include a general-purpose processor on a small-form-factor motherboard, radio hardware, touchscreen and LCD, audio microphone and speaker, and an internal battery enabling hours of mobile operation. We describe the selection of hardware and software components, identification and modification of the operating system, and development of an application programming framework that augments the selected radio software. We discuss trade-offs in the selection of hardware and software, decisions that proved to be stable throughout the lifetime of the project, issues that arose, and lessons learned along the way. Significant advances over the past decade have made GPP-based software radio a viable solution in many areas, and this work demonstrates that today's processors are capable of enabling a new generation of software radio in portable form factor devices.",

      "abstract": "The only way to quickly provide health and disaster recovery services to the large number of isolated islands in Greece is to fly there by helicopter. For this reason, there are 46 heliports operated 24/7 by the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA). Unfortunately, the Greek terrain is extremely difficult as far as provisioning of telecommunication means is concerned, so connectivity with the heliports is virtually nonexistent. This leads to reduced radio coverage, especially at low altitudes, severely impairing the heliports' operational capabilities. Moreover, heliports are unmanned and unsupervised, and there is no indication as to the weather conditions there. Thus, flight controllers authorize landings/takeoffs to/from heliports, normally a life or death decision, while remaining unaware of what pilots may run into. This article presents the design and implementation of a solution to these problems, contributing to flight safety and heliport maintenance/operation procedures as well as providing a working paradigm regarding the quality of satellite communication services for other air traffic control (ATC) applications.",

      "abstract": "A particularly severe attack on routing protocols in ad hoc networks is the so-called worm- hole attack in which two or more colluding attackers record packets at one location, and tunnel them to another location for replay at that remote location. When this attack targets specifically routing control packets, the nodes that are close to the attackers are shielded from any alternative routes with more than one or two hops to the remote location. All routes are thus directed to the wormhole established by the attackers. In the optimized link state routing protocol, if a wormhole attack is launched during the propagation of link state packets, the wrong link information percolates throughout the network, leading to routing disruption. In this article we devise an efficient method to detect and avoid wormhole attacks in the OLSR protocOLSR protocolol. This method first attempts to pinpoint links that may potentially be part of a wormhole tunnel. Then a proper wormhole detection mechanism is applied to suspicious links by means of an exchange of encrypted probing packets between the two supposed neighbors (endpoints of the wormhole). The proposed solution exhibits several advantages, among which are its nonreliance on any time synchronization or location information, and its high detection rate under various scenarios.",

This article provides an overview of typical all-optical reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) systems and their associated network issues. We describe a novel digital optical network architecture based on digital ROADM systems, which use photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to overcome many of these issues. Digital ROADM systems use monolithic PICs to integrate over 60 discrete optical components, including lasers, modulators and detectors, into a single pair of optical components, allowing cost-effective optical-electrical-optical conversion at every node. This also allows key functions such as service reconfiguration, add/drop and protection to be implemented in the digital domain, and enables de-coupling of service provisioning from optical link engineering, termed bandwidth virtualization. Finally, key deployment, reliability and operational metrics for PIC-based digital ROADM systems are presented.",

      "abstract": "The number of different radio systems is currently increasing in portable devices like mobile phones due to the wider range of applications that require an optimized wireless communications channel to different services or other devices. To make this cost and power efficient, the transmitter must be adaptable to several different radio systems while keeping the complexity and cost reasonable. This article presents fundamental circuit techniques to enable low cost, low power, and low complexity transmitter architecture by combining digital-to-analog conversion, up-conversion, unwanted sideband rejection, power control, and part of the digital image rejection filtering into a single mixed-signal circuit block. The direct-digital RF-modulator architecture is the basis for a software-defined radio transmitter. It was demonstrated against WCDMA system requirements, but the versatility and the performance of this architecture enables support for other radio systems, such as GPRS and WLAN.",

      "abstract": "Analysis of the techno-economic conditions warranting currently existing deployments of 1 Gb/s (1G) Ethernet passive optical networks indicates clearly the requirement for a support of legacy equipment, allowing carriers to take advantage of already deployed 1G ONUs while increasing the channel capacity for some customers. This calls for a complete coexistence of 1G and 10 Gb/s (10G) equipment, sharing the same physical PON plant. In order to achieve this, a number of technical issues must be resolved in a satisfactory manner, including the required extensions of the discovery process, currently specified in Clause 64 of IEEE 802.3-2008. In this article we present the existing discovery process for 1G-EPON systems and propose a series of extensions required to support the extended discovery process, which include detection of the upstream and downstream data rates, as well as an extension of the existing registration handshake.",

      "abstract": "The idea of time slot interchange (TSI), the fundamental concept of implementing time switches in digital switching systems, was first conceived by Dr. Hiroshi Inose, then at the University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1957 while he was a visiting consultant at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The TSI collects each subscriber's pulse code modulation (PCM)-coded voice information to be stored into a small time interval (time slot), and then aligns multiple time slots on a common transmission bus to constitute a repetitive frame. The TSI enables any time slot to be interchanged with another time slot within a frame once the time slots in the frame are buffered in memories. Thus, TSI gives the time switch functionality equivalent to N-input by N-output space switch functionality. He built a prototype digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) electronic switching system called CAMPUS, which is based on the TSI principle, using a magnetostrictive delay line as a memory device. TSI received little attention until the end of the 1960s because memory devices were very costly. However, with the rapid advancement of semiconductor technologies in the 1970s, the TSI scheme became more widespread. TSI was first commercially deployed in 1976 as the time switch of AT&amp;T's no. 4 ESS, the world's first stored-program control time-division switching system. Since then, TSI has been used in almost all digital central office switching systems and digital private branch exchanges (PBXs). Dr. Inose's contributions were not limited to research on such things as switching systems, PCM integrated communications, computer communications, and road traffic control systems; he was also actively involved in a number of Japanese governmental and international activities in the area of communications and information processing technologies. His final work was the establishment of the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in 2000, Japan's sole comprehensive academic institute in the field of informatics that seeks to advance integrated research and development activities in information-related fields.",

      "abstract": "The explosion of current demand has brought the contemporary multidomain core network paradigm to its limit. In the quest for new approaches that exploit recent developments in optical technology, a novel network architecture that obviates most of the expensive and loss-prone centralized all-optical switches is described in this work. It is based on clustered architecture for nodes in optical networks and features a reconciliation between dynamic resource allocation and guaranteed end-to-end network performance in a multidomain network. This article enhances the distributed, collision-free slot aggregation inside domains of clustered core nodes with dynamic switching of slots/frames between the domains. Thus, it can support dynamic sub-wavelength allocations between network domains, using standard burst-switching techniques. This extends the high efficiency and multiplexing gain into the inter-domain network even under highly bursty traffic. It features both low-cost optical add/drop edge nodes exploiting WDM transmission and agile and modular centralized electro-optical switches that are presented in conjunction with the overall network architecture. Its performance exhibits very low burst loss probability traded for a higher but tolerable and bounded delay.",

      "abstract": "Until recently, the proponents of spectrum commons and the proponents of spectrum property rights had settled, like the armies of the Marne, into their entrenched positions, emerging only to launch periodic and unproductive attacks across a semantic and philosophical no man's land. Recently, however, there have been calls to move beyond these entrenched positions, by developing pragmatic models and solutions that capture some of the benefits of each philosophical position. In this article we cautiously enter that no man's land with two illustrative dynamic spectrum access models. While both of our models retain a bias toward usage of spectrum resources based on a spectrum property rights approach, they also promote dynamic access and short-term dedication of spectrum resources. We call these models dynamic property rights spectrum access (D-Pass) and dynamic commons property rights spectrum access (D-CPass). In this work we focus primarily on engineering issues, proposing the use of a spectrum policy server as a clearinghouse and specifying the spectrum access mechanisms relevant to each model. To demonstrate the useful studies enabled through these models, we present illustrative results via the bandwidth utilization achieved under each model. Our results indicate that both the spectrum access mechanism and market forces will play important roles in determining the resulting bandwidth utilization.",

Nevertheless, they are vulnerable to network layer attacks that cannot be neutralized easily. In wired networks, firewalls improve the level of security by means of packet filtering techniques that determine what traffic is allowed, thereby reducing the impact of such attacks. In this work, we overview the requirements to adapt firewalls to wireless ad hoc networks and highlight the advantages of the use of filtering techniques based on Bloom filters.",

      "abstract": "In view of the rapidly growing trend of migrating customers from traditional wired phones to mobile phones and then to VoIP services in the recent past, there is a tremendous demand for wireless technologies to support VoIP, specially on WiFi technologies which have already matured commercially. This has put forth great research challenges in the area of wireless VoIP. In this article we have addressed two core issues, efficient silence suppression and call admission control, in QoS provisioning for VoIP services in WiFi networks. In this connection we present a QoS-aware wireless MAC protocol called hybrid contention-free access (H-CFA) and a VoIP call admission control technique called the traffic stream admission control (TS-AC) algorithm. The H-CFA protocol is based on a novel idea that combines two contention-free wireless medium access approaches, round-robin polling and TDMA-like time slot assignment, and provides substantial multiplexing capacity gain through silence suppression of voice calls. The TS-AC algorithm ensures efficient admission control for consistent delay bound guarantees and further maximizes the capacity through exploiting the voice characteristic so that it can tolerate some level of non-consecutive packet loss. We expose the benefits of our schemes through numerical results obtained from simulations.",

A control plane can be used to deliver dynamic circuit provisioning in the transport layer, as well as bandwidth provisioning and traffic engineering in higher layers. Globalization drives the quest for end-to-end QoS guarantees over different carrier networks. Recovery mechanisms are crucial to reach the high availability requirements of critical services. In this article, we share our vision on how to enable high availability services, spanning multiple networks using failure protection techniques while complying with administrative constraints.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a highly promising answer to the complexity and heterogeneity characterizing the beyond 3G wireless scenario. In this context, this article advances from the field of interference sensing to the fields of (basic) reasoning and robust reasoning. Interference sensing is concerned with the acquisition of interference related measurements for frequency bands of interest. The article describes how a cognitive radio system can reason on these measurements to obtain estimations for the capabilities of alternate configurations, especially in terms of achievable transmission capacity and coverage. Subsequently, it focuses on robust reasoning, namely, on enhancing these estimations by employing machine learning, which constitutes an important aspect of cognitive radio. Several relevant solutions are sketched and explained, with a view to providing a complete picture.",

In particular, it focuses on the emergence of features that have made Ethernet an attractive infrastructure technology option for carriers and network providers. These include the development of data plane maintenance protocols (OAM), and scaling enhancements, initially in the form of VLANs, then VLAN stacking (802.lad), and more recently complete recursion of headers (802.lah). The complete recursion of headers has led to the ability to decouple the infrastructure data plane from traditional bridging behavior while preserving other desirable attributes, leading to new approaches to operating Ethernet networks such as PBB-TE.",

Ethernet ring protection switching, defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.8032, provides a means of achieving carrier network requirements for ring network topologies. This article outlines the novel concepts in this Ethernet ring protection switching mechanism and discusses the fundamental operating principles by which the automatic protection switching (APS) protocol works. In addition, several feature enhancements in protection behavior and solutions being considered for the next phase of standardization are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Ethernet services represent a steadily growing portion of the fixed telecommunication market. To enable the provisioning of Ethernet services over IEEE 802.16e, the mobile WiMAX network architecture supports transparent Ethernet transport as an optional extension to the IP services architecture. Ethernet support is tightly aligned to the IP services network model, and leverages many data path and control plane functions from its IP sibling to keep the implementation and operation overhead low for the Ethernet extension. Mobile WiMAX provides IP services as well as Ethernet services over the same mobile access network. The intrinsic mobility support may create new deployment opportunities for Ethernet services. Initially, the Ethernet extension may be mostly used to realize wireless access for DSL networks based on the same network interfaces defined for the wired Ethernet-based DSL aggregation.",

With this in mind, two consortia, the SDR Forum and the Object Management Group, have teamed to define an open Smart Antenna specification. This specification defines a model (including an API) that simplifies the integration of an SA subsystem into a traditional SDR network. The specification is called the \"Platform Independent Model (PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM) for the Smart Antenna\" or \"SA API specification\". This article introduces the SA API, which provides a standard model and standard service of the SA system operating in SDR networks.",

      "abstract": "Rapid advances in digital technology allow people to have a single wireless device that has multiple functions such as communication, computing, and entertainment. These functions are generally embedded into the devices as add-on hardware components such as sensors, digital cameras, and so on. Currently, the functions operate independent of each other, since there is no unit that controls and coordinates the add-on hardware. However, with the aid of a cognitive engine, CR can take advantage of each component to improve its communications. In this work, location awareness is exploited to improve the wireless communication system design in CR. It is shown that several crucial wireless channel parameters are environment-dependent. In order for CR to relate a corresponding empirical model with an environment, the classification of propagation environments is outlined as well. The methods of characterizing the propagation environment for CR are also discussed. In addition, it is described how CR can carry out all these steps with the aid of a KRS along with RKRL and complete its adaptation cycle. CR networks are also discussed, including disseminating the location awareness information, propagation characteristics, and their effects on the network itself.",

      "abstract": "Telecom carriers have positioned IPTV as one of the key components of triple-play (broadband, television, and voice) or quad-play (with the addition of mobility). Adoption of Web services within a SOA framework as building blocks for developing complex media workflows is an important step toward reuse of media processing tools in an IPTV environment. A Web services approach also provides the capability to abstract network-based services for creation of composite services that can be executed in an IPTV environment. At the same time, adoption of a service bus provides a single point of integration for multiple services, and common features such as service registry and discovery, reliable message delivery, and transformation in a heterogeneous production environment. In this article we present an approach of media enabling the service bus to support offline digital media processes and composite service execution in an IPTV production environment.",

      "abstract": "Mission-critical industrial process control networks support secure and reliable communications of devices in a controlling or manufacturing environment. They used to mostly use proprietary protocols and networks. Recently, however, many of them are being migrated to IP-based networks to consolidate many different types of networks into a single common network to simplify network operation, administration, and maintenance, and reduce operational expenses and capital expenditures. Despite their wide deployment, most operators have very little knowledge on how to operate them reliably and securely. This is mainly due to the operators' unfamiliarity with various faults that occur on IP-based process control networks. The current process of detecting and diagnosing faults in process control networks is mostly manual and thus the operators detect the problems only after noticeable process malfunctions. This article presents an overview of industrial process control networks and discusses the issues of introducing IP technologies into them. We then propose a fault detection and diagnosis method which is suitable for IP-based process control networks. We also present the system architecture and implementation of fault detection and diagnosis system as well as its deployment at POSCO. Finally, based on operational experience, we have generated a failure prediction model that can be used to predict potential alarms.",

      "abstract": "The surest way to increase the system capacity of a wireless link is by getting the transmitter and receiver closer to each other, which creates the dual benefits of higher-quality links and more spatial reuse. In a network with nomadic users, this inevitably involves deploying more infrastructure, typically in the form of microcells, hot spots, distributed antennas, or relays. A less expensive alternative is the recent concept of femtocells - also called home base stations - which are data access points installed by home users to get better indoor voice and data coverage. In this article we overview the technical and business arguments for femtocells and describe the state of the art on each front. We also describe the technical challenges facing femtocell networks and give some preliminary ideas for how to overcome them.",

      "abstract": "The success of next-generation mobile communication systems depends on the ability of service providers to engineer new added-value multimedia-rich services, which impose stringent constraints on the underlying delivery/transport architecture. The reliability of real-time services is essential for the viability of any such service offering. The sporadic packet loss typical of wireless channels can be addressed using appropriate techniques such as the widely used packet-level forward error correction. In designing channel-aware media streaming applications, two interrelated and challenging issues should be tackled: accuracy of characterizing channel fluctuations and effectiveness of application-level adaptation. The first challenge requires thorough insight into channel fluctuations and their manifestations at the application level, while the second concerns the way those fluctuations are interpreted and dealt with by adaptive mechanisms such as FEC. In this article we review the major issues that arise when designing a reliable media streaming system for wireless networks.",

Cellular mobile radio systems have advanced from second generation digital technology with limited data capability to third generation systems with data transmission rates on the order of a few megabits per second and on to fourth generation systems with goals of even higher data rates. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on various versions of IEEE 802.11 standards and known collectively as WiFi, have evolved from having data transmission rates of several megabits per second to hundreds of megabits per second.",

The trust management framework, which evaluates the trust of participating nodes, is used to force nodes to cooperate in a normal way. We make an effort to design a robust and attack-resistant trust management framework for the future. In this article we describe the vulnerabilities of and possible attacks on existing frameworks. An objective trust management framework is proposed to overcome these vulnerabilities. We provide a theoretical basis and skeleton for this framework. The performance evaluation and security analysis are provided showing the effectiveness and robustness of the OTMF compared with existing frameworks.",

While SONET/SDH transport technology continues to evolve, there are now major standardization efforts to develop a native packet-oriented transport technology. Ethernet, long dominant in the enterprise, is one of the fastest developing technologies for the transport layer. GMPLS, based on mature signaling and routing protocols, is gaining traction as a transport control plane, providing fast restoration and supporting automation of provisioning. We will briefly highlight recent Ethernet standardization and then introduce the concepts and standards work allowing GMPLS to control Ethernet.",

      "abstract": "For future WDM MANs, optical packet-switching has been considered to be a promising paradigm that efficiently supports a wide range of Internet-based applications having time-varying and high bandwidth demands and stringent delay requirements. This article presents the design of an experimental testbed system for a high-performance optical packet-switched WDM metro ring network, HOPSMAN. HOPSMAN boasts three crucial features. First, it has a scalable architecture in which the number of nodes is unconstrained by the number of wavelengths. Second, HOPSMAN nodes are equipped with high-speed photonic hardware components, including fast tunable receivers and optical slot erasers, capable of performing speedy optical packet-switching operations. Third, HOPSMAN incorporates a MAC scheme that embodies efficient and dynamic bandwidth allocation, resulting in exceptional delay-throughput performance. The article presents the key hardware components by highlighting the challenging issues we faced and the solutions we proposed for the testbed implementation. Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility of HOPSMAN, the article describes the experimental setup and presents the results obtained from running a commercially available remote media player application on the system.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi access technology has become popular in recent years. Many users nowadays use Wi-Fi to gain wireless access to the Internet from offices, public libraries, shopping malls, homes, and other places. However, current Wi-Fi deployment is limited to areas where wired LAN is available. Due to its relatively short transmission range in indoor environments (typically several tens of meters), Wi-Fi coverage needs to be extended significantly to full coverage of a certain area. The wireless mesh network (WMN) is a practical and effective solution. In this article we present HomeMesh, an off-the-shelf, simple, and cost-effective WMN for the indoor home environment. HomeMesh is based on simple protocols, implementable in normal notebooks or PCs, and is compatible with existing Wi-Fi APs and clients (i.e., no AP and client modifications). To achieve better end-to-end delay and throughput, HomeMesh dynamically selects its access path based on the ETX metric. We have implemented HomeMesh and conducted proofof- concept experiments in an indoor environment. Our mesh solution is shown to be effective in improving Wi-Fi services.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio networks are supposed to be capable of sensing their operating environment (with little or no prior information) and learning to adapt their behavior accordingly. We note that such a cognitive process is inherent in human behavior as well. One application of these networks is in dynamic spectrum access. Human beings evolve by learning to interact with each other for survival, common good, economic gain, and so on. Can models for these interactive behaviors be used by nodes in a cognitive radio network? Will we then see cognitive radio networks evolve into some human societies? Will we observe previously unseen societal behaviors emerge as a result of random perturbations due to fading, mobility, and sensory failures? We also note that some shortcomings (e.g., inability to address irrational behavior) in using microeconomic game theory and Nash equilibrium to study interacting cognitive radio nodes may be overcome by using anthropological models.",

Development of requirements and usage models in the study group and task group is discussed. The lengthy proposal down selection process used by 802.11n is described and critiqued. We also discuss the expected time to develop a standard from a market perspective. An overview of the physical layer technology used to achieve the 600 Mb/s data rate is presented. We outline the medium access layer features employed to enhance usable throughput to over 400 Mb/s. The added robustness afforded by techniques in the standard and issues with backward compatibility with legacy IEEE 802.1 la/g devices are addressed.",

      "abstract": "Access to networked data and information services has taken on an ever increasing importance to users for business, entertainment, and social networking applications. Users want high-speed, high-reliability, and high-quality access to these information services to be ubiquitous and available when they are fully mobile. Having these services available in a mobile environment also provides additional opportunities for service providers to enrich their offerings with location- based services. This article describes the IEEE 802.20 standard that was developed to meet the unique requirements for supporting high-speed data services while at the same time supporting full user mobility. It is a standard optimized to provide (IP-based) broadband wireless (Internet) access in a mobile environment, thereby affording network operators superior performance (e.g., higher data rates, lower latency) and lower costs as compared to networks built using standards that are not optimized for that purpose. The standard includes an OFDM wideband mode and a 625k-multicarrier mode. TDD duplexing is supported by both the 625k-MC mode and the OFDM wideband mode; FDD duplexing is supported by the OFDM wideband mode. Both modes are designed to support a full range of QoS attributes, making this technology suitable to support real-time streaming service that has low delay and jitter requirements, as well as near-real-time data services, where low error rate can be traded off for delay. These characteristics of the 802.20 standard make it suitable to meet user requirements for wireless mobile access well into the twenty-first century.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio techniques are being applied to many different communications systems. They hold promise for increasing utilization of radio frequencies that are underutilized today, allowing for improved commercial data services, and allowing for new emergency and military communications services. For example, these techniques are being considered by the U.S. FCC for communications services in unlicensed VHF and UHF TV bands. Although traditionally these techniques are closely associated with software-defined radios, many standards such as WiFi (IEEE 802.11), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) already include some degree of CR technology today. Further advances are occurring rapidly. IEEE 802.22 will be the first cognitive radio-based international standard with tangible frequency bands for its operation. Standardization is at the core of the current and future success of cognitive radio. Industry stakeholders are participating in international standards activities governing the use of cognitive radio techniques for dynamic spectrum access and coexistence, next-generation radio and spectrum management, and interoperability in infrastructure-less wireless networks. This article provides a review of standardization activities for cognitive radio technologies and comments on prospects and issues for future standardization.",

      "abstract": "Network infrastructures within provider network domains, including the associated technologies and business models, are undergoing significant change. Ethernet is an alternative to asynchronous transport mode in both provider aggregation and core network environments because of its simplicity and cost efficiency. However, it still lacks many features that are required to meet the demands of carrier-grade networks. A number of recent research initiatives, such as IST-MUSE and Medea-PlaNetS, have promoted the development of a unified broadband access and aggregation network platform. The idea is based on Ethernet and features various access technologies such as PON, DSL, and WiMAX to name a few. End-to-end- communication is based either on IPv4 or IPv6. The communication procedures within the Ethernet domain ensure that QoS is provided and maintained for the IP layer. The overall service control is based on the IP multimedia subsystem. This article outlines alternatives for combining Ethernet transport platforms with IMS-controlled service platforms and illustrates how to implement the transport control functions required to ensure IP-based communications while maintaining QoS levels.",

The third-generation (3G) wireless networks aim to support mobile users with numerous Internet services. 3G standards organizations are developing IP multimedia subsystems (IMS) to achieve seamless integration between Internet and 3G networks. Moreover, the collaboration between IETF, 3GPP, and 3GPP2 is essential to the development of IMS for next-generation networks. This article first provides an overview of 3GPP and 3GPP2 IMS and illustrates the IMS requirements, architectures, and functional models. We then discuss potential scalability issues in IMS. This article provides guidance for constructing a robust and scalable IMS.",

However, with the use of end-to- end application layer reliability solutions IPTV services can be enabled over existing IP networks. In particular, application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC) solutions provide a straightforward and powerful means to overcome packet loss. Different solutions for different IPTV service types are introduced and compared. Selected performance results are provided to show the performance and potential of AL-FEC solutions for IPTV applications. From the results it is verified that even in non-perfect transmission conditions IPTV services can easily be deployed without requiring huge investments in new infrastructure and network equipment. Powerful AL-FEC enables high-quality IPTV services without abandoning the promises of the Internet: best effort transport and end-to-end reliability.",

      "abstract": "We describe two main technical challenges in terms of the network and application levels for mobile IPTV service. To support a multimedia- streaming application service over a mobile network environment, we present the IP/MPLS-based NGN architecture with fixed and mobile convergence and its challenge, which is basically to support QoS for mobile IPTV ser vice. To meet the challenges for application source levels, we focus on the relationship of user terminals and video streaming sources to support user-perceived QoE, based on high- quality service between heterogeneous terminals. The techniques to meet these challenges depend on the characteristics of media processing and terminal capabilities, such as LCD panel size, resolution, video coding, and so on, in the heterogeneous network environment. To have a relationship between the two different levels, the significant factors mentioned previously are required to deliver the bandwidth coupled with a user profile to provide QoS/QoE in assured seamless mobile IPTV service on client devices.",

While cable network spectral bandwidths are larger than their wireline equivalents, bandwidth-consuming services such as HDTV are quickly filling this spectrum, prompting cable operators to consider video switching options as a means to increase programming capacity. This article examines the cable video network architecture, and in particular new emerging technologies that can provide cable networks with the means to transition to an IPTV architecture.",

      "abstract": "IPTV represents a solution for interactive television-like services. As the NGN has gained attention for the IP multimedia service delivery platform, IPTV has been recognized as the way to provide the key value-added services. However, IPTV differs from typical NGN-based voice and data services by the fact that it combines three conceptually unfamiliar (until now) components: streamed video, Web services, and NGN-based service control. Another difference is in the sense of the quality-assured service delivery that in the case of IPTV is much stricter for two reasons: it is more challenging to meet an end user's satisfaction in the case of television services, and there are issues of quality- assured provisioning of real-time multimedia services in an environment that is best-effort in its nature. In this article, possible approaches to NGN- based IPTV services assurance are presented from the QoE and QoS viewpoints. Current environments and an overview of the standardization efforts are given. A proposal for a fully NGN-integrated quality-assured IPTV provisioning model is presented with an associated converged profile structure. The service-aware quality assurance approach is argued. The article investigates further NGN service delivery enhancements for quality-assured provisioning of IPTV services that until now remained unresolved. The objective of this article is to present the design of a realistic quality assurance model, establish the associated framework for NGN-based IPTV services delivery, and contribute to discussions and research activities. At the same time, the conclusions and the proposed models will serve as a framework for future efforts in our laboratory NGN testbed.",

      "abstract": "IPTV, an emerging Internet application, would revolutionize the entertainment and media industries; however, IPTV also has the potential to overwhelm the Internet backbone and access networks with traffic. To date, IPTV over P2P streaming networks has advanced significantly using two different approaches: tree-push versus mesh-pull. In particular, the mesh-pull streaming approach has achieved a number of successful commercial deployments. In this article, we examine the current progress in the research and development of mesh-pull P2P streaming systems. We provide an overview of the general mesh-pull streaming architecture and review various challenges, design issues, and interesting research problems in this approach. We discuss the construction costs for providing an IPTV service with service guarantees. We outline a measurement technique for monitoring the video playback quality of mesh-pull streaming systems. We emphasize that the future P2P IPTV systems should be designed to meet the expectations of users for quality-of-experience. We also identify a few other important issues for IPTV over P2P streaming networks, including the traffic pressure on ISPs, various security concerns, and the necessity to re-examine the most appropriate P2P architecture. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future P2P IPTV systems.",

      "abstract": "Telecommunications companies are under increased pressure due to competition from multiple system operators, and the changing communications and entertainment needs of residential consumers. These pressures are driving the telecommunications companies to design and deploy metro networks capable of delivering broadcast video and VOD services through IP-based broadband connectivity (known as IPTV). One important architectural consideration for these IPTV networks is the core layer 1 transport infrastructure that supports economical delivery of these high-bandwidth services. This article surveys some of the major layer 1 optical transport network alternatives including DWDM, SONET, and Ethernet-on-fiber as well as its passive WDM/DWDM (PWDM) variation. The article analyzes the architectural and cost performance metrics for these transport options, and explores the economic crossover points with regard to the key network and service parameters such as bandwidth demand, number of subscribers, network topology, and operational constraints. DWDM technology, when coupled with native Ethernet aggregation, is found to have significant applicability for IPTV transport networks. DWDM offers value in capital cost and operations, while delivering the required bandwidth and performance. Ethernet aggregation capability within the transport infrastructure adds scalability, flexibility, and cost advantage for the multiservice network applications of the future.",

This Annex extends the G.722.1 codec from 7 kHz audio bandwidth to 14 kHz, 1 octave better than the current ITU-T wideband algorithms. It is a low-complexity audio codec operating at 24, 32, and 48 kb/s. Like the main ITU-T G.722.1 recommendation, its main application is videoconferencing. This article presents the standardization stages from the definition of the foreseen applications and specification of the requirements to the performance evaluation. The adaptation and design of new software tools (included in the ITU-T software tool library, STL), and the utilization of ITU-T P-series recommendations (dealing with transmission characteristics and performance characterization of telephone transmission quality) are also presented.",

      "abstract": "It is estimated that ICTs contribute around 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. These percentages are likely to grow as ICTs become more widely available. At the same time, ICTs can be a major linchpin in efforts to combat climate change and serve as a potent cross-cutting tool to limit and ultimately reduce GHG emissions across economic and social sectors. This article looks at the potential role ICTs play at different stages, from contributing to global warming to monitoring it, to developing long-term solutions to mitigate its effects, both directly in the ICT sector and in other sectors such as energy, transport, buildings, and finally to helping adapt to its effects. The article addresses the efforts made by the ITU and its membership to develop new climate-friendly technologies.",

Business, governments, and academia use International Telecommunication Union (ITU) developed standards to bring products and services to market rapidly, build order in the marketplace, generate trust, and enhance safety. Manufacturers, network operators, and consumers benefit in terms of lower prices and increased availability by reducing technical barriers and promoting compatibility between systems. ITU is justly proud to be the world's leading developer of standards for information and communication technologies (ICTs). It is the oldest activity of the Union, dating back to its establishment in 1865. ITU provides its members with excellent state-of-the-art technical support and meeting facilities that can cater to groups from 50 to 2000. ",

The paper also discussed the implications of this new proposed rules. While this article is not intended as legal advice, there are significant implications that stem from these proposed new rules. First, the cost of preparation and prosecution of a patent application may skyrocket where the inventor has significant knowledge in their industry. Since the inventor may know of relevant research or the work of others in their indus try, there is a high likelihood that they may have knowledge of more than 20 references. The review of these references and the preparation of the required \";additional disclosure\"; could easily far exceed the cost of the preparation of the application. Second, these requirements may have further implications on the enforcement of an issued patent.",

Even for next-generation broadband wireless technologies primarily focused on the mobile Internet, special handling of VoIP traffic in the physical and MAC layers is required to maximize voice capacity. While Mobile WiMAX Release 1.0 and 802.16e have all the key features necessary to support mobile VoIP traffic, special attention is given in Mobile WiMAX Release 1.5 and 802.16REV2 to further optimizing VoIP capacity through reduction in the MAC layer overhead associated with signaling messages. This article focuses on features and solutions used in Mobile WiMAX and the 802.16 standard to support voice traffic and the expected performance in Release 1.0/802.16e-2005, as well as gains from optimization concepts such as persistent allocation added in Release 1.5/802.16REV2. In each case, MAP overhead reduction and the projected improvements in VoIP capacity are presented using typical industry accepted models and assumptions. The results show about 15 percent increase in bidirectional VoIP capacity.",

      "abstract": "Currently, digital television is gradually replacing analogue TV. Although these digital TV services can be delivered via various broadcast networks (e.g., terrestrial, cable, satellite), Internet Protocol TV over broadband telecommunication networks offers much more than traditional broadcast TV. Not only can it improve the quality that users experience with this linear programming TV service, but it also paves the way for new TV services, such as video-on- demand, time-shifted TV, and network personal video recorder services, because of its integral return channel and the ability to address individual users. This article first provides an overview of a typical IPTV network architecture and some basic video coding concepts. Based on these, we then explain how IPTV can increase the linear programming TV quality experienced by end users by reducing channel-change latency and mitigating packet loss. For the latter, forward error correction and automatic repeat request techniques are discussed, whereas for the former a solution based on a circular buffer strategy is described. This article further argues that the availability of larger buffers in the network enables IPTV to better offer new services (in particular, time-shifted TV, network personal video recorder, and video-on-demand) than the competing platforms.",

      "abstract": "In several countries manufacturers, operators, and public authorities look at WiMAX system as a viable technology to fill the \"digital divide,\" providing broadband services mainly in suburban and rural areas, but also in densely populated areas. Nevertheless, as a standalone system it will never offer global services, and to complement its capabilities, the utilization of broadband space-based access shared among users represents a scalable and cost-effective solution to offer wider area coverage, improved performance in terms of QoS, service continuity in case of terrestrial network failure, and long-range user mobility. Integration between WiMAX and a space-based infrastructure, composed of a combination of satellites and high altitude platforms, can be pursued in several ways. The simplest solution is based on connecting a WiMAX network by means of a terrestrial network terminating at a hub station connected to the space infrastructure. A more flexible solution should allow the WiMAX subscriber station or base station to directly access the space infrastructure. This article addresses the identification of suitable scenarios and a feasibility analysis presenting link budget results related to a subset of the identified solutions.",

The uniqueness of this architecture is that the IP multimedia subsystem proposed by the 3GPP has been used as an arbitrator for network coupling and real-time session management. Apart from the advantage of a cellular network user being able to enjoy higher levels of bandwidth over a WLAN, IMS also provides a common platform for unified session control, as well as higher levels of terminal and service mobility over a heterogeneous networking environment. The article concludes by presenting the potential of this model for service continuity during and after vertical handoff with simulation results for validation.",

While shrinking process lithography has been a critical enabler of this trend, we should remember that tremendous innovation in device technology, circuits, system architecture, computer aided design (CAD), packaging, and many other areas have been necessary as well. The exponential integration phenomenon has not been limited to memory and microprocessors: mixed signal and radio functions have also seen striking advances in integration over the last 20 years, from cell phones to wireless LANs, integrated \"system- on-a-chip\" (SOC) transceivers have become prevalent in the circuits conferences, journals, and in some applications have even made it into commercial mainstream products.",

      "abstract": "Telecommunication service providers are eager for the benefits of IPTV services to penetrate into the lives of their broadband subscribers. A few multimedia delivery methods, such as multicast and P2P-style data bartering, are investigated in an attempt to reduce the network traffic at the backbone while preventing quality of experience degradation. While delivering fiber to households is still in its infancy in most parts of the world, the download and play delivery scheme has been deployed as an interim solution for video-on-demand service until fullscale multicast IPTV deployment in order to handle heterogeneous residential access networks. QoS-controlled streaming IPTV (e.g., multicast) is only available to customers with high-bandwidth broadband access. The research community has been heavily focused on how to reduce network load at the backbone and has overlooked the importance of traffic impact at the customer premises, which is very closely related to the quality of experience. This article provides a traffic impact analysis and a discussion of network-centric quality from the perspective of customers using real-world commercial traces in various user scenarios. We also present an overview of IPTV delivery schemes and user behavior models from previous measurement work. Finally, we illustrate a bandwidth demand estimation method for D&amp;P scenarios.",

Modern access systems usually can satisfy delay, loss, or bandwidth requirements; however, design inconsistencies can lead to service degradation as the terminals move across different systems. In this article, the focal point is the satisfaction of service requirements during mobility and more specifically, how the emerging IEEE 802.21 standard enables seamless, inter-technology handover. Based on prior work and a well-known example of seamless mobility, the main seamless mobility principles are identified and used as the basis for further evaluating the potential of the IEEE 802.21 standard to meet the requirements of applications for minimum disruption during an inter-technology handover.",

IP-OFDMA) has officially become a major global cellular wireless standard along with 3GPP UMTS/HSPA and 3GPP2 CDMA/ EVDO. Mobile WiMAX is an OFDM-based technology available for deployment today, and new WIMAX devices come to market at much reduced cost than that of current 3G solutions. Currently over 260 service providers are deploying fixed, portable and mobile WiMAX networks in 110 countries. This article provides an overview of the mobile WiMAX system and its performance under various configurations, channel conditions, and types of data traffic. Furthermore, the article provides an overview of mobile WiMAX evolution. ",

      "abstract": "In this tutorial article we review different multicarrier communication methods for the physical layer of cognitive radio systems. There, secondary users need to dynamically and reliably determine spectral holes, and transmit data in these resources without interfering with other parts of the frequency band. To satisfy the first, each SU has to be equipped with a spectrum analyzer. To satisfy the second, it is widely accepted that a multicarrier modulation technique should be adopted. Moreover, to maximize efficiency, it has been recognized that the side-lobes of each subcarrier band must be minimized. Much of the attention in the present literature emphasizes on the use of conventional OFDM, exploiting the fact that fast Fourier transform (FFT) as part of the OFDM modulator can also be used for channel sensing. Herein, we discuss the performance of OFDM, and also introduce filterbanks for multicarrier communication and spectral analysis in a CR setting. Moreover, the multitaper method has been proposed as an effective method for spectrum analysis. Our article provides an insight into the pros and cons of these technologies.",

Among allied forces, improved network centric capabilities have been met with enthusiastic support as they are rolled out into the field. However, as military operations become more and more dependent on networks, it is clear that a host of difficult technical challenges remain. These challenges span all layers of the communications protocol stack and in many cases are representative of the complex nature of large-scale communications networks. This feature topic includes four articles that touch on important challenge areas ranging from network security to mobile ad hoc network design.",

      "abstract": "Enterprises are increasingly using Ethernet as the foundation for transforming their networks to Internet Protocol. Simultaneously, service providers are deploying Ethernet to exploit the demand for wide-area Ethernet services and as the infrastructure for new residential services such as IPTV. This is due to Ethernet's low cost per bit and ubiquity in local area networks. Recent years have seen the widespread deployment of IP/MPLS networks to address this opportunity. IP/MPLS enables enhanced flexibility over the same converged network for IP and legacy services, avoiding the need to build separate per-service networks. It also adds carrier- grade capabilities such as quality of service, traffic engineering, and resiliency, thereby enabling new multipoint services such as virtual private LAN service. However, using Ethernet for \";always-on\"; and other mission-critical services has resulted in new resiliency requirements, in both the access and the network core. Two novel developments address these high expectations by enabling significant improvements in service availability. These are pseudowire redundancy and Ethernet multi-chassis link aggregation. This article reviews the current redundancy mechanisms typically deployed in Ethernet and MPLS networks. We show how additional enhancements are required in both the network core and the access to the Ethernet service. We describe new pseudowire redundancy and MC- LAG mechanisms, showing how they work together to enable end-to-end protection for Ethernet virtual private wire services and VPLS.",

However, for NCW to be successful, it is imperative that the networks be designed in a robust manner with the capability to produce consistent predictable results despite the uncertainties of the underlying environment. This underscores the need for formal systematic methodologies to design and predict performance of such networks. The challenges of mobile ad hoc networking combined with those associated with the stringent requirements posed by NCW systems, however, are daunting, and thus no systematic design techniques for NCW system design exist. To address this problem, a joint project was initiated between CERDEC and Telcordia Technologies to develop the Network Engineering Design Analytic Toolset (NEDAT) - a toolset that applies network-science-based approaches to design MANETs for use in NCW. Rooted in formal/analytic techniques, NEDAT can be used to design MANETs for use in NCW given information about available resources and performance objectives, analyze performance of a given NCW network, and understand design trades.",

      "abstract": "Faced with growing fierce competitive pressure on all fronts and market saturation, traditional telecommunication operators are now struggling to find the breakthrough approach by which they may successfully reshape their role from network service providers to multimedia service providers. They are re-examining their voice-centric business models and deploying next-generation networks (NGN) for QoS-guaranteed delivery of multimedia quadruple play services (QPSs). To cost effectively realize these paradigm shifts, the existing \";stability-oriented\"; network operations and management infrastructure and processes should be migrated into \";service-oriented\"; and \";business-driven\"; network operations and management within the context of today's multimedia and converged business environments. In this article, I'd like to introduce Network Operations and Management 2.0 (NOM 2.0), which is an innovative next generation operations and management paradigm for telephone company business agility and customer value creation. KT recently proposed Telco 2.0 [1], a new role and business model in the IP world to create customer value. NOM 2.0 is a key component needed to realize the Telco 2.0 goals. Telcos need to transform their operations and management framework into a human-centric and highly intelligent and automated one, and become the market leader by providing an agile operation and management framework within ever-changing operations and business environments. I will describe what NOM 2.0 is and how it is being realized in my company, KT.",

The broadband orthogonal frequency- and code-division multiplexing system with two-dimensional spreading (time and frequency domain spreading) is becoming a very promising technique for highspeed wireless communications due to its advantages over OFDM. This article presents the basic structure and main functions of the OFCDM system. A nonsequential code assignment scheme is introduced. The novel detection method for the OFCDM, called hybrid multi-code interference cancellation and minimum mean square error detection, is described. The application of advanced techniques to the OFCDM, such as turbo coding and MIMO, is also discussed. It is shown in this article that OFCDM is superior to OFDM.",

      "abstract": "Spam over IP telephony (SPIT) is expected to become a serious problem in the near future. One of the main requirements for a SPIT prevention system is to avoid the involvement of the callee in the SPIT detection process, because this implies disturbing the callee each time an unclassified potential SPIT call arrives. Further requirements include adaptability to different deployment scenarios and flexibility to quickly react to new kinds of SPIT that bypass existing prevention systems. This article analyzes the requirements for SPIT prevention, provides a systematic classification of currently known SPIT prevention methods, and introduces a reference model for SPIT prevention systems. As an instance of the reference model, we designed and implemented an advanced SPIT prevention system, composed of methods that avoid unnecessary callee interaction and adaptive in order to be customized for different scenarios.",

      "abstract": "TCP performance enhancement in wireless access networks is an important ongoing area of research. It is known that the hostile nature of the wireless channel and the mobile nature of wireless users interact adversely with standard TCP congestion control mechanisms [1], causing a drastic reduction in throughput. This article surveys a selection of different approaches to managing TCP performance over wireless links, and presents the results of simulation and field trial results of a novel TCP performance enhancing proxy over diverse cellular radio access technologies based on the GSM, cdma2000, and UMTS standards. The proposed TRL TCP performance enhancing proxy has the advantages of being completely transparent to both TCP endpoints and tunable to different access technologies, and frequently achieves the maximum throughput available from any of the studied radio access technologies.",

      "abstract": "Rapid advances in wireless mobile network technologies and mobile handsets (MHs) facilitate ubiquitous infrastructure that can support a range of mobile services and applications in addition to conventional mobile Internet access. One recent trend is to effectively run desktop PC-oriented heavier applications on MHs. However, due to their miniature, portable size, MHs are resource-constrained and therefore, running these applications directly on an MH is not satisfactory given a user's expectations. To cope with this problem, this article proposes a novel offloading service that can seamlessly offload some of the tasks of a mobile application from an MH to nearby, resource-rich PCs (called surrogates). The system architecture and key components of the proposed offloading service are presented, prototyped, and evaluated. The results of experiments and simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of this offloading service for mobile applications.",

We identify four kinds of aggregation strategies: point to point (P2P), point to multipoint (P2MP), multipoint to point (MP2P), and multipoint to multipoint (MP2MP). Using an auxiliary graph-based model, we evaluate the performance of these four strategies for singlehop and multihop scenarios that aggregate at the path level. In the case of partial mesh networks with dynamic traffic, we observe the following: MP2MP outperforms other architectures by multiple orders of magnitude in single-hop scenarios; P2P performs best in multihop transceiver-constrained scenarios; and P2MP performs the best in multihop wavelength-constrained scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Often, Internet measurement-based studies have followed a three-step procedure: collection of network measurements; measurementbased model inference; and generalization of the results obtained to other scenarios. Indeed, it has been a general belief that certain internetwork traffic statistics, such as the most used IP addresses and port numbers, show a similar behavior in networks with similar features, and the conclusions derived from the measurements of a given network could be extrapolated to a similar scenario. This study makes no starting assumption concerning this issue and undertakes a \"spatial\" analysis of network measurements. The measurement set comprises a six-month trace collected by RedIRIS (the Spanish National Research and Education Network) at different monitored points across the country. Our experiment shows that, although the frequency statistics of IP addresses and port numbers follow a Zipf distribution (as expected), the distributions' characteristic parameter values vary significantly in a spatial dimension (i.e., across individual university networks), even when the profile of the networks' user bases are similar. In practical terms, this means network designers, analysts, and operators should not assume that statistics for Internet site and applications usage for one network may accurately characterize other networks, even when those networks have similar user bases and environments. Furthermore, we show that experiment durations of approximately 30 days are necessary for the traffic processes to display stationarity. Hence, in order to obtain accurate statistics on traffic characteristics of large internetworks using state-of-the-art measurement techniques, long and spatially diverse experiments may be necessary.",

      "abstract": "Traffic engineering in backbone networks is an important issue in supporting an appropriate QoS level to accommodate various types of traffic flows efficiently. Automatically switched optical networks and generalized multiprotocol label switching control planes are promising functionalities to achieve the sophisticated mechanism of interdomain traffic engineering. In this article we address dynamic operational scenarios to control IP traffic flows using the ASON/GMPLS control plane. This includes cut-through IP/MPLS routers and the rerouting of failed links through the tunnel of optical label-switched paths. This article presents an operational evaluation of traffic engineering. More specifically, we present QoS recovery for protecting high priority traffic using policy controllers and fault recovery of inter-domain LSPs over the JGN II network testbed. This article evaluates and discusses the feasibility of these operational scenarios using state-of-the-art optical switching and control- plane technologies.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the bandwidth management problem in differentiated-service-aware traffic engineering (DS-TE) in MPLS networks. In this context diverse bandwidth constraint (BC) models have been proposed to enforce bandwidth constraints for each class of traffic on the basis of the resource optimization objectives. This article is not aimed at designing new models but to describe the framework required to exploit the advantages of the selected BC model. In particular, we analyze the impact of setting the bandwidth constraints and aggregating the service flows into traffic classes on service performance and resource utilization. We believe that this issue is often underestimated, and the literature is missing an overall discussion and relevant solution that drives the network operator in setting up bandwidth management procedures. The presented strategy takes into account the performance indicators, quality profile, and forecast traffic to improve the fulfillment of quality of service targets and optimize network resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "Consumer network access links can become bottlenecks when faced with heterogeneous network traffic where real-time traffic from network games finds itself competing with nongame traffic for access to bandwidth. We would like to prioritize network game traffic over these bandwidth restricted links. However, the limited resources of consumer access devices make this problematic. We propose a solution whereby the classification of flows is outsourced to an ISP-based system. The access device is then notified of flow classifications and can apply a simple flow prioritization rule. We have developed a prototype of this system and found it viable in terms of functionality, timeliness of classification, and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Mobile WiMAX is a fast growing broadband access technology that enables low-cost mobile Internet applications, and realizes the convergence of mobile and fixed broadband access in a single air interface and network architecture. Mobile WiMAX combines OFDMA and advanced MIMO schemes along with flexible bandwidth and fast link adaptation, creating a highly efficient air interface that exceeds the capacity of existing and evolving 3G radio access networks. WiMAX networks, built on all-IP network architecture for plug and play network deployments, can support a mix of different usage and service models. While some consider mobile WiMAX as a candidate for the fourth generation of mobile networks, others view it as the first generation of mobile Internet technologies emerging from a wider ecosystem targeting to extend the success of WiFi over wide area networks supporting mobility. This article provides a high-level overview of mobile WiMAX technology and its evolution roadmap from both radio and network perspectives.",

A hybrid satellite-terrestrial network can provide a cooperative system in such a way as to provide high-quality seamless MBMS effectively. In this article we discuss two promising techniques that can improve the performance of a mobile satellite broadcasting system with HSTN. The objective of the first technique is to obtain diversity gain from independent signal paths; this can be achieved by using the space-time coding technique jointly operated on both the satellite and terrestrial repeaters. The goal of the second scheme is to obtain power gain by using a layered channel coding scheme with which a user terminal adapts to the channel condition. We demonstrate various simulation results for both schemes on the prescribed network structure, and the results show substantial improvements in performance.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this research is to study the application of Web services technology in distributed real-time data delivery systems, as well as to determine the appropriate contexts in which such a design can be considered. We focus on distributed real-time systems and more specifically, on distributed soft real-time systems, which stand to benefit most from the use of Web services technology. We provide a means to evaluate the inclusion of Web services-based middleware in real-time system design. The decision to use the standardized data representation and communications protocols of Web services can bring tremendous value and benefit to both the service provider and the end user of a real-time system; however, the temporal performance of such systems is a critical factor. This research examines the most significant general performance considerations applicable to such systems and more specifically, provides a model to be used in the determination of whether a given system configuration can meet a specific soft real-time performance target.",

      "abstract": "Power line telecommunications and various forms of digital subscriber line transmissions are recent and rapidly evolving technologies using the existing electricity power or telephone lines for data transmission at rates higher than 1 Mb/s. As these lines were not designed for transmission of high data rates, they produce noiselike interferences in the HF range. The intensity depends on the electrical characteristics of the lines (balance, match, screening) as well as on the density and area coverage of these new systems. Exact calculations are impossible at this time because of missing models for the new wirebound communication systems with respect to emission of radio noise in the HF band. Early measurements and estimations showed that radio noise from PLT and xDSL has the potential to cause problems for military HF radio communications and communication intelligence. A Research Task Group under NATO was assigned to study the issue and determine possible solutions. Briefly, the findings of the RTG do indicate that PLT emissions have the potential to cause appreciable degradation in the exploitation of the HF spectrum by military users.",

When applied to sensor networks, extra care should be taken due to their requirements for multihop communication with minimum energy consumption. In this article we first discuss potential problems with the energy consumption in sensor networks using IEEE 802.15.4. Then six representative categories of algorithms are presented. The algorithms reside in between the MAC and a network layer. All operations of the MAC are performed through the standard interfaces of IEEE 802.15.4 without altering the standard protocol. The energy consumption and latency of the algorithms are evaluated by analysis and experiments, and the feasibility of real implementations is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "This article describes several real deployments of passive optical networks (PONs, the most common form of fiber to the home, FTTH) in several parts of the world, some with incumbent providers, some with other entities. The networks and service models are described, along with initial experiences with providing service. PON describes a technology whereby video, voice, and data can be delivered to residential and business customers using fiber optics from the point of origination to the home. The point of origination is called a central office, or CO, in the telephone industry, and a headend or hub in the cable TV industry. The headend is the master point where all signals are collected for the subscriber interface in both directions. The hub is a secondary location that interfaces with the headend, and then radiates connections out to subscribers.",

      "abstract": "The article examines a possible way of improving the performance of the presence service within IMS networks without modifying the presence and group management enabler. This can be achieved by means of a presence network agent (PNA). The PNA has been defined by 3GPP in [1]; it is a new logic entity within the IMS core network that is able to publish the presence information on behalf of the presentity user agent. The PNA improves performance because it reduces the presence signaling load within the radio access network without downgrading the freshness and richness of the presence information. The article's goal is to provide the reader with useful information about the PNA and our experience with PNA implementation and deployment. We first describe the PNA concept as defined by 3GPP, highlighting the open issues still present in the standardization and the possible optimizations, subsequently we present an actual implementation of a PNA handling busy/idle states for IMS calls.",

      "abstract": "Much progress can be observed in the domain of Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) research looking back at the last decade. It can be seen that studies of vehicular communication protocols in the context of VANETs are typically based on simulation models. This approach has two major prerequisites: First, detailed network simulation of all layers of communication protocols is necessary as provided by a wide variety of tools by the networking community. Secondly, realistic simulation of vehicles' mobility, i.e., an exact modeling of road traffic, is needed to estimate positions and movements of involved components. The contributions of this article are twofold: First, a survey of the evolution of mobility modeling in VANET simulations is provided, outlining the simulation strategies typically used. Secondly, this article investigates how recent advances in bidirectional coupling of road traffic microsimulation and network simulation lead to more realistic results at comparably low computational cost. In conclusion, this article advocates to employ such techniques that are openly available for further studies of new communication protocols and mechanisms in the domain of VANET research.",

      "abstract": "Although provider backbone bridging is sometimes cast as an alternative technology to MPLS for Ethernet transport, the fact is that both technologies can be leveraged to complement one another in a service provider network. This provides the network operator with the best of what each technology has to offer in terms of scalability, manageability, cost, and flexible support for services. An example of the two technologies working in unison is provider backbone bridging interoperating with H-VPLS over networks with an MPLS core. The combined infrastructure leverages the strengths of Ethernet and MPLS with the added advantage of addressing the major shortcomings of standard H-VPLS.",

      "abstract": "Wide area communications technology has been challenged to virtualize large numbers of Ethernet LAN segments. This is a consequence of a mismatch between the broadcast nature of the LAN segment and the extremely constrained connectivity implied by the p2p connections or tunnels available in the WAN environment, which have been combined to create virtual LAN segments. PBB-TE has been a practical demonstration of how filtering applied to a broadcast media can result in a connection. This article introduces provider link state bridging (PLSB), which adds a control plane to the PBB data plane in order to extend the techniques for manipulation of Ethernet bridges for unicast paths pioneered by PBB-TE. PLSB solves the problem of largescale virtualization of LAN segments over an Ethernet infrastructure by applying advances in computation performance to the multicast capabilities inherent in the Ethernet data plane. The result is that the fundamental primitives of connectivity today, the broadcast LAN segment and the connection, can be virtualized in a scalable manner on a common (but substantially larger and better utilized) Ethernet-based infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "This work establishes a QoS-driven adaptive congestion control framework that provides QoS guarantees to VoIP service flows in mixed traffic scenarios for wireless cellular networks. The framework is composed of three radio resource management algorithms: admission control, packet scheduling, and load control. The proposed framework is scalable to several services and can be applied in any current or future packet-switched wireless system. By means of dynamic system-level simulations carried out in a specific case study where VoIP and Web service flows compete for shared access in an HSDPA wireless network, the proposed framework is able to increase the overall system capacity twofold depending on the traffic mix, while keeping the system operating optimally in its target QoS profile.",

Previous studies relied on simulations that paid little attention to how well these networks perform the tasks for which they can be deployed. Indeed, many authors employed random mobility models, although the hosts rarely move at random in real applications. Here, we assess the main ideas in the coordination literature in the context of extinguishing forest fires, with movements driven by application-level concerns and an eye on overall performance. The results reveal strengths and weaknesses of the most recent trend in coordination, knowledge exploitation.",

A novel, integrated, high-Q tunable digital capacitor is discussed to demonstrate how RF-MEMS technology can be utilized to make high frequency components whose RF characteristics can be adjusted during operation, allowing for the first time reconfiguration of radio hardware under software control. It is concluded that as the consumer wireless market continues to grow and evolve, product designers will remain under ever increasing pressure to develop smaller, lighter, thinner products that are more functional, energy-efficient, and intuitive, and to do so faster and at lower cost. Although issues and challenges persist, opportunities abound, and RF-MEMS technology holds the promise of being a key enabler of future generations of more highly converged, cognitive, and flexible consumer wireless products.",

      "abstract": "Since their introduction in 2003, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers have brought new flexibility and scalability to what was once a static optical telecommunications network. In five short years, ROADMs have become a mainstream requirement in core networks, and are an essential feature in metro DWDM deployments. As the demand for bandwidth and flexibility overwhelm the edge of the network, carriers are deploying ROADM-equipped nodes that are well suited for ring topologies. This is no easy task as new nodes must accommodate 40 and 100 Gb/s channel capacities, be economically viable, and be frugal in both power consumption and footprint. ROADM vendors have made great strides recently and are now able to take the ROADMs closer to end users with high-bandwidth applications.",

Innovations continue to provide society with capabilities we could not have dreamed possible just a decade or two ago. The news is replete with examples of the application of new wireless technology, from entertainment (e.g., video clips and games) to unexpected uses such as messages to supporters from political candidates on the campaign trail. Novel technology, enlightened wireless and telecommunication policies, and exciting (and profitable) applications can be expected to continue in a cycle that is highly beneficial to society. In this issue we offer some further ideas that we hope will continue to support this cycle.",

      "abstract": "Broadband connectivity to and within the home has been available to consumers for some time through various technologies. Among those technologies, power line communications is an excellent candidate for providing broadband connectivity as it exploits an already existing infrastructure. This infrastructure is much more pervasive than any other wired alternative (both to and within the home), and it allows virtually every line-powered device to become the target of value- added services. Therefore, PLC may be considered as the technological enabler of a multitude of future applications that probably would not be available otherwise. The most fundamental barrier to the widespread adoption of broadband PLC is the current lack of an international technical standard issued by a credible and globally recognized standards-setting body. Hopefully, this barrier will be eliminated soon through the work of the IEEE P1901 Corporate Standards Working Group. This group, which was created in June 2005, is entering a crucial phase. This article stresses the importance of standardization in the PLC context, gives an overview of the current activities of the IEEE P1901 working group, and also describes some of the technical challenges that the future 1901 standard must address to ensure the success of PLC in the marketplace.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a novel network architecture called resilient burst ring is proposed to implement the next-generation WDM-supported ultrahigh- speed (100 gigabit or higher) carrier Ethernet. This architecture inherits all the best features of resilient packet ring (IEEE 802.17), provides a burst-mode data transmission scheme through a two-sublayer (optical and electronic) hierarchy, and realizes the WDM-supported ultra-high-speed Ethernet with scalability and reliability. RBR adopts a two-layer buffering scheme to resolve the contentions of optical burst packets and provides three different data transmission modes. With the proposed priority-only-destination-delay resource reservation control protocol, RBR can provide a flexible QoS strategy to implement the transmission of all of the applications and services in existing networks.",

      "abstract": "The subject of this article is the long standing open problem of developing a general capacity theory for wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks. A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no preexisting infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. This article describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory.",

In this article, we examine the challenges of VANETs in sparse network conditions, review alternatives including epidemic routing, and propose a border node-based routing protocol for partially connected VANETs. The BBR protocol can tolerate network partition due to low node density and high node mobility. The performance of epidemic routing and BBR are evaluated with a geographic and traffic information- based mobility model that captures typical highway conditions. The simulation results show that under rural network conditions, a limited flooding protocol such as BBR performs well and offers the advantage of not relying on a location service required by other protocols proposed for VANETs.",

The system creates a peer-to-peer overlay network, which attempts to optimize use of existing capacity to ensure quality of service, delivering low startup delay and lag in playout of the live content. There are three main aspects of our solution: first, a swarming mechanism that constructs an overlay topology for minimizing propagation delays from the source to end consumers; second, a distributed overlay anycast system that uses a location-based search algorithm for peers to quickly find the closest peers in a given stream; and finally, a novel incentive mechanism that encourages peers to donate capacity even when the user is not actively consuming content.",

      "abstract": "As the wireless industry makes its way to the next generation of mobile systems, it is important to engineer solutions that enable seamless integration of emerging 4G access technologies within the currently deployed and/or evolved 2G/3G infrastructures. In this article we address a specific case of such a seamless integration, that of mobile WiMAX in evolved 3GPP networks. In this context we investigate the architecture and the key procedures that enable this integration, and we also introduce a novel handover mechanism that enables seamless mobility between mobile WiMAX and legacy 3GPP access, such as UTRAN or GERAN. The core characteristic of this novel handover mechanism is that mobile terminals do not need to support simultaneous transmission on both WiMAX and 3GPP accesses; therefore, it mitigates the RF coexistence issues that exist otherwise and improves handover performance. In addition, we provide a brief overview of mobile WiMAX and the evolved 3GPP network technologies, and we set the appropriate background material before presenting our proposed handover mechanism. Our main conclusion is that integrating mobile WiMAX in evolved 3GPP networks is a compelling approach for providing wireless broadband services, and mobility across WiMAX and 3GPP access can become seamless and efficient with no need for mobile terminals to support simultaneous transmission on both types of access.",

One of the main challenges in this kind of application is security. Due to their key role in WSNs and also their fragility, localization systems can be the target of an attack that could compromise the entire functioning of a WSN and lead to incorrect military plans and decision making, among other problems. In this article we show how current localization systems are vulnerable to these security attacks, and how existing techniques can be used to prevent or impede these attacks in WSNs.",

      "abstract": "Pervasive computing systems will likely be deployed in the near future, with the proliferation of wireless devices and the emergence of ad hoc networking as key enablers. Coping with mobility and the volatility of wireless communications in such systems is critical. Neighborhood discovery (ND) - the discovery of devices directly reachable for communication or in physical proximity - becomes a fundamental requirement and building block for various applications. However, the very nature of wireless mobile networks makes it easy to abuse ND and thereby compromise the overlying protocols and applications. Thus, providing methods to mitigate this vulnerability and secure ND is crucial. In this article we focus on this problem and provide definitions of neighborhood types and ND protocol properties, as well as a broad classification of attacks. Our ND literature survey reveals that securing ND is indeed a difficult and largely open problem. Moreover, given the severity of the problem, we advocate the need to formally model neighborhoods and analyze ND schemes.",

Now, it is well understood in the community that security and protection of private user information are a prerequisite for the deployment of the technology. This is so precisely because the benefits of VC systems, with the mission to enhance transportation safety and efficiency, are at stake. Without the integration of strong and practical security and privacy enhancing mechanisms, VC systems can be disrupted or disabled, even by relatively unsophisticated attackers. We address this problem within the SeVeCom project, having developed a security architecture that provides a comprehensive and practical solution. We present our results in a set of two articles in this issue. In this first one, we analyze threats and types of adversaries, identify security and privacy requirements, and present a spectrum of mechanisms to secure VC systems. We provide a solution that can be quickly adopted and deployed. In the second article we present our progress toward the implementation of our architecture and results on the performance of the secure VC system, along with a discussion of upcoming research challenges and our related current results.",

Nonetheless, their security and privacy protection is one of the problems that have been addressed only recently. In order to show the feasibility of secure VC, certain implementations are required. In [1] we discuss the design of a VC security system that has emerged as a result of the European SeVe-Com project. In this second article we discuss various issues related to the implementation and deployment aspects of secure VC systems. Moreover, we provide an outlook on open security research issues that will arise as VC systems develop from today's simple prototypes to full-fledged systems.",

We discuss our implementation of the secure AODV protocol extension, which includes tuning strategies aimed at improving its performance. Namely, we propose an adaptive mechanism that tunes SAODV behavior. Moreover, we analyze our adaptive strategy and another technique that delays the verification of digital signatures.

A challenging issue in this context is to guarantee end-to-end security mainly because sensor networks are extremely vulnerable to node compromises. We propose three schemes to secure data aggregation that rely on multipath routing. The first guarantees data confidentiality through secret sharing, while the second and third provide data availability through information dispersal. Based on qualitative analysis and implementation, we show that by applying these schemes, a sensor network can achieve data confidentiality, authenticity, and protection against denial of service attacks even in the presence of multiple compromised nodes.",

One of the ultimate goals in the design of such networking is to resist various malicious abuses and security attacks. In this article we first review the current standardization process, which covers the methods of providing security services and preserving driver privacy for wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) applications. We then address two fundamental issues, certificate revocation and conditional privacy preservation, for making the standards practical. In addition, a suite of novel security mechanisms are introduced for achieving secure certificate revocation and conditional privacy preservation, which are considered among the most challenging design objectives in vehicular ad hoc networks.",

      "abstract": "The success of platforms like iTunes has changed the distribution of multimedia resources. Multimedia resources can now be bought on the Internet and downloaded onto mobile devices. This coincides with the success of multimedia players and with the convergence between multimedia players and mobile devices. With ad hoc networks, mobile devices can extend the possibilities of legal distribution platforms by distributing multimedia resources even when no fixed network is available. This extension creates the need for solutions to perform authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) in ad hoc networks. In this article, we define a scenario and a solution for non-repudiation in ad hoc networks that enables accounting and charging for multimedia resources sold in ad hoc networks. A process was specified that guarantees non-repudiation for the selling/buying of multimedia resources and specifies how the collected accounting data are exchanged using existing AAA architectures.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of WDM-based optical transport has brought about unprecedented potential for ultra-high-speed IP core networks. It also holds great challenges, not least of which is to determine the optimal way of merging the optical domain with the IP domain. Beyond this issue, still a subject of research, the path to an efficient and resilient optical transmission IP core network is beset by numerous difficulties caused by shortcomings inherent to IP. Simply merging WDM and IP will not automatically produce a core network capable of serving the needs and adapting to the nature of diverse IP traffic. This article demonstrates the complexities of and proposes a possible solution for optimizing the next-generation core network, evolving the management plane IP/WDM integration model proposed in the 1ST WINMAN project. We concentrate on making the core network efficient for transporting differentiated service traffic, adaptive to changes in traffic patterns and resilient against possible failures, which would disrupt its operation. To these ends we introduce MPLS TE and DiffServ QoS functionality in our network model, thus ensuring maximum utilization of resources and automated guarantees of optimal quality for different types of transported traffic.",

It challenges some of the existing criticisms of simulation practices that emphasized validation aspects. This article advocates the use of simple models, matching assumptions and metrics in the problem statement and simulation to provide a basic \"proof of concept,\" and comparison with truly competing solutions, which is possible only after a thorough and critical literature review. Then the complexity of the models can be increased (one parameter at a time), revising the algorithms themselves by adapting them to new assumptions, metrics, and the corresponding simulation environment. Selected independent variables should explain performance under a wide range of scenarios.",

      "abstract": "A wireless sensor network should be able to operate for long periods of time with little or no external management. There is a requirement for this autonomy: the sensor nodes must be able to configure themselves in the presence of adverse situations. Therefore, the nodes should make use of situation awareness mechanisms to determine the existence of abnormal events in their surroundings. This work approaches the problem by considering the possible abnormal events as diseases, thus making it possible to diagnose them through their symptoms, namely, their side effects. Considering these awareness mechanisms as a foundation for high-level monitoring services, this article also shows how these mechanisms are included in the blueprint of an intrusion detection system.",

      "abstract": "Opportunistic unlicensed access to the (temporarily) unused frequency bands across the licensed radio spectrum is currently being investigated as a means to increase the efficiency of spectrum usage. Such opportunistic access calls for implementation of safeguards so that ongoing licensed operations are not compromised. Among different candidates, sensing-based access, where the unlicensed users transmit if they sense the licensed band to be free, is particularly appealing due to its low deployment cost and its compatibility with the legacy licensed systems. The ability to reliably and autonomously identify unused frequency bands is envisaged as one of the main functionalities of cognitive radios. In this article we provide an overview of the regulatory requirements and major challenges associated with the practical implementation of spectrum sensing functionality in cognitive radio systems. Furthermore, we outline different design trade-offs that have to be made in order to enhance various aspects of the system's performance.",

      "abstract": "After 9/11 and the accidental failure of the power grid in North America in 2003, storage area network (SAN) extension has emerged as critical to ensuring business continuity. However, SAN extension encounters challenges in the access network, including scalability problems, cost challenges, bandwidth bottlenecks and low throughput. In this article, we propose a new solution to address these problems: SAN extension over passive optical networks (S-PONs). To tackle the scalability problems and cost challenges, we designed the S-PON architecture based on the existing point-to-multiple-point (P2MP) PON infrastructure. To address the bandwidth bottlenecks in SAN extension, we propose three solutions for carrying storage signals with gigabit-level transmission. We also introduce a new device, XtenOLT, for implementing buffer pools by a new buffer-management scheme to improve SAN extension throughput and utility. Our experimental results show that, in the physical layer, the proposed S-PON transmission technologies successfully deliver SAN traffic to the long-haul at the rate of 2.5 Gb/s; in the network layer, S-PON with XtenOLT dramatically enhances deliverable throughput and utility over long-distance transmission.",

      "abstract": "Practical application of superposition coding in multiplexing broadcast and unicast for OFDM-based mobile cellular systems is discussed. Superposition coding, whose gain is increased as the superposed signals have larger difference in signal-to interference-plus-noise ratio, is well matched for unicast and broadcast in a single-frequency network configuration. Combined with interference cancellation technique, broadcast signals from multiple base stations can be cancelled in a single step, minimizing the interference from broadcast to unicast. Issues related with scheduling and strategy for time, frequency and power resource sharing between broadcast and unicast are discussed. The application of superposed broadcast and unicast is then extended to MIMO systems. Simulation results in a practical mobile cellular environment are also provided, showing significant throughput gain of superposed broadcast and unicast.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the evolving transport architecture, covering some of the synchronization distribution problems to many endpoints where mobile backhaul and TDM emulation occur. It shows how synchronous Ethernet fits into both the Ethernet and synchronization architectures, and discusses how this helped development in standardization bodies. Standardization allows the key building blocks of Ethernet silicon and specific timing devices to be developed, which allows a robust system implementation to be constructed while allowing interworking with and migration from existing SONET/SDH-based transport infrastructure. Finally, results are shown that indicate a very high level of performance is achievable with Synchronous Ethernet not subject to the normal packet delay variation and traffic load conditions that can occur in packet based networks.",

      "abstract": "Today, municipalities are planning to deploy metro-scale two-tier wireless mesh networks at a rapid pace. Fittingly, the IEEE 802.11s standard is being developed to allow interoperability between heterogeneous mesh network devices. In this article we describe and discuss how the initial standard addresses key factors for standardization of these networks: Efficient allocation of mesh resources at the routing and MAC layers. Protection and conservation of the network resources via security and energy efficiency. Assurance of fairness and elimination of spatial bias via mesh congestion control. We draw on examples from existing two-tier deployments, simulations, and analytical models to motivate these enhancements within the standard.",

We use three deployment case studies to illustrate the use of different technologies and discuss network design considerations. We identify the important factors influencing network design decisions and the future work in building Carrier Ethernet networks and services.",

      "abstract": "George O. Squier, the inventor of the Muzak system, was the inventor as well, in 1910, of telephone carrier multiplexing, the forerunner of microwave frequency multiplexing after World War II, and its current incarnation as optical wavelength multiplexing. Squier was a Major in the United States Army Signal Corps at the time, later becoming Major General and Chief Signal Officer. His invention was initially rejected by AT&amp;T engineers as not being commercially viable. This view was not shared by others in the engineering community, including John Stone Stone, a distinguished independent telephone engineer. After prodding by Stone, AT&amp;T officials began a reappraisal of the \"wired wireless\" system, as Squier chose to call it, and by 1914 development of a commercial system, was underway. By 1918, however, when the AT&amp;T system went into service, AT&amp;T was claiming that Squier's work had only been \"suggestive\" and that its system was based on inventions of its own engineers. We describe the sequence of events, beginning with Squier's invention, that led to the AT&amp;T commercial rollout of carrier multiplexing. We also offer some possible reasons, based on archival documents, as to why AT&amp;T downplayed Squier's invention.",

PONs, while still shared, are no longer confined to low bandwidths. Ethernet PONs in particular are due to transition from 1GE to 10GE soon, a substantial jump in bandwidth. However, this increase must be done in many cases over 1G networks that have already been installed. The peaceful coexistence of 1GE and 10GE PON traffic simultaneously in a network requires a robust discovery protocol.",

Working methods and approval processes are subject to regular review. Today standards (ITU-T recommendations) can be approved and published in a remarkably short period of time - in six languages and with tight editorial controls applied. Procedures have been fine tuned to ensure that work can be started in a new area in a timeframe which matches the fast-paced ICT environment to which ITU-T Recommendations provide a strong set of foundations. This article outlines ITU-T rules and structure for those interested in contributing to the work of the world's only international, intergovernmental standards organization.",

Work is being done to address these obstacles to enable the adoption of Web services technology in the future,, but where do we stand today? In particular, what can be done today to combat the often cited problem of slow response time for Web services? Although XML hardware acceleration and SOAP compression schemes can improve the overall response, the authors found that the appropriate selection of client software, server software, and data structures can have a substantial impact. It is possible to have a profound impact on performance using tools that are routinely and dependably available to us now.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by recent developments in the theory of complex networks, we examine the tolerance of communication networks for intentional attacks that aim to crash the network by taking down network hubs. In addition to providing a brief survey of key existing results, we investigate two different effects that largely have been ignored in past studies. Many communication networks, such as the Internet, are too large for anyone to have global information of their topologies, which makes accurate, intentional attacks virtually impossible; most attacks in communication networks must propagate from nodes to adjacent nodes, utilizing local-network topology information only. We show that incomplete global information has a different impact on intentional attacks in different circumstances, and local information-based attacks can actually be highly efficient. Such insights will be helpful for the future development of efficient protection schemes against network attacks.",

      "abstract": "The Series on Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks of IEEE Communications Magazine started an interesting debate on research methodologies and approaches in the April 2007 issue. Theoretical research and simulation studies are fundamental for understanding the behavior of phenomena, and their relevance is even higher in such areas as wireless and mobile networking, where experimentation is not easy to realize. However, there is a need to conduct these studies in a very solid convincing way. In the past issue we discussed the importance of considering realistic scenarios, since otherwise the results may lead to conclusions that will not be confirmed in real experiments. In this issue we continue this discussion by presenting other related aspects, such as the role of information theory and simulation, as well as the introduction of novel approaches such as knowledge exploitation to coordinate mobile and wireless networks.",

      "abstract": "The design of the control plane model for multidomain optical networks poses complex challenges and introduces many open problems. Some initiatives have proposed optical BGP (OBGP), which is an extension of BGP supporting the advertisement and signaling of optical information between routing domains. We argue, however, that future optical networks offer the opportunity to avoid inheriting the limitations of BGP, especially in terms of routing and traffic engineering control. In this article we present a route control model replacing BGP/OBGP. Extensive simulations confirm that our route control model is able to drastically reduce the blocking experienced with OBGP, and this can be accomplished without increasing the number or frequency of routing updates exchanged between domains.",

However, along with the service consolidation over IP and the rapid increase of network scale, the task of service and network management has become extremely complex and costly. Efforts are being made in various areas, for example, SOA, application-oriented networking, and autonomic computing, to achieve a scalable, secure, and self-managed service delivery framework to shorten the time-to-market of new Internet applications, as well as lower the management costs of service providers. Nevertheless, these technologies are not developed in a coordinated manner for optimal scalability, resource utilization, and QoS performance. In this article, we propose a prototype architecture and discuss related implementation issues for an autonomic service management framework, based on a holistic view of SOA, AON, and autonomic computing. In ASMF, a business or management application with end-to-end QoS requirements can be automatically composed from standard service components in a distributed manner and autonomically managed according to service level agreements.",

      "abstract": "Communications in a wireless network are susceptible to unauthorized traffic analysis by eavesdroppers. Although cryptography can protect the contents of communication, the transmission times of packets alone can reveal significant networking information such as source- destination pairs and routes of traffic flow. This article focuses on analytical approaches to anonymous networking for the prevention of information retrieval through packet timing analysis. In particular, an analytical measure for route anonymity is proposed using information theoretic equivocation. Based on the metric, provably anonymous countermeasures are described for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where traffic is subjected to strict constraints on medium access and latency. A key objective is to bridge a long standing gap between the information theoretic approach to secrecy in communication, and a more pragmatic approach of Chaum mixing used in anonymous systems on the Internet. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using an orthogonal transmitter directed signaling network.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a revolutionary technology that promises to alleviate the spectrum shortage problem and to bring about remarkable improvement in spectrum utilization. Spectrum sensing is one of the essential mechanisms of CR and is an active area of research. Although the operational aspects of spectrum sensing are being studied actively, its security aspects have attracted very little attention. In this paper, we discuss security issues that may pose a serious threat to spectrum sensing. Specifically, we focus on two security threats - incumbent emulation and spectrum sensing data falsification - that may wreak havoc in distributed spectrum sensing. We also discuss methods for countering these threats and the technical hurdles that must be overcome to implement such countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "The recently developed H.264/AVC encoder compresses video significantly more efficiently than previous encoders and is expected to be used for compressing the majority of video transported over communication networks. The traffic characteristics of encoded video have a significant impact on the network transport of compressed video, making it very important to study the characteristics of H.264/AVC video traffic. In this article, we examine the bit-rate distortion performance, bit-rate variability, and long-range dependence of the H.264/AVC encoder for long videos up to high-definition resolution. We also explore the impact of smoothing on the H.264/AVC video traffic. We find that compared to the MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2 encoders, H.264/AVC achieves lower average bit rates for a given video quality at the expense of significantly increased traffic variability that remains at high levels even with smoothing.",

The system has been designed as a service-oriented architecture where Web services and Web services workflows are the basic building blocks. Articulated private networks are presented as the first services built upon the UCLPv2 network virtualization middleware. APNs can be considered as a next generation VPN where a user can create a complex, multi-domain network topology by binding together network resources, computers, time slices, and virtual or real routing and/or switching nodes. A first implementation of the UCLPv2 software was deployed on CAnet 4, Canada's research and education network, and currently, it is being used by Environment Canada, a federal government department, to enable an APN that links its research facilities across the country.",

We propose to drive this evolution further with a new highly scalable architecture that provides features to users derived from the computational and networking capabilities of very large populations of sophisticated terminals. This architecture relies on emerging peer-to-peer overlay technology. We describe a peer-to-peer overlay design that addresses requirements crucial for consumer applications, including overlay federation, peer heterogeneity, peer mobility, and service discovery. In addition, we introduce the concept of an overlay operator and describe the requirements for managed overlays. We have designed and implemented both a middleware and a peer-topeer platform that illustrates these concepts.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a new measurement reporting method applied for HSUPA systems. The presented mechanism offers an efficient uplink quality of service, especially in soft handover mobility conditions. 3GPP specifications restrict mobility procedures (such as serving cell change) to downlink quality measurement reporting. However, with the high data rate introduced on the uplink in HSUPA systems, downlink-only measurements can introduce reporting delays or mobility decision inaccuracies, and thus throughput degradation. The proposed algorithm provides event-based uplink measurements for the block error rate quality on each radio link in the HSUPA active set. Networks can then use the proposed mechanism along with the downlink event-based measurements to trigger a mobility procedure. The results show enhancements to the uplink throughput and overall system performance.",

This article discusses the application of the adaptive coding and modulation feature of DVB-S2 in the provision of satellite triple play services over an interactive DVB-S2/DVB-RCS network in order to compensate for fluctuations in propagation conditions. A cross-layer resource management system is proposed in order to adapt the system to such fluctuations and improve its overall efficiency. Based on area-specific attenuation models, an efficiency study is presented, showing considerable capacity gains over static transmission schemes (DVB-S and DVB-S2 CCM).",

This article looks at this evolved framework with a particular focus on value-added services creation. Results from a sample performance evaluation study also are presented to quantify some of the achievable gains.",

      "abstract": "It is now clear that the latest evolution of the wireless communication system, for example, the ultra mobile broadband (UMBtrade) system developed in 3GPP2, has significantly increased the packet data efficiency of the system. However, as voice is still a major part of the revenue stream for many operators, voice efficiency is still of prime concern in the industry. A detailed end-to-end scheme for supporting VoIP in the air interface, designated for the UMB system, is described. Full duplex simulations were performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. The results show that the UMB system has significantly improved upon the VoIP capacity. A 5-MHz UMB system can support 320 VoIP users while simultaneously supporting a forward link data throughput of over 2.26 Mbps. Although more of the delay budget was expanded on the reverse link, the system is still reverse link limited.",

      "abstract": "Voice over IP applications in wireless networks have gained increasing popularity in recent years. As a delay-sensitive real-time application, a VoIP flow is usually given higher priority in accessing the shared wireless channel than delay-insensitive non-real-time flows. In contention-based wireless networks two widely used prioritizing MAC mechanisms are class-dependent arbitration interframe space and class-dependent contention window. In this article we propose an analytical model to evaluate the effect of the two mechanisms on voice capacity (the maximum number of two-way voice flow pairs supportable) of ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode wireless LANs. We show that the AIFS mechanism has a relatively strong effect on WLAN voice capacity in the ad hoc mode, but not in the infrastructure mode; and the CW mechanism, when properly configured, has a mild effect on voice capacity in both modes.",

We begin by providing an overview of the ZigBee technology followed by an evaluation of voice quality and performance over such an impoverished wireless channel. Two types of voice communications, namely full-duplex voice over IP (VoIP) and half-duplex push-to-talk (PTT) are considered. Voice quality of VoIP is measured using the R-factor [1] (a well known objective speech quality metric). The quality of PTT, however, is evaluated based on packet-loss rate, delay, and jitter. The simulation results demonstrate that a low-power, low-rate wireless sensor network can support a limited range of voice services.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a service-oriented communication (SOC) paradigm based on Web services for real-time communication and converged communication services over IP. This approach extends Web services from a methodology for service integration to a framework for SOC. In particular, we introduce the generic Web services-based application session management (WS-session), the two-way full duplex Web services interaction for communication, and most importantly, the development of Web Services Initiation Protocol. WIP is a full-featured Web services and SOA-based communication paradigm for multimedia and voice communication-over-IP. In the SOC paradigm of WIP, each WIP communication end point may be exposed as a UDDI-publishable Web resource, searchable by Web search engines, and capable of being integrated into a communication-enabled business process as services. We show that WIP provides a SOA that can be extended seamlessly from a primitive P2P end point for voice and video communication to an end point with advanced call control and switching capabilities typically requiring the assistance of a dedicated PBX. A prototype WIP system is fully developed. Architectural design and a system implementation of Web services-based communication are studied and applied to real scenarios of converged communication services. The advance of WIP indicates the beginning of a full Web service and SOA-based communication paradigm that can reshape the direction of communication over IP.",

      "abstract": "Femtocells are viewed as a promising option for mobile operators to improve coverage and provide high-data-rate services in a cost-effective manner. The idea is to overlay low-power and low-cost base station devices, Femto-APs, on the existing cellular network, where each Femto-AP provides high-speed wireless connection to subscribers within a small range. In particular, Femto-APs can be used to serve indoor users, resulting in a powerful solution for ubiquitous indoor and outdoor coverage, using a single access technology such as WiMAX. In this article we consider a WiMAX network deploying both macro BSs and Femto-APs, where it is assumed that Femto-APs have wired backhaul such as cable or DSL and operate on the same frequency band as macro BSs. Simulation results show that significant areal capacity (throughput per unit area) gain can be achieved via intense spatial reuse of the wireless spectrum. In addition, Femto-APs improve indoor coverage, where the macro BS signal may be weak. Motivated by the gains in capacity and coverage offered by femtocells, we review the state of the art of this \"infant\" technology, including use cases and network deployment scenarios, technical challenges that need to be addressed, and current standardization and industry activity.",

WAUN is a network for sensors and actuators, and can support low-end wireless terminals, which are expected to be used for new applications. Among the many types of R&amp;D being performed in the WAUN project, this article focuses on the feasibility of its basic feature and target. The basic feature is \"wide coverage using very-low-power-consumption terminals,\" and its specific target is a \"5-km cell radius using 10-mW transmission power terminals with a battery life of 10 years.\" The results of a basic field experiment and a laboratory experiment suggest that the target seems to be feasible using wireless technologies such as diversity reception (with additional future effort to improve the packet error rate for use in business districts) and LSI technologies such as a power switch fabricated in a CMOS/SOI LSI.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the outlook of the overall broadband market and operators' challenges in offering profitable mass market mobile data services. The concept of wireless relaying and its state of the art are then introduced, followed by a comprehensive description of a multihop relay system for WiMAX and related use cases. The article explains the impact of relays on network planning and presents an example of deployment cost analysis in different traffic scenarios and propagation conditions. Performance results show that multihop relaying is one of the most promising technologies that enables cost-effective enhancement of coverage, user throughput, and system capacity, and is especially suitable for the emerging markets and rural areas.",
