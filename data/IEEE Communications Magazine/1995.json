      "abstract": "The authors present a restoration algorithm designed for a ring-based multimedia ATM architecture, which is characterized by the simplicity of the node structure allowing flexible network configurations and an efficient bandwidth management. They show how easily reliable connections can be implemented within such an architecture. Basically, restoration is implemented by rerouting the protected traffic away from the failed component. The node which is located before the failed component is in charge of performing the rerouting. It requires only a few control flags of the routing table to be modified. This guarantees a fast restoration. The algorithm also allows an efficient use of the spare capacity.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The application of fuzzy control to adaptive traffic routing in telephone networks is investigated. The authors use, on one hand, the properties of fuzzy control techniques and adaptive routing, on the other hand, to derive a routing system that is robust and efficient. They analyze the impact of various availability indicators on performance, which indicates that the choice of a suitable indicator must be made to characterize circuit group availability. When used in the fuzzy control framework the indicator used appears clearly to improve the performance of the routing algorithm as compared to existing routing systems. On the other hand, the use of this indicator in a classical way appears to be of poor utility. The study compares the performance of methods usually applied to adaptive traffic routing and the fuzzy control approach and shows that the fuzzy control approach could provide an effective framework for robust control of traffic routing in communications networks. Research studies still need to be carried out to develop fuzzy adaptive routing on different network structures and to evaluate its impact on performance.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "When forecasting the development of new services, it is advisable to look closely at user demand and the way it is developing, to understand what is driving the changes in demand. Because of the varied nature of these new services, a number of different approaches to forecasting their demand can be applied. The growth in new services, as modeled in this optimistic scenario, leads to a massive increase in the volume of traffic carried by the network. This is not due solely to the growth in the number of terminals, but also to the availability of bandwidth at reasonable prices. The services would still exist if they had to operate over ISDN, but once ATM starts to be used, the available bandwidth allows application designers to incorporate the features and offer the response times needed to provide truly usable applications. This, in turn, reinforces the growth in demand.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) is an entity of the Organization of American States (OAS). Prior to 1993, CITEL was a series of conferences that existed in various forms over the years since 1889. The CITEL Assembly in 1993 organized CITEL into four permanent committees: a Permanent Executive Committee (COM/CITEL) and three Permanent Consultative Committees (PCCs) to carry out the work program of the Commission. There are a number of factors regarding the organization and operation of CITEL that are rather obvious. Probably the most important of these is the fact that CITEL must confront the future in partnership with the private sector in order to position itself to be of assistance to member states. With the increased participation of the private sector, it is anticipated that the scope of activities CITEL will be addressing in the future will also broaden. This is already taking place, especially in support of the establishment of a free trade zone in the Americas. One obvious step in this direction would be the expansion of the standards coordination activities into the area of information technology standards, which not only supports the trade negotiations but also the implementation of the global information infrastructure.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This allows the deployment of much more powerful and sophisticated resources than most users can afford while lowering the cost for each user by eliminating duplication of capital expenditures. Transmission costs associated with multiparty video conferences over wide areas are also lowered because of the connectivity advantages of network-based bridging.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) takes advantage of the existing twisted-pair copper loop that currently provides customer access to the telephone network. An ADSL modem is placed at each end of the loop to create a high speed access link above the existing telephone service. Since ADSL makes use of the existing copper telephone line, its application in the telephone network can conceivably be nearly as ubiquitous as the public telephone network itself. With ADSL, it is possible to connect small numbers of customers to broadband services in areas where full upgrade to hybrid fiber coaxial or fiber facilities is not economical in the near term. ADSL systems offer a means to introduce broadband services using the embedded base of metallic loops in areas where optic fiber-based, hybrid fiber-coaxial radio systems or other broadband transport systems may not be scheduled for deployment in time to meet business needs and customer demand. The article concentrates on ADSL systems capable of at least a nominal 6 Mb/s payload transport toward the customer, in addition to associated upstream channels and symmetrical \"telephony\" services via nonloaded loops that comply with carrier serving area design guidelines.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The synergy between digital radio communications and VLSI signal processing is revolutionizing the design of wireless terminals. Driving this synergy are certain fundamental paradigms in modern communication theory, digital signal processing, and VLSI design. The authors discuss the modern centers-of-gravity model, which they believe is emerging as the basis for the successful design and implementation of advanced digital communication systems. Central to this model are design principles that enable engineers to systematically derive digital receiver structures and explore algorithm and architecture trade-offs using sophisticated tools. Digital signal processing technology is critical in the implementation of these digital receiver structures efficiently. Finally, CAD tools for digital communications system design and design space exploration are shown to be of crucial importance in the efficient execution of these designs.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

We refer to the current approach as the call processing/broadband ISDN user part (CP/B-ISUP) approach. To illustrate the procedure description for call/connection establishment, we assume a network topology of three switches and one signaling transfer point (STP). The STP provides datagram routing for signaling messages. Associated with each switch is a call processing application process.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "This article describes an overall video network architecture with primary focus on the ATM subnetwork. The ATM subnetwork provides efficient switching capability for providing constant bit rate and variable bit rate video communication services. The ATM subnetwork can support multiple access networks like hybrid fiber coax (HFC), asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), and fiber to the curb (FTTC). A broadband network controller is presented as the external controller for the ATM subnetwork which performs the functions of the session/network manager and the ATM-based connection management. The initial deployment of video is likely to be permanent virtual connection (PVC)-based, so a dynamic PVC-based scenario is described. The ATM switch architecture presented here has been optimized to support video applications. An evolution to the switched virtual connection environment and support of multiple services over the ATM subnetwork is also addressed. Traffic management schemes are discussed which provide the negotiated quality of service to the connections.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) equipment based on fiber optics, SDH interfaces, and supporting operation systems (OSs) was introduced into Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)'s transmission-line networks beginning in 1989. One of the major problems in the first phase was less intelligent proprietary interfaces between network elements (NEs) and OSs, which caused limited connectivity among different types of NEs and OSs. A second problem was the lack of reusability of software modules for a specific type of equipment for other types of equipment. At the beginning of the second phase, the principles of the telecommunications management network (TMN) were adopted to provide good tools for defining standard interfaces and object oriented modeling. The article describes problems encountered in the first phase SDH network management system and summarizes advantages expected from making use of TMN-related standards available at the design stage of the second phase SDH network management system. It outlines the new SDH network management system, followed by results from the application of the TMN-related standards to real networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

For this purpose an optical network layer with cross-connect and add/drop functionalities will be added to the existing transport network. A comparative analysis of space, time, and optical frequency division multiplexing has shown that for the time being optical frequency multiplexing is best suited for the realization of that new network layer. This multiplexing scheme offers the greatest advantages such as very high bandwidth utilization in the fiber and simple and efficient cross-connecting of high bitrate streams. In the near future, technology will be mature enough for the realization of a demonstrator network based on optical frequency division multiplexing. The functionalities of the optical network are evaluated and the results clearly show that optical frequency conversion and regeneration should be provided by the optical network. The article also deals with the realization aspects (cross-connecting, supervision, and operation and maintenance) of an optical node.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The flexibility of the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technique to integrate diverse traffic using a single network platform, and the scalability of the synchronous optical network (SONET) to support various transmission speeds up to gigabit per second ranges, have contributed to the adoption of these standards in the future public telecommunications network. Presently, the networking of supercomputers and high performance workstations is widely based on the high performance parallel interface (HIPPI) standard. A number of efforts to allow the access of HIPPI networks to the public ATM/SONET network has resulted in different experimental Gigabit Testbeds such as CASA and Nectar. To provide the access of HIPPI-based local area networks (HIPPI-LAN) to the ATM/SONET network, HIPPI/ATM/SONET (HAS) terminal adapters could be deployed in instances where the cost of evolving the HIPPI network into a full ATM/SONET-based network is higher than that of a HAS interface. This article presents the architecture and performance of a 2.5 Gb/s HAS experimental prototype, which is a key component of the Nectar Gigabit Testbed. It identifies HAS implementation issues and presents possible solutions that can be extended to the implementation of future HAS devices. The HAS architecture is presented, as well as a discussion on flow control implications due to terminating the HIPPI protocol. The HAS performance is then shown through theoretical modeling and measured results.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Capital investments by network providers to develop broadband access for the information superhighway have inherent risks. Nevertheless, potential rewards to telephone companies, cable TV companies, and others for serving the end consumer in an expanding information economy make such investments a business imperative. This article focuses on the incumbent terrestrial access providers, the telephone local exchange carriers (LECs) and cable multiple system operators (MSOs). First, it cites the business environment and the information highway services that are driving local telephone and cable companies to invest in broadband access, as evolving technology and relaxing regulation enable the convergence of these two industries. Broadband access technologies are then reviewed and evolutionary paths from the respective embedded bases are considered, with respect to both today's choices and the long-term vision. The two choices for broadband access are loosely termed hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) and switched digital video (SDV). The thrust of this article is to explain why these two alternatives overshadow all others and to highlight the decision factors facing network providers in choosing between them.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The new networks and applications that represent the future of interactive digital broadband are not driven by technology alone. We should recognize that the true foundation of the future information networking business involves the uses and benefits that it produces. The applications that are driving the information age are numerous, coming from the areas of entertainment, enterprise systems, telecommunications, education, health, etc. The use of client-server distributed object computing technologies is at the foundation of all the software systems that have been designed and implemented. There are still many Issues to he resolved in the application of this software technology, but it is clear that we must rely on distributed software designs to support the features of interactive broadband services. Concerns over the ability to manage complexity and scalability in these large distributed software systems are a common thread and an indication that the technology still needs to mature.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The authors have examined the basic characteristics of hybrid-fiber coax (HFC) return systems to evaluate their ability to support bidirectional communications. The ability to support bidirectional communications on cable plants will allow deployment of two-way video applications as well as telecommunications services over the HFC plant. The results of the studies indicate that ingress in the cable return path is primarily due to broadcast signals which accumulate due to the noise-funneling effect of the cable return. Although this ingress can manifest itself in strong narrowband interferers which will prevent the use of large bandwidth channels, a reduction of node size to nodes on the order of 500 homes or lower will reduce the amount of interference. Filtering, in which a portion of the spectrum is blocked from the subscriber residence may also result in a significant reduction of ingress. Other phenomena on the return path can be dealt with by means of sound communication system design, including forward error correction to deal with impulse noise, and adaptive equalizers to deal with reflections in high data rate designs. TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA can all be utilized on the cable return path, but the capacities which result when less than perfectly synchronized CDMA is utilized are substantially lower than for TDMA and FDMA. A single carrier TDMA approach will be highly susceptible to narrowband interferers, and is unlikely to be successful. For these reasons a TDMA/FDMA or pure FDMA approach with narrow channels is likely to be the most robust multiple access technique for the cable return path.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "We are responding to the paper by Sari et al. (see ibid., vol.33, no.2, p.100, 1995), referred to as SKJ, in which it is claimed that single-carrier (SC) transmission with frequency-domain equalization (FDE) is generally superior to coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM) for terrestrial broadcasting. After pointing out a few additional considerations and briefly discussing the questions of carrier frequency offset and the effect of transmitter nonlinear distortion, we deal with the main issue: the performance of the two systems in the presence of strong echoes as would be encountered in single-frequency networks (SFNs). Any high performance communication system should incorporate sophisticated error-correction methods to achieve the desired performance. Therefore, a comparison based on uncoded or even trellis-coded transmission performance, as presented in SKJ, does not properly represent the tradeoffs involved in SC vs. COFDM terrestrial broadcast. A comparison should be based upon the most powerful practical coding system. For example, based on existing knowledge, a concatenated block and trellis coding system that incorporates adequate interleaving and maximum-likelihood decoding (using channel state information) offers a good solution. Using these techniques, we give an example of the performance of both kinds of systems with echoes ranging up to 0 dB. We find that it is possible to make the bit error rate of both systems improve with large echoes. SKJ reply that the basic message they want to convey through their article is that a well designed single-carrier system (with frequency-domain equalization) achieves similar performance to COFDM while avoiding its two well known problems of sensitivity to nonlinear distortion and carrier synchronization difficulties.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This paper presents a series of technology components that collectively form the basis for the Army's Battlefield Information Transmission System and will provide the underlying seamless, global, \"ubiquitous\" transmission system for the Force XXI warfighter. The technical and system architectures of the 21st century will evolve through a gradual process of development, acquisition, and experimentation. This process, by definition, is a combined effort relying on the Army Materiel Command (AMC) Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECs) working with the TRADOC battlelabs. The battlelabs, through a formal series of Advanced Warfighting Experiments (AWEs), play a crucial role in testing and adapting the technology produced by the AMC RDECs and commercial providers. Commercial technology is also directly exploited in TRADOC user environments as part of the Army's ACT II program.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The TeleWest Communications Group Plc., a joint venture between Telecommunication Inc. (TCI) and US West, have taken advantage of this opportunity to invest, operate, and assist in the operation of CATV/telephony in the United Kingdom. TeleWest owns or invests in 24 franchises, totalling approximately 3.6 million homes passed. Twenty-one of the 24 franchises wholly owned or invested in by TeleWest are offering competitive telephony as of the end of 1994. Others are set to start in the 1995-96 time frame. The article discusses the development of network architectures in support of TeleWest's cable/telephony opportunities in the United Kingdom. The article begins with an account of the history of U.K. cable/telephony, continues with the early developments and drivers of the architecture, discusses the current architecture and build, and concludes with an overview of future development and directions for the architecture.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "With respect to network timing, the introduction of SONET equipment into the public network offers both problems and opportunities. Wide-scale deployment of SONET equipment and the use of SONET line timing for reference distribution will eventually provide improved timing performance in terms of both wander and jitter. One of the main motivations for developing the SONET architecture was to establish standards for interconnecting optical transmission equipment from different suppliers. In the process of establishing the SONET standard other (e.g. synchronization) technical issues were addressed. The article compares the existing (asynchronous) network architecture with the new (synchronous) architecture in terms of their respective performance in transporting the clock rates of tributary digital signals. Of primary interest is the timing quality of a first level digital signal such as the North American DS1 signal or the ITU-T (formerly CCITT) El signal. Although the new architecture offers eventual promise in solving numerous timing and interfacing problems for such tributary signals, the new equipment must necessarily co-exist and inter-operate with the existing facilities. Thus, another major topic of the article concerns the performance of interim networks with mixtures of asynchronous and synchronous multiplexing.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Under objective technical criteria formulated by an all-industry Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service four digital systems were chosen. Each of the digital systems, however, had shortcomings which required further technical refinements. These systems were eventually combined into a single so-called Grand Alliance system.",

      "abstract": "Operational tests and demonstrations of systems based on software radios are currently being performed in the 800 MHz mobile cellular radio band. These field trials are for mobile unit geolocation systems and adaptive phased array \"smart antenna\" applications. The geolocation system trials are in response to the demand for high confidence geolocation of mobile units for enhanced emergency 911 service and for use in the US Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (NHS) initiative. The smart antenna array application addresses the cellular service providers' need for more user channel capacity and/or geographic coverage from existing base station installations. Software radio architectures were selected because of their ability to provide superior performance at low life cycle cost. These systems use 4 to 8 wideband coherent channels and fully characterize the arriving RF energy to either geolocate the emitter or to maximize the carrier-to-interference ratio.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

If this fiber is to be used with tomorrow's optically amplified, high-speed, long span-length lightwave system operating at 1.5 microns, the chromatic dispersion in the fiber must be compensated. Dispersion compensation will be required in long-haul l0 Gb/s systems using conventional fiber. Many compensation techniques have been demonstrated and they exhibit a variety of different and often complimentary properties. Transmitter compensation techniques are the most easily implemented but provide a limited amount of compensation. The most commercially advanced technique is negative dispersion fiber. Chirped Bragg gratings are advancing rapidly, but will always be hampered by their narrow bandwidth. The adoption of any particular technique for use in a high-speed network will depend on the constraints imposed by the, as yet, undefined network architecture.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In this article a method is presented that enables any network operator to create customized applications utilizing visual programming techniques. The advanced script construction method outlined in this article represents a script in the operations system (OS) as a linked network of templates for individual network element (NE) commands/Q3 operations and NE responses similar to a hypertext structure employed for the navigation through multimedia documents. The scripts are created by using visual programming techniques. The craft can interactively influence script control flow during its execution. This creates a vast number of options for script construction and virtually eliminates the expensive design and development of specialized TMN applications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The authors investigate the deployment of a state-dependent call routing scheme in a network where only a fraction of the switches can fully support it. The state-dependent routing scheme considered is dynamically controlled routing (DCR). Not all switches are assumed to be capable of supporting the feature that DCR requires. For switches that cannot support DCR, several alternative routing schemes are considered. These are: FHR, fixed routing (FR), and adaptive controlled routing (ACR). These schemes were selected on the basis of their modest switch requirements, which can be expected to be satisfied with no or minimal new development by the vast majority of existing switch products. The objective in the article is to define feasible interworking arrangements between DCR and these schemes and assess the performance that can be expected of a network operating under these arrangements. The authors begin by discussing DCR, and describe how it can be enhanced to interwork with non-DCR switches. They describe the routing schemes considered for the non-DCR switches, and how they can interwork with DCR. After that they analyze the performance that a network can expect to achieve when it supports DCR in its DCR switches in conjunction with one of the other routing schemes in its non-DCR switches.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The market demand for wireless communications has been demonstrated by the rapid growth of different second-generation wireless technologies that are optimized for particular applications and environments. Obvious examples include: digital cellular systems like GSM, ADC, PDC,and DCS1800 for widespread vehicular and pedestrian services, and cordless telecommunication systems based on CT2, DECT, and PHS standards for residential, business, and public cordless access applications. Efforts are also underway to consolidate the various radio environments and applications under a single standard for third generation wireless, i.e., FPLMTS. In the area of personal mobility, with the recent availability of \"personal\" numbers in various countries (e.g., 500 numbers in the United States), many fixed network operators are starting to offer such personal mobility services as \"personal number service\" and \"number portability\". These services represent initial stages of full personal mobility that will be provided by UPT in both wireline as well as wireless environments. The expected heavy demand for PCS in the United States and the underlying market/regulatory forces are driving the standardization and business activity. A number of air interface standards for the 1900 MHZ PCS band are being considered, which are based on TDMA, CDMA, and FDMA technologies singly or in combination. Many are variations of existing digital cellular and cordless telecommunications technologies. PCS networking standards are also being developed; both for standalone systems and for systems that will utilize public switched network capabilities.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This article will review technology and architectures that may be used to implement cost effective survivable fiber networks for each transport layer, and discuss the interworking system between survivability mechanisms across different layers and associated open issues. Standards development, product availability and the current status of deployment will also be reviewed. The first section reviews a class of survivable fiber network architectures that has been deployed or is scheduled to be deployed. Next is a review of emerging technologies for these survivable architecture implementations. These emerging technologies include SONET, ATM, and passive optical technology. Finally the issue of multiple layer interworking on SONET/ATM networks is discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Within the EC-sponsored RACE program, the IMMUNE project was established to analyze and specify appropriate strategies for introducing end-to-end survivability into corporate and public broadband networks to support these strategies by proper techniques and evaluation tools, and to demonstrate distributed restoration on PSN (public switched networks) and CPN (customer premises networks) laboratory models. The first objective was to define a set of survivability requirements and metrics to be used in the rest of the project. This has led to the identification of a range of survivability strategy options ann how they can be mapped onto user, service provider and operator requirements. The next step on the road to integral survivability is designing and planning survivable networks, and the evaluation of the restoration and protection mechanisms that will be applied in these networks. An overview is given of this part of the project. Most protection and restoration mechanisms operate within a single network layer and network part, autonomous from network management. The interaction of mechanisms in different network layers or in different network parts, and the role of network management, are discussed. For the demonstration lab models, two techniques have been selected for implementation: a distributed restoration mechanism for a meshed ATM PSN, and a CPN ATM ring protection switching mechanism. These techniques are described and an overview is given of the ongoing activities within the IMMUNE project, with a summary of the status of the demo models.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "European preparations for World Radiocommunication Conferences are coordinated within the European regional posts and telecommunications organization known as the CEPT. The basic objective of the European proposals is to achieve an even playing field for the introduction of competitive mobile satellite services that can provide global services from the earliest feasible common date. Europe believes the additional allocations made at the 1992 conference are sufficient for the foreseeable future, especially now that there is an opportunity every two years to make additional allocations should the need be proven. What must be agreed upon, however, are the allocations for the feeder links to the mobile satellite service to complement the 1992 allocations for service links. Europe also need to consider the technical constraints that were placed on the use of these service links at the 1992 conference. Of particular concern to Europe, is the most unsatisfactory conclusion in 1992 on the date of availability of the 2 GHz mobile satellite service allocations. The article describes the European proposals on these mobile satellite issues.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The United States Government advanced several initiatives to stimulate the commercialization of technologies. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 provided the legal basis for the private sector's access to government facilities and technical resources. In 1987, the Malcom Baldridge National Quality Award was established to \"stimulate American companies to improve quality and productivity for the pride of recognition while obtaining competitive edges through increased profits.\" Then, in 1988, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act entrusted the US Department of Commerce with the promotion of innovation. The cumulative effect of all these steps has been to involve the Federal scientific institutions, including the standards-setting organizations, in industrial and commercial activities. Particularly affected were two institutes under the US Department of Commerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). NTIA, which was formed in 1977, includes the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), located in Boulder, Colorado.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The cable television industry began deployment of this infrastructure in 1989 to support the broadcast video business. Recently, domestic telephone companies have looked at various degrees of HFC implementation, ranging from the delivery of broadcast video only to full telephony integration. The article looks at the HFC network evolution from a broadcast, non-essential, isolated architecture to a robust, interactive, broadband element within the public telecommunications fabric. Regional networks, interface to the public network and network management systems are a few of the significant issues with respect to the viability of HFC as the access layer to the \"information superhighway.\" If the HFC platform proves viable, telephone companies will adapt it to meet their needs in a fully integrated system.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Many telephone operating companies in North America, Europe, and Asia are moving rapidly to install this type of cable plant, both for its high capacity and for its relative simplicity and ease of maintenance. This is both to provide conventional telephone service, TV distribution, and the emerging information services that come under the information highway umbrella. In response, last year the IEEE 802.6 committee spun off a new group, Project 802.14, devoted to providing standards for the use of the HFC cable plant in supporting both traditional and new services.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The author describes the effect that the commercial sector is having on several research and development programs being pursued in support of this mission. The Department of Defence (DoD) must be prepared for conflicts that can occur anywhere in the world. As such, the commercial infrastructure must be considered as one of many building blocks for a global system capable of reaching any theater of interest. Thus, the DoD must not only develop the technologies required to extend command and control (C/sup 2/) into highly hostile environments, but must integrate these technologies with a commercial infrastructure that was designed to meet civilian market demands. This integration is discussed from three perspectives: the integration of the associated transmission fabric; the integration of military and commercial network management functions; and the seamless access to information across this global environment in a location-transparent manner.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "This article introduces various difficulties and issues in the basic scenario of integrating intelligent networks (INs) and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). As an example, implementation of Universal Personal Telecommunications (UPT) is considered. This article does not offer a comprehensive analysis, but rather a tutorial view. The separation of cellular networks and IN is not well suited to provide common mobility-related services. The present signaling systems do not enable transfer of mobility-related parameters, such as the cell identity and international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). A call connection to the service switching point must be set up every time IN services are used from the GSM network. The same information is stored in several network elements, and service creation and management are complex. With those disabilities in mind, two integration scenarios are introduced and their characteristics are compared. However, the aim is not to give detailed guidance for implementation, but rather to introduce different options and describe their most significant characteristics. It is important to be able to provide mobility-based information directly to the IN. Flexible integration calls for changes both in mobile exchanges and signalling systems. Mobile exchanges will be built with additional IN functionality and, in fact, future signalling systems will better carry mobility-related information. Mobility can be implemented with a rather small investment, provided that there are digital exchanges and transmission systems and the basic infrastructure has already been built. The required intelligence can be offered by using the existing Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or IN architecture.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The focus of this paper is to shed light on how neural networks (NNs) can be used to solve many of the serious problems encountered in the development of a coherent traffic control strategy in ATM networks. The main philosophy that favors neural networks over conventional programming approaches is their learning and adaptive capabilities, which can be utilized to construct adaptive (and computationally intelligent) algorithms for allocation of resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers), thus providing highly effective tools for congestion control.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "We describe the process of introducing new equipment for the telecommunications networks of the former USSR, taking into account our personal experience. First, it is important that we are dealing mainly with local switching, so the examples discussed are mainly from this particular field. Today the former Soviet Union is still a united country from the point of view of telecommunications (and telephony in particular). Though different countries have gained their independence, the telephone network is still united and built according to the same technical standards and regulations. In all the new countries; local calls are not billed as yet and additional services are virtually nonexistent, so it is impossible to generate revenue providing them. Local administrations need to install new equipment in order to upgrade their services, thus making it possible to earn more income from users. The three main sources of income are: installation and subscriber fees; payments on a per-call or per-time-unit basis; and payments for services and special features. Currently, the Republic's administrations are trying to increase the first item, which can be achieved by upgrading the old electromechanical switches and the analog network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Is Latin America going satellite by itself and is it managing wireless implementation via satellite to the best of its interests? Is Latin America looking for its role in the globalization of the world? Is it possible and healthy to think about regional or subregional models to lead Latin America wireless via satellite as well as its own means? Should Latin America be considered only a market, and nothing more? How will these questions be answered? To deal with these issues, currently \"fashionable\" satellite applications such as direct to home (DTH) and direct broadcast satellite (DBS), as well as rural and mobile communications, are approached from the marketing, legal, and regulatory points of view, including the \"sleeping\" plan for the broadcasting satellite service in Region 2.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Such parallel scrambling techniques are now available for frame synchronous scrambling (FSS), distributed sample scrambling (DSS), and self-synchronous scrambling (SSS), in bit-interleaved as well as byte-interleaved multiplexing environments. The objective of the article is to introduce the parallel scrambling techniques for FSS, DSS, and SSS, together with their applications to lightwave transmissions such as the SDH/SONET and the ATM network. It first considers the role of scrambling in digital transmission, and provides a brief description of the three scrambling techniques. Then it introduces the corresponding three parallel scrambling techniques, and finally demonstrates how they can be practically applied in low-rate scrambling processing of the SDH/SONET transmission signals, the cell-based ATM signals, and the SDH-based ATM signals.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Standards play a vital role in bringing an industry to widespread commercial use. Without standardization, interoperability of comparable systems and services is impossible, and economies of scale are never reached for manufacturing and investment. Historically, the standards are established either by a dominant player in a particular industry, e.g., IBM/Microsoft's development of DOS, or by coordination among multiple, non-dominant vendors, as was the case with GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) or UNIX. The present article delves into the existing and emerging standards in the mobile data industry, with Ericsson's MOBITEX system used as an example. It shows how wireline standards are being adapted to wireless, how this strategy compares to the development of new protocols and standards, and how the computer industry and its associated standards bodies are working to effectively hide the underlying wireless protocols.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Because of their high flexibility, ATM networks have the potential to achieve two objectives: switch cost reduction and multi-level network availability. For that purpose, this article proposes to use virtual circuit (VC) route self-healing schemes to achieve a multiple-availability-level ATM network. Flexible multi-QoS logical ATM network (Full-Net), a new concept for ATM networks, is now being studied at NTT Laboratories. Full-Net is a very flexible network design strategy for survivable networks that is based on a self-healing VC network. Defining several logical configurations of the VC network allows us to support multiple levels of network availability, simplifies the adaptation to future and unknown service requirements, and significantly reduces overall ATM network cost. Offering different levels of availability not only saves the network's resources, but also allows the network operator to provide its customers with services at the most appropriate cost. We introduce the advantages of VC route restoration for ATM networks, and compare virtual path (VP) level and physical level restoration strategies. We explain Full-Net's concept, propose a VC route self-healing scheme, and show the impact of the logical network configurations on network survivability and resource management.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In particular, we discuss some important issues in networking, traffic, and performance. Although within radio and networking aspects there are significant commonalities between traditional cellular mobile communications and wireless personal communications, there exist distinct differences due to radio propagation and fading effects, interference environment, smaller cell sizes, type and pattern of mobility, and call delivery. Indeed, with respect to networking issues, a large set of system choices, characteristics of traffic to be carried, and important parameters have to be considered. These include the problems involved in selecting an appropriate multiaccess technology to efficiently handle the required subscriber service profile across a multiplicity of systems to complete a call. To present a meaningful discussion of these issues, we address in some detail radio resource assignment, mobility management, call control, and traffic aspect, which have significant impact on the network performance.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The technology has also become of interest in the development of all-optical networks, and in this context the performance of WDM can be more critical. In some networks, multiple-access demands that a large number of channels be deployed over long distances, and in these cases the performance of WDM may be degraded by crosstalk arising from fiber nonlinearity. Other problems arise from non-ideal components such as optical amplifiers, switches, and multiplexers/demultiplexers, Much activity in WDM has been understanding its limitations and improving component performance, Some of the limitations imposed may be overcome by the use of OTDM, and research in this area continues to be of interest and importance. However, OTDM is less mature, and much activity is concerned with the realization of robust subsystems such as sources and demultiplexers. It is likely that in the longer term networks will employ a combination of WDM and OTDM.",

After a short history of, and rationale for the work in this area, a brief overview of the results achieved in ETSI's joint experts group on IN/TMN is provided. This includes the proposed mapping of the IN functional entities onto TMN function blocks and the proposal for integration of IN and TMN modeling techniques. This work has resulted in the \"Baseline Document on the Integration of IN and TMN\". Both ETSI and ITU-T have accepted this document as a starting point for further addressing the special requirements of IN with respect to management (i.e., rapid deployment and provisioning of new services and corresponding management functionality). The work on further alignment of IN and TMN terminology and concepts is an ongoing activity, as both IN and TMN concepts are expected to evolve toward the definition of open and distributed platform-oriented environments. The article also addresses this work program, the intermediate results, and the expected outcome of this continued effort on the standardization of IN management.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The first class consists of parametric statistical models that on average describe the phenomenon within a given error. They are simple to use, but relatively coarse. In the last few years a second class of environment-specific models has been introduced. These models are of a more deterministic nature, characterizing a specific street, building, etc. They are necessarily more time consuming to use, but are also more revealing concerning physical details and hopefully more accurate. Some key parameters and the measurement of them are discussed and then the different wireless environments are treated. The latter topic is divided into outdoor environments, indoor environments, and radio penetration from outdoor to indoor environments.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He examines the impact of public policy can on the communications industry and discusses the governments' dual roles in the evolution of telecommunication products and services. He also considers how government helped advanced technologies to come about, by funding fundamental research, and contrasts that with how government slowed those technologies' introduction, through various laws and regulations that didn't keep up with the times.",

In the future, there should be substantially increased domestic and regional use of satellite technology. The potential exists in this application for enormous increases in traffic, and the impact on developing countries' economies will be the greatest. In addition to the international links, several developing countries also employed INTELSAT capacity to establish domestic public telecommunication networks. Generally, these early domestic networks were set up in special situations where difficult terrain, climatic conditions, or territories separated by large bodies of water, made conventional telecommunications impossible. Subsequently, a number of these developing countries, including India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico, launched their own satellites to connect these networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

ATM networks can transport signals of various services efficiently and economically, and offer the benefit of enhanced flexibility if the virtual path (VP) concept is adopted. Therefore, the ATM network will provide the infrastructure for B-ISDN. One of the most important themes in B-ISDN is the increased level of network reliability required to to match the high volume of data transmission that will be incurred by the information society and the \"mission critical\" nature of such data. The authors summarize self-healing network (SHN) schemes they have developed, and discuss problems that must be solved to realize SHN.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Using bounds and approximations, we find that the key parameter to estimate is the number of location updates between two calls. The results are dependent upon the choice of protocols, but are independent of the traffic parameters relating user calling behavior and mobility. We use the framework to draw general conclusions about signaling load, as well as to compare the signaling loads for the European and North American systems and demonstrate the impact of architectural tradeoffs. We also describe the message flows for the major contributors to the signaling load that are defined in the GSM system.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This is a sea change in FCC policy and it should be continued. Spectrum flexibility contains two primary components, service flexibility and technical flexibility. With service flexibility, a provider would be allowed to use spectrum to provide any service subject to the technical limitations of the frequency. With technical flexibility, a licensee would be allowed to use any technology to provide its service subject to limitations on interference to other users and regulations to prevent health effects. Both dimensions are important to achieve a competitive telecommunications world.",

      "abstract": "The proper allocation of spectrum between the federal users and the private sector has become a central issue. The author describes how the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) ensures that federal spectrum is used efficiently and continues to identify spectrum for reallocation to the private sector. The NTIA also promotes policies to ensure efficient spectrum usage by the private sector. For example, NTIA was one of the principal proponents urging Congress to give the FCC auction authority. The NTIA has also proposed a spectrum auction methodology to the FCC that would generate higher auction revenues and a more efficient assignment of licenses. NTIA believes that it can make additional contributions in this area to enhance the future revenue potential of the auction process. He emphasizes that to evaluate fully the potential for raising revenue from reallocation of additional federal spectrum to the private sector, one must understand the difficult trade-offs involved. Federal agencies use spectrum to provide critical public services, and, there is virtually no prime spectrum lying fallow. In addition, international treaty allocations and obligations must be taken into account.",

      "abstract": "The greatest single factor in enhancing spectral efficiency of a network is the mass deployment of microcells. By this simple technique we can repeatedly and efficiently reuse the precious spectrum. The number of users a network can support is fundamentally dependent on the common air interface (CAI) over which users communicate. User capacity is dependent on many factors, but the cardinal ones are the amount of spectrum the regulators allocate, the size of the radio coverage area from a base station (BS), and the amount of interference a particular radio link can tolerate. In this article we are primarily concerned with the system aspects associated with the CAI. We focus on the critical importance of BS siting. Starting with existing large cells, we deliberate on the problems that might arise in siting BSs in three dimensional microcells, in order to consider suitable multiple access methods for future cellular environments.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "ATM has rapidly transitioned from a standards and prototyping concept to become the next-generation switching technology used in products available on the market. With the rapid introduction of ATM switches into networks, there is an urgent need to manage them. The article discusses the telecommunication management network (TMN) interfaces being defined for management systems to communicate with ATM network elements (NEs) and other management systems. ATM management systems will have to communicate with ATM NEs in their jurisdiction using TMN interfaces. Networks will usually contain equipment from different suppliers. Thus, it is vital that there be standard management interfaces so that these different NEs can be managed. Some standard interfaces for ATM networks are defined, while others are being defined. The status of these interfaces is reviewed in the article. Communication between different networks is also needed, both between public networks and between public and private networks. Management personnel of one network need to exchange information with other networks for certain functions (e.g., initial service provisioning), and so management systems of different networks will exchange information through a combination of mechanized and manual interfaces. The status of these interfaces is also reviewed in the article.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This value must therefore be taken into account in the allocation decisions and must be revealed to the users of the resource, irrespective of whether they are private or public entities. In terms of general principles, all countries acknowledge the need for greater flexibility in the current allocation procedures so that the frequency bands can be reallocated relatively speedily when necessary without jeopardizing long-term planning objectives. We study several methods of allocation which are complementary or alternative to the current system: the market, auctions, frequency coordination, lotteries, and user fees.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Another goal stated in the Master Plan is to have 48 main lines per 100 inhabitants by the year 2005. In addition, the Ministry decided to issue one license for operating a national paging network in 1995. This network must cover most of Lithuania. The number of licenses for local paging networks will not be limited.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The TMN principles aim at being applicable across telecommunications technologies. They recommend the use of independent management networks to manage telecommunications networks, elements in the telecommunications networks (managed networks), and managing systems (in managing networks), communicating via well defined, standardized interfaces. The standards bodies envisioned TMN as a possible solution to the complex problem of telecommunications networks and services operation, administration, maintenance and provisioning (OAM and P) in the open, multivendor environment. However, the vision stumbles against the reality. Various factors still hinder the implementation of TMN-based OAM and P systems. The present article provides a tutorial on TMN by contrasting the vision and the reality.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Personal communications will put new demands on INs. The architectures of existing INs may need to be modified to accommodate the new capabilities required to support such services. In particular, the databases that put the \"intelligence\" in IN will have many more demands placed upon them due to the changes in scope and content. We identify some of the teletraffic and architectural issues associated with the support of personal and mobile communications by IN databases. We first provide some context by reviewing IN architecture, personal communications, and the data required to support it. We then look at a pseudoservice example to better understand the implications for query and update traffic that must be handled by the databases. We also identify same of the most important issues that must be addressed by database manufacturers and IN providers to realize the promise of truly transparent personal and terminal mobility.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The teletraffic simulations have the essential elements of GSM900 and DCS1800, but they are not be exact simulations of these two systems. The approach is to site microcellular base stations, using the microcellular prediction tool MIDAS, into a fictitious city and into parts of two real cities. The radio coverage plots are then imported into a teletraffic simulator TELSIM. The simulator is loaded with the basic GSM900 and DCS1800 parameters to give an indication of the teletraffic performance of these systems in the three environments.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The Multicast Backbone (MBONE) frequently carries meetings of the Internet community and special events such as Space Shuttle launchings. It is beginning to be used for workshops and other professional gatherings. Making one of its major conferences available through MBONE was a first for the Communications Society and a cooperative effort by many people that relied on the generous loan of equipment and staff members by a number of companies. A special satellite data connection extended MBONE from the United States to Brazil. The authors report on how it was done and what it means for the Communications Society.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The architecture is based on distributed computing, object orientation, and other concepts and standards from the telecommunications as well as the computer industry, e.g., ODP, IN, TMN, and CORBA. It is applicable to various networks, broadband (e.g., ATM) or narrowband. A large part of the TINA consortium's activity is devoted to validating the TINA architecture's current specifications through auxiliary projects, collaborative worldwide demonstrations, and implementations carried out by the consortium's core team.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This article provides a tutorial review of software radio architectures and technology, highlighting benefits, pitfalls, and lessons learned. This includes a closer look at the canonical functional partitioning of channel coding into antenna, RF, IF, baseband, and bitstream segments. A more detailed look at the estimation of demand for critical resources is key. This leads to a discussion of affordable hardware configurations, the mapping of functions to component hardware, and related software tools. This article then concludes with a brief treatment of the economics and likely future directions of software radio technology.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

That article examined spread spectrum, standard radio and infrared (IR) technologies for intra-office wireless networking. In May of that year the FCC released the ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands for spread spectrum local communications. Although ISM bands are not restricted to any specific application, wireless local area networks (LANs) were one of the most prominent applications that were envisioned by the rule makers in the FCC. Since 1985, many small start-up companies, as well as small groups in larger companies, have started to develop wireless LANs. The present paper provides a sequel to Pahlavan by providing an overview of the past and present of the wireless LAN industry, as well as a perspective of the future directions that encompass a vision for a ubiquitous local wireless computing environment that leads to a fusion of communications and computation.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The model proposed by the author allows for changing the cell size for different services and the number of users. The cell size that will ensure the best possible performance and quality of service can be derived by the model. The main task of a telecommunication system is call processing. This includes identifying incoming calls, establishing a communication path for the duration of the connection, and disconnecting the call after the conversation has ended. Call processing uses different components of the software architecture and involves processes and messages performing different functions and accessing various resources. In addition, the system requires administration and maintenance that also involves processes using different resources.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
