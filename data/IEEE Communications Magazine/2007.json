   "abstract": "In recent years, multimedia content broadcasting via satellite has attracted increased attention. The satellite digital multimedia broadcasting (S-DMB) system has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives for the efficient delivery of multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS). The design of an efficient radio resource management (RRM) strategy, especially the packet scheduling scheme, becomes a key technique for provisioning multimedia services at required quality of service (QoS) in S-DMB. In this article, we propose a novel cross-layer packet scheduling scheme that consists of a combined delay and rate differentiation (CDRD) service prioritization algorithm and a dynamic rate matching (DRM)-based resource allocation algorithm. The proposed scheme considers multiple key factors that span from the application layer to the physical layer, aiming at simultaneously guaranteeing diverse QoS while utilizing radio resources efficiently under the system power and resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer scheme achieves significantly better performance than existing schemes in queuing delay, jitter, and channel utilization.",

This article introduces the network plane (NP) and parallel Internets (PI) concepts for achieving service differentiation. Based on these concepts, a functional architecture together with a business model is presented. In addition, this article describes how the proposed approach can become a promising platform for the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), with the objective of providing end-to-end QoS-enabled multimedia delivery across multiple providers to replace the flow-based reservation mode known as the VoIP resource reservation framework.",

   "abstract": "In the information age, spectrum is a valuable natural resource. Currently, there is a great deal of ongoing research into architectures for spectrum (or more generally, radio resource) management for next generation wireless communications systems. This article proposes a framework for unified spectrum management (USM), where both licensed and license-exempt bands are managed by a hierarchical band management method. An outline for developing the required entities in this architecture is introduced, as well as the protocols that are required for USM operation. We also discuss spatial and temporal coordination of resource usage in such a heterogeneous wireless environment. Finally, a number of open research issues for future study are outlined.",

   "abstract": "Integration of different wireless radio cellular technologies is emerging as an effective approach to accommodate the increasing demand of next-generation multimedia-based applications. In such systems user roaming among different technologies, commonly known as vertical handoff, will significantly affect different aspects of network design and planning due to the characteristically wide-ranging diversity in access technologies and supported applications. Hence, the development of new mobility models that accurately depict vertical mobility is crucial for studying different design problems in these heterogeneous systems. This article presents a generic framework for mobility modeling and performance analysis of integrated heterogeneous networks using phase-type distributions. This framework realizes all modeling requirements in next-generation user mobility including accuracy, analytical tractability, and accommodating the correlation between different residence times within different access technologies. Additionally, we present general guidelines to evaluate application performance based on the new mobility models introduced in this article. We show the accuracy of our modeling approach through simulation and analysis given different applications.",

This proposal has been submitted for consideration to the IEEE 802.3 HSSG (High Speed Study Group), but at this writing, no final decision has been made. This article also introduces a novel inverse-multiplexing scheme based on virtual lanes, which allows the PCS to support a wide variety of optical interface technologies (ranging from parallel to serial) and to accommodate advances in electrical signaling technologies (allowing the PCS electrical interface to get narrower and faster over time). The proposed solution applies equally to both 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s, but for simplicity this article focuses on the PCS layer and the novel requirements of the 100- Gb/s Ethernet.",

   "abstract": "Ethernet networks operating at (100+100) Gb/s per link are showing enough technical and market viability that intense development on technical specifications and component technologies is under way. However, the route to 100 Gb/s Ethernet products is still not completely clear because the market and applications for 100 Gb/s links are quite different than for 1 Gb/s and even 10 Gb/s links. This article attempts to provide a roadmap for adoption of 100 Gb/s Ethernet in enterprise data centers, outlining the features that will affect the schedule, as well as the capabilities of Ethernet gear as it is developed. The major opportunities for 100 Gb/s Ethernet appear to be primarily oriented toward server, rather than desktop/client, applications, and toward interconnecting various types of high- performance computing gear for technical and business analytic computing, as well as for media-oriented and web applications in content development and delivery. These applications will place requirements on the timeline and technical definition of networking gear operating at 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s.",

The proposed broadcasting scheme is appropriate for location-based push services and requires only a minor functional addition to the existing edge routers, base stations, or access points. To eliminate unnecessary broadcasting traffic, an efficient terminal-originated triggering algorithm for broadcast initiation is introduced. The scheme provides location-based information to mobile users without the need for protocol reconfigurations or prior knowledge of a user's location. We also discuss some potential applications of the scheme. Performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated and selected results are presented in this article. The evaluation shows that the broadcasting scheme significantly reduces the network traffic and the server load.",

Since 2001 WiMAX has evolved from 802.16 to 802.16d for fixed wireless access, and to the new IEEE 802.16e standard with mobility support. In this article we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art mobile WiMAX technology and its development. We focus our discussion on QoS provisioning and mobile WiMAX specification.",

Telecommunications over the past few years has been in a state of constant flux, with shifts in regulations, increased competition, and technological progress. The article describes these forces in detail and shows that the need for successful adoption of SOA within telecommunication has become a major agenda item for the majority of telecommunication network operators. The article then proceeds to describe SOA and its key enablers in telecommunications - Web services, event-driven architectures, Parlay X/ECMA specifications, and the enterprise service bus.",

   "abstract": "Web service composition is a mechanism for creating new web services from existing Web services. Web service composition enables rapid service creation by reusing existing services. Dynamic composition is composition at runtime. A business model defines the different parties involved in service provisioning and their relationships. However, the existing business models are not suitable for Web service composition. This article proposes a novel business model for dynamic web service composition that is an extension of the standard web service business model. The proposed model is demand-driven, where services can be dynamically composed based on the demand for them. We introduce new business roles and new interactions. We have provided a UDDI-based implementation of our new model by proposing extensions to the subscription API of UDDI. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and have made some preliminary performance measurements. The performance analysis shows that the UDDI extensions incur acceptable performance penalization.",

The architecture we describe has been realized by exploiting existing achievements in the field of conferencing. More precisely, starting from the IETF centralized conferencing (XCON) framework and based on an open source XCON implementation provided by our research group, we devised a distributed conferencing solution that was implemented as an overlay network of centralized conferencing clouds. The article's goal is to provide the reader with useful information about our experience with IMS implementation and deployment. We first describe our architecture from a high level design perspective and subsequently analyze it in detail by highlighting the most notable implementation choices",

   "abstract": "Spread spectrum communication - often called code-division multiple access - has been widely adopted over the years for many types of interference-challenged wireless communication systems including cellular and cordless telephones, wireless LANs and PANs, military applications, and global positioning systems. In this article we explore whether CDMA, in either its frequency hopping (FH) or direct sequence (DS) form, is an appropriate design approach for wireless ad hoc, or mesh, networks. One goal of this article is to help provoke a debate by explaining the main advantages and disadvantages of CDMA in the context of ad hoc networks as exposed by recent research. We argue that CDMA does not inherently improve the spectral efficiency of ad hoc networks; on the contrary, its valued interference averaging effect is not appreciable in ad hoc networks due to the irregular distribution of both the transmitters and receivers. On the positive side, both types (FH and DS) of spread spectrum allow for longer hop distances and a reversal of the usual relationship where the desired transmitter must be closer to the receiver than interfering transmitters. These two facts allow for significant advantages over narrowband systems in terms of energy efficiency and end-to-end delay.",

   "abstract": "Supporting streaming media applications over current packet network infrastructures represents a challenging task in many regards. For one, the lack of quality of service (QoS) guarantees in existing networks such as the Internet means that time-constrained media packets will face dynamic variations in bandwidth, loss rate, and delay as they traverse the network from the sender to the receiver. The variable rate of media traffic represents yet another difficulty when transmission constraints need to be met. Finally, the heterogeneity of client devices and access bandwidth coupled with custom user preferences exacerbate the problem of smooth and quality-optimized media playback even further. In this article we provide an overview of the various techniques for media and streaming strategy adaptation, which can be employed to deal with the difficulties imposed by such dynamic environments. These techniques depend on the characteristics of the media application, in particular on the network streaming infrastructure and the timing constraints imposed on the media packets' delivery. We survey adaptation techniques that act on the encoding of the multimedia information, on the scheduling of the media packets, or that try to combat transmission errors. We also briefly overview some media-friendly networking solutions, which contribute to increased QoS by incorporating some level of intelligence in intermediate network nodes. Finally, we describe a few open challenges in media streaming, emphasizing strategies based on promising cross-layer approaches where adaptation strategies are applied in a coordinated manner, across different layers of the network protocol stack",

Within service management, admission control has been recognized as a convenient mechanism to keep services under controlled load and ensure the required QoS levels, bringing consistency to the services offered. In this context, this article discusses the role of AC in multiservice IP networks, and surveys current and representative AC approaches. We address and compare the architectural principles of these AC approaches and their main features, virtues, and limitations that have an impact on the quality control of network services.

   "abstract": "The IMS conference control interfaces are still in an early stage of development, allowing only the creation of basic group communication services where the service definition and policy are either preconfigured or managed through proprietary mechanisms. The Web service abstraction for third-party service application development of those native interfaces, the OSA Parlay X multimedia conference Web service, inherits these limitations, therefore constraining the possibilities for advanced multipoint conferencing application deployment over the IMS platform. In order to address these deficiencies, the native IMS conference control interfaces need to be enhanced to provide a broader and finer-grained management environment, while maintaining high flexibility, scalability, and interoperability levels. This article describes the current IMS conferencing framework, at both the native and application-interfacing levels, analyzing its deficiencies and presenting how a deeper involvement of Web services would contribute to overcoming its limitations at both levels.",

   "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks have become a promising means to provide low-cost broadband access. Many WMN applications require broadcasting data (IPTV etc.) over the WMN. This article studies how efficient data broadcast, measured in terms of broadcast latency, can be realized by exploiting two features of WMNs: the use of multiple transmission rates at the link layer and the use of multiple radio interfaces on each node. We demonstrate that by exploiting these features, broadcast latency can be reduced severalfold compared to the current default practice in wireless LANs of using the lowest transmission rate for broadcast traffic. We also discuss two important insights we have gained from our investigation. First, we find that when multiple radio interfaces are used, a channel assignment algorithm designed for unicast traffic may often perform poorly for broadcast flows. Second, we find that the efficiency of a transmission rate for reducing broadcast latency can be reasonably predicted by the product of the transmission rate and its coverage area.",

   "abstract": "We developed hardware and software to perform exposure studies of the effects of certain RF electromagnetic fields on solid and liquid pharmaceuticals and biologies. The RF fields generated by our systems are similar to those emitted by RFID readers operating in the U.S. licensed HF and UHF bands. Our systems can expose drug samples (pharmaceuticals and biologies) to uniform electric (E) and/or magnetic (H) fields at levels that are much higher than those experienced by drugs near \"worst-case\" readers at a distance of 20 cm. Maximum field strengths near these readers were identified by measurements and computations of fields from commercial readers, and are extrapolated to the maximum allowable effective isotropic radiated power or field strength dictated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Exposures can be performed for each drug in both its retail primary package and in 54 mm diameter culture dishes. The containers are suitable for exposing a wide variety of formulations of. Exposures of drugs in culture dishes ensure uniform induced electric fields and currents. In contrast, exposures in the primary containers allow studies that account for the interactions of RF fields with the packaging materials and container geometry. In our UHF system we can expose drugs to over 20 W effective isotropic radiated power, over five times the FCC limits. We evaluated H fields emitted by commercially available RFID readers. In our HF system we can expose drugs to at least five times the H field they produce at 20 cm from the reader. We can expose samples to 5 A/m in primary packaging or in special organ culture dishes with an outer concentric ring. The ring has inner and outer diameters of 32 mm and 55 mm, respectively. Computer monitoring of power, drug temperature, and air temperature can be performed continuously during exposure. Surrounding air temperature is monitored at all times while in our laboratory and while shipped to drug laboratories for analysis.",

   "abstract": "Cellular networks have been widely used to support many new audio-and video-based multimedia applications. The demand for higher data rate and diverse services has driven the research on multihop cellular networks (MCNs). With its ad hoc network features, an MCN can offer many additional advantages, such as increased network throughput, scalability and coverage. However, providing ad hoc capability to MCNs is challenging as it may require proper wireless interfaces. In this article, the architecture of IEEE 802.16 network interface to provide ad hoc capability for MCNs is investigated, with its focus on the IEEE 802.16 mesh networking and scheduling. Several distributed routing algorithms based on network entry mechanism are studied and compared with a centralized routing algorithm. It is observed from the simulation results that 802.16 mesh networks have limitations on providing sufficient bandwidth for the traffic from the cellular base stations when a cellular network size is relatively large.",

   "abstract": "The IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) has been recognized as a reference next-generation network architecture for offering multimedia services over an Internet Protocol (IP)-based infrastructure. One of the key benefits of the IMS is efficient and flexible introduction of new services and access to third-party application providers, thanks to standard interfaces and standardized service capabilities. To support novel media-rich applications across a wide range of user devices and access networks, IMS must support negotiable quality of service (QoS) for IP multimedia sessions. In this article, we describe the application-level QoS signaling as specified by the 3GPP and propose some enhancements based on advanced QoS parameter matching and optimization functionality to be included along the signaling path. We outline various signaling flow scenarios and discuss them in the context of a case study involving an IMS-supported 3D virtual environment, featuring a treasure-hunt-like game.",

   "abstract": "Error-resilient video coding plays an important role in video transmission over error-prone networks. Intra coding, which can suppress error propagation very well in a simple way, is often employed in error-resilient video coding in some special ways and named as intra refresh. However, most of the existing intra refresh methods do not make good use of subjective human vision property. In this article a novel intra refresh method is presented, taking the fact that people usually intend to pay much more attention to a certain particular area in a video frame (attention area) than to other areas (nonattention area) in the same frame. In this method, blocks in the attention area of each video frame have a higher priority to be refreshed as intra mode than the blocks outside the attention area. Meanwhile, an attention-based end-to-end rate distortion model with reference restriction for both inter coding and intra coding is developed to obtain a better subjective quality. Experimental results in H.264/AVC-based video coding demonstrate that, when compared at the same bit rate and the same packet loss condition, the proposed method can provide a much better subjective feeling than existing intra refresh methods",

This paper focused on making RFID more applicable in our everyday lives, individuals such as these are converging at the two dozen or so RFID Centers of Excellence that have sprouted up around world over the last two to three years. They have come in the wake of Wal-Mart and Department of Defense mandates that their suppliers use RFID technology. Unlike RFID labs, which are often run by equipment manufacturers themselves, Centers of Excellence-and there are a host of them specializing in different fields around the United States-are based in universities and staffed by faculty and students.",

   "abstract": "Applications leveraging network presence in next-generation cellular networks have so far focused on subscription queries, where \"presence\" information is extracted from specific devices and sent to entities who have subscribed to such presence information. In this article we present BusinessFinder, a service that leverages the underlying cellular presence substrate to provide efficient, on-demand, context-aware matching of customer requests to nomadic micro businesses as well as small and medium businesses having a mobile workforce. Presence, in the context of BusinessFinder, is not simply limited to phone location and device status, but also encompasses dynamic attributes of vendors (both \"mobile\" and \"static\"), such as their current availability and workload, expertise and reputation. Besides presenting the architecture and implementation of BusinessFinder with a centralized source of context, we also describe early work on a novel resource-aware query routing algorithm that can efficiently support BusinessFinder query semantics in distributed presence environments of the future",

   "abstract": "The layer 1 virtual private network framework has emerged from the need to enable the dynamic coexistence of multiple circuit-switched client networks over a common physical network infrastructure. Such a VPN could be set up for an enterprise with offices across a wide geographical area (e.g., around the world or by a global ISP). Additionally, emerging IP over optical WDM technologies let IP traffic be carried directly over the optical WDM layer. Thus, different VPNs can share a common optical WDM core, and may demand different amounts of bandwidth at different time periods. This type of operation would require dynamic and reconfigurable allocation of bandwidth. This article evaluates the state of the art in layer 1 VPNs in the context of globally deployable optical networks and cost-efficient dynamic bandwidth usage. While exploiting the dynamism of IP traffic in a global network in which the nodes are located in different time zones, we study different bandwidth allocation methods for setting up a worldwide layer 1 VPN. We propose and investigate the characteristics of a cost-efficient bandwidth provisioning and reconfiguration algorithm, called capacity allocation using time zones (CATZ)",

   "abstract": "One of the key challenges of the emerging cognitive radio-based IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRANs) is to address two apparently conflicting requirements: ensuring QoS satisfaction for WRAN services while providing reliable spectrum sensing for guaranteeing licensed user protection. To perform reliable sensing, in the basic operation mode on a single frequency band (non-hopping mode), one must allocate quiet times, that is, periodically interrupt data transmission that could impair the QoS of WRAN. This critical issue can be addressed by an alternative operation mode proposed in 802.22 called dynamic frequency hopping (DFH), where WRAN data transmission is performed in parallel with spectrum sensing without interruptions. DFH community, as described in this article, is a mechanism that coordinates multiple WRAN cells operating in the DFH mode, such that efficient frequency usage and reliable channel sensing are achieved. The key idea of DFH community is that neighboring WRAN cells form cooperating communities that coordinate their DFH operations",

In short, it aims at reusing sparsely occupied frequency bands while causing no (or insignificant) interference to the actual licensees. This article focuses on applying this concept in the time domain by exploiting idle periods between bursty transmissions of multi-access communication channels and addresses WLAN as an example of practical importance. A statistical model based on empirical data is presented, and it is shown how to use this model for deriving access strategies. The coexistence of Bluetooth and WLAN is considered as a concrete example",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radios are promising solutions to the problem of overcrowded spectrum. In this article we explore the throughput potential of cognitive communication. Different interpretations of cognitive radio that underlay, overlay, and interweave the transmissions of the cognitive user with those of licensed users are described. Considering opportunistic communication as a baseline, we investigate the throughput improvements offered by the overlay methods. Channel selection techniques for opportunistic access such as frequency hopping, frequency tracking, and frequency coding are presented. The trade-off between regulation and autonomy inherent in the design and performance of cognitive networks is examined through a simple example, which shows that the optimal amount of licensing is equal to the duty cycle of the traffic arrivals",

   "abstract": "Digital circuits implemented in CMOS technology have been the workhorses of high performance computer processors for more than a decade, following Moore's law with exponentially increasing integration and performance. Driven by lower cost, increasing performance, and mixed-signal benefits, CMOS technology also has found increasing use in analog, and more recently, RF applications. Now, with transistor performance still improving, wires are becoming the limiting factor for speed and performance by imposing limits on communication bandwidth and latency between processing cores and memories, both off- and on-chip. Communication and circuit techniques, developed mainly for narrow band-wireless RF communication can help increase the wired communication speed in digital systems. This approach, dubbed RF Interconnect (RF-I), picks up speed for on-board and on-chip applications, changing the communication paradigm from the old parallel unidirectional time-shared bus to new transmission lines enabling reconfigurable communication using both frequency and code division multiple access techniques.",

   "abstract": "Next-generation wireless mobile communications will be driven by converged networks that integrate disparate technologies and services. The wireless mesh network is envisaged to be one of the key components in the converged networks of the future, providing flexible high- bandwidth wireless backhaul over large geographical areas. While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple nonoverlap- ping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, the assignment of channels to the radio interfaces poses significant challenges. The goal of channel assignment algorithms in multiradio mesh networks is to minimize interference while improving the aggregate network capacity and maintaining the connectivity of the network. In this article we examine the unique constraints of channel assignment in wireless mesh networks and identify the key factors governing assignment schemes, with particular reference to interference, traffic patterns, and multipath connectivity. After presenting a taxonomy of existing channel assignment algorithms for WMNs, we describe a new channel assignment scheme called MesTiC, which incorporates the mesh traffic pattern together with connectivity issues in order to minimize interference in multi- radio mesh networks.",

   "abstract": "Dynamic access of unused spectrum via a cognitive radio asks for flexible radio circuits that can work at an arbitrary radio frequency. This article reviews techniques to realize radios without resorting to frequency selective dedicated filters. In particular, a recently proposed polyphase multipath technique canceling harmonics and sidebands is discussed. Using this technique, a wideband and flexible power upconverter with a clean output spectrum has been realized on a CMOS chip, aiming at flexible radio transmitter application. Prototype chips can transmit at an arbitrary frequency between DC and 2.4 GHz. Unwanted harmonics and sidebands are more than 40 dB lower than the desired signal up to the 17th harmonic of the transmit frequency",

   "abstract": "This article discusses common sense for obtaining patents in litigation. Since the teaching, suggestion, or motivation (TSM) would allow one to argue that a combination was improper. A strict reading of the TSM test could make allowable a claim that would rely on elements which in the course of business would have been combined by a person in the field. The test was used by patent attorneys in obtaining patents over rejections. A defendant might raise the argument that a patent is invalid because the patent should never have been issued, since the claims are obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The patent holder could rely on TSM to prevail against a defendant.",

   "abstract": "This article shows how service mediation can be used to add security features to services in a mobile service platform. This base platform takes care of security, charging, and other basic functions, which are then configured for services at runtime using a pluggable mediator framework. Service providers can focus on content, and thus leverage the signaling and mediation capabilities of the core platform. Mediators add specific functionality to a service, and are a specific form of service composition and selection. We examine how security technologies for authentication and authorization are integrated by mediators into a single policy infrastructure with a homogeneous interface for services. We consider here the Web services SAML and the 3GPP GBA security bootstrapping standard in the context of mobile services. We give an example using a video on demand service, and discuss how and when security concerns of services can be transferred from the services to mediators.",

   "abstract": "The digital divide is a pressing challenge for both technology and policy professionals. Connectivity is one aspect of the divide, albeit an important one. Availability and affordability remain important issues, but these depend on not only technology choices, but also business and regulatory models. While mobile phones have achieved spectacular growth in emerging regions, Internet access, especially broadband, lags far behind. A generalized model of costing broadband indicates that limited uplinking (interconnection) is a significant barrier to widespread and affordable connectivity, but last mile access also remains a challenge. In addition, policy distortions and regulations raise costs dramatically. Because of these, new technologies, business models, and regulations may be required to make connectivity available and affordable in emerging economies. These include advanced wireless technologies, greater fiber utilization, and open access networking",

   "abstract": "Covert channels are used for the secret transfer of information. Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorized parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication. Initially, covert channels were identified as a security threat on monolithic systems such as mainframes. More recently, focus has shifted toward covert channels in computer network protocols. The huge amount of data and large number of different protocols in the Internet is ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This article provides an overview of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network protocols, and common methods for their detection, elimination, and capacity limitation.",

   "abstract": "In this article we propose a cross-layer design model for multimedia multicast/broadcast services to efficiently support the diverse quality of service requirements over mobile wireless networks. Specifically, we aim at achieving high system throughput for multimedia multicast/broadcast while satisfying QoS requirements from different protocol layers. First, at the physical layer, we propose a dynamic rate adaptation scheme to optimize the average throughput subject to the loss rate QoS constraint specified from the upper-layer protocol users. We investigate scenarios with either independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) or non-i.i.d. fading channels connecting to different multicast receivers. Then, applying the effective capacity theory at the data link layer, we study the impact of the delay QoS requirement (i.e., QoS exponent) on the multimedia data rate of mobile multicast/broadcast that our proposed scheme can support. Also presented are simulation results which show the trade-off among different QoS metrics and the performance superiority of our proposed scheme as compared to the other existing schemes.",

A new \"Copper-PON\" or, more compactly CuPON<sup>1</sup> multidropping DSL architecture enables DSL bandwidth sharing and increases data rates through exploitation of all modes of crosstalk, particularly with the use of vectored<sup>2</sup> dynamic spectrum management. The inevitable emerging conclusion raises an intriguing question about the broadband access evolution of telecommunications networks: Why deploy currently available or contemplated passive fiber systems when the existing last kilometer of copper can provide broadband gigabits per second to everyone?",

However, most of these systems are commercial and proprietary, and hence little research was done in the area of characterizing practical system performance properties. In this article, we mainly present our experience on a practical P2P-based live video- streaming system called GridMedia, which was employed to broadcast live the Chinese Spring Festival Gala show over the Internet. Benefiting from two sets of flush-crowd traces with about 15,239 and 224,453 concurrent users in a 300 kb/s streaming session in 2005 and 2006, we perform a trace study to understand the service capacity, quality of streaming service, connection heterogeneity, user geographic distribution, and request and online duration characteristics. Our observations shed light on those systems and further improvements in the arena of large-scale live video-streaming service over the Internet.",

   "abstract": "Mobile video services have generated a lot of interest recently. To reach a cost-effective solution, design trade-offs among system performance, hardware complexity, and power consumption must be considered in the early design phase of such applications. In this article, we present a system overview, simulation platform, and hardware design of a DVB-T/H baseband receiver. Starting with a design platform, several algorithms on both inner and outer receivers are developed to meet target system performance under different channels. Then, system architecture and related key modules are explored, taking into account both silicon area and power consumption. Finally, several design issues related to the integration of the proposed DVB-T/H inner and outer receivers are addressed.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radios have been advanced as a technology for the opportunistic use of underutilized spectrum wherein secondary devices sense the presence of the primary user and use the spectrum only if it is deemed empty. Spectral cognition of this form can also be used by regulators to facilitate the dynamic coexistence of different service types. An example of this is the operation of ultra-wideband devices in WiMAX bands: UWB devices must detect and avoid WiMAX devices in certain regulatory domains. In this article we start by discussing various options for detection and avoidance. We then describe the obstacles faced in achieving robust detection and avoidance with an on-chip implementation of basic DAA functionality. Finally, we present measurement results for operation of a single UWB device with a WiMAX system. This interaction also highlights the problem of dealing with listen before speak primaries where secondary transmission could interfere by blocking the primary's access to the medium.",

   "abstract": "Free-space optical communications is an emerging solution to increase link capacity of nondetectable links to multi gigabits per second. FSO is widely believed as to overcome radio frequency spectrum and data rate limitations. However, one of the biggest challenges facing FSO deployment is its optical signal propagation in different atmospheric conditions. This effect causes variable link degradation due to variable attenuation and fading. Atmospheric turbulence produces temporary pockets of air with slightly different indices of refraction. Therefore the laser beam phase-front varies randomly, producing intensity fluctuation. One further key challenge with FSO systems is maintaining transceiver alignment. Using highly directional and narrow beams of light, variable mispointing of the transmit beam, and tracking errors of the receiver will generate additional signal fading. In this article terminal design aspects are discussed, and problems that occur when building FSO terminals are highlighted.",

In addition to fostering the development of novel media applications, P2P systems also represent an interesting alternative paradigm for media streaming applications that can benefit from the inherent self organization and resource scalability available in such environments. This article presents an overview of application and network layer mechanisms that enable successful streaming frameworks in peer-to-peer systems. We describe media delivery architectures that can be deployed over P2P networks to address the specific requirements of streaming applications. In particular, we show how video-streaming applications can benefit from the diversity offered by P2P systems and implement distributed-streaming and scheduling solutions with multi-path packet transmission.",

   "abstract": "A review of the guiding principles of the IEEE 802 architecture is presented followed by the origin and goals of the ITU-T functional architecture. The applicability of these architectures to Ethernet bridging standards is shown, specifically, how these architectures enabled 802.1Q to evolve from the enterprise to the carrier. Further, the application of ITU-T modeling to Ethernet bridging enabled simplified management for operators but also has exposed the limitations of using only a connection-oriented model.",

   "abstract": "Although the session initiation protocol (SIP) based IMS network has attained attention for IP voice and video telephony networks, the popular and prevalent Web and streaming video applications are supported by real time streaming protocol (RTSP) and HTTP proxy networks. The current trend of maintaining disparate SIP-based IMS, RTSP, and HTTP proxy networks introduce added cost due to the duplication of network components, separate maintenance functions, and scaling inefficiency. Service providers' requirements to reduce such costs, call for the development of a solution that integrates the three proxy networks into a single hybrid platform. This article depicts the vision of such a hybrid platform, exemplified by two blended prototypes - shared streaming video application and the multimedia proxy. It is through the development of such applications that a path to an enhanced or extended IMS architecture encompassing the three proxy networks is possible. This article describes approaches promising the synthesis of IMS, HTTP, and RTSP based networks into integrated platforms that pioneer convergence to the vision. This article investigates a future, possible expansion of IMS to harmonize SIP, HTTP, and RTSP service delivery. The objective of this article is to initiate discussion and research",

   "abstract": "The convergence of wireless radio networks with all-IP networks has gained significant attention due to the ever increasing proliferation of IP technologies toward base stations as well as advances in air interfaces and wireless multimedia applications. Within standardization bodies, significant efforts are underway to address the support of QoS within the radio access network and Internet multimedia subsystem. For successful end-to-end application delivery, QoS and user profile unification are critical challenges, as is the intertwined policy enforcement between the IMS and the radio network. In this article we present a comprehensive analysis of QoS signaling over the integrated RAN and IMS domains. By using an imaginary service example, referred to as family media service, we analyze the specifics of end-to-end QoS invocation, control, and policy enforcement, including roaming scenarios. Based on laboratory measurements and simulations, we assess the call-setup delay, and recommend RAN and IMS signaling optimizations for delay reduction. We conclude the article by outlining open issues and proposing viable solutions.",

   "abstract": "EPON and WiMAX are two promising broadband access technologies for new-generation wired and wireless access. Their complementary features motivate interest in using EPON as a backhaul to connect multiple dispersed WiMAX base stations. In this article we propose four broadband access architectures to integrate EPON and WiMAX technologies. The integrated architectures can take advantage of the bandwidth benefit of fiber communications, and the mobile and non-line-of-sight features of wireless communications. Based on these integrated architectures, we elaborate on related control and operation issues to address the benefits gained by this integration. Integration of EPON and WiMAX enables fixed mobile convergence, and is expected to significantly reduce overall design and operational costs for new-generation broadband access networks.",

   "abstract": "High-speed packet access (HSPA) was included in third generation partnership project (3GPP) releases 5 and 6 for downlink and for uplink. The 3GPP release 7 offers a number of HSPA enhancements, providing major improvements to the end-user performance and to network efficiency. The release 7 features are introduced in this paper. Release 7 also is known as HSPA evolution or HSPA+. The HSPA+ downlink peak bit rate can be increased to 28.8 Mbps with a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna solution, and the uplink rate can be increased to 11.5 Mbps with higher order modulation in release 7. The higher peak rates are facilitated by the layer 2 optimization in downlink. In addition, the terminal power consumption can be reduced considerably for packet applications. The downlink cell capacity will be enhanced with new types of terminal requirements for a two-antenna equalizer and with MIMO. Altogether, release 7 features nearly double the cell capacity compared to release 6 with emphasis on the capacity of voice-over-IP (VoIP) service. 3GPP release 7 enables the simplification of the network architecture. The number of network elements for the user plane can be reduced from four in release 6 to two in release 7. The HSPA flat architecture in release 7 is similar to the architecture agreed upon for 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE), thus enabling the later, smooth evolution from HSPA to LTE. LTE will be specified as part of release 8 and further push the radio capabilities higher with larger bandwidth and lower latency. The LTE performance target is to provide two-to-four times the performance of the HSPA release 6 reference case [1]. 3GPP release 7 and 8 solutions for the HSPA evolution will be worked in parallel together with the LTE development, and some aspects of the LTE work are expected to reflect on the HSPA evolution as well. 3GPP release 7 was completed in June 2007, with some work remaining on the performance requirements. Commercial deployment and devices are expected by 2009.",

   "abstract": "Ethernet is increasingly being used in carrier networks to transport real-time traffic, including wireless backhaul network traffic, time-sensitive audio/video applications in access networks, and circuit emulation for legacy services. With the replacement of traditional circuit-switched networks with Ethernet-based packet networks, it must be ensured that the application timing and QoS requirements are met. The IEEE 802.1 Audio/Video Bridging Task Group is developing a comprehensive set of standards to enable high quality, low-latency streaming of time-sensitive applications. These standards specify a means of providing time synchronization (IEEE 802.IAS), a resource reservation protocol (IEEE 802.1Qat), and a set of forwarding and queuing rules that bound the variability of delay in an AVB network (IEEE 802.1Qav). These standards are described, including their potential application to carrier-grade Ethernet networks.",

   "abstract": "IP over optical network architectures have been extensively discussed within the research literature over the past few years. However, although signaling protocols between IP routers and optical cross-connect networks have been standardized, large IP backbones are not typically deployed over optical cross-connect networks with automatic reconfigurability features, such as automatic restoration or dynamic establishment of new IP links. One of the most important criteria in determining whether an IP backbone should be carried over such an optical cross-connect network is economic viability. In this article we analyze and explore four architectures for a typical large ISP backbone. In contrast with some other published claims, our results suggest it is more economically attractive to bypass an intermediate cross-connect network, given current equipment and IP backbone network design requirements. However, for ISPs who also provide a large volume of private line services, we propose an integrated architecture for IP over optical cross-connect networks that may provide an attractive alternative for providing rapid and cost-effective restoration from network failures",

   "abstract": "The advances in broadband Internet access and scalable video technologies have made it possible for Internet Protocol television (IPTV) to become the next killer application for modern Internet carriers in metropolitan areas. With the recent release of IEEE 802.16d/e (worldwide interoperability for microwave access or WiMAX), broadband wireless access (BWA) is envisioned to further extend IPTV services to a new application scenario with wireless and mobility dimensions. It is a very strategic but challenging leverage for a carrier to glimpse the potential of IPTV by using WiMAX as the access network. Challenges are posed for IPTV over WiMAX due to multicasting under a diversity of fading conditions. A cross-layer design framework based on a novel two-level superposition coded multicasting (SCM) scheme is introduced. Simulation results show that much improved video quality is achievable with our approach.",

   "abstract": "Within Mobile VCE, a team of several leading U.K. universities, in dose association with major manufacturers and international telecom operators from the mobile industry, have been addressing the challenging task of designing transceiver structures for beyond 3G networks. Innovative approaches led to a plethora of cross-layer optimized technologies of low complexity and high robustness, allowing for the much promised multimedia-centric services over future wireless networks. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the research conducted within Mobile VCE's Core Wireless Access Research Programme, a key focus of which has naturally been on MIMO transceivers. The series of articles offers a coherent view of how the work was structured and comprises a compilation of material that has been presented in detail elsewhere (see references within the article). In this article, the first of four, MIMO channel measurements, analysis, and modeling are presented, which were then utilized to develop compact and distributed antenna arrays. Parallel activities led to research into low-complexity MIMO single-user space-time coding techniques, as well as SISO and MIMO multi-user CDMA-based transceivers for B3G systems. As well as feeding into the industry's in-house research program, significant extensions of this work are now in hand, within Mobile VCE's own core activity, aimed at securing major improvements in delivery efficiency in future wireless systems through cross-layer operation",

   "abstract": "In this article we present various issues that need careful design for the successful implementation of OFDMA-based multihop cellular networks which need incorporation of relay terminals. The first issue we present is synchronization. We show that it is not a problematic issue for infrastructure-based relaying, where the relay is deployed by a system operator at strategic points in the cell. Second, we focus on the advantage of adaptive relaying and provide a frame structure to enable adaptive relaying in a cellular network operating according to the IEEE 802.16e standard. The third issue we present is related to hardware implementation aspects. Hardware performance and resource usage analysis will show that cooperative diversity schemes increase hardware resource usage and power/energy consumption at mobile terminals. The last issue we present is within the context of link layer ARQ, where we propose a novel retransmission method, named local retransmission-ARQ (LR-ARQ), which is designed to take advantage of the multihop nature of the cellular network. Practically, we show that LR-ARQ improves performance with respect to its single-hop counterpart in terms of cell latency, goodput, and throughput.",

The centralized piconet coordinator (PNC) needs to be dynamically selected depending on a number of categories that measure its abilities as the most capable device compared to the surrounding devices in the network. This article presents an extension to the PNC selection criteria in IEEE 802.15.3 by modifying the reserved fields readily available in the standard to support user-centricity as well as other higher layer service dependent criteria. This article also develops the implementation process for the message header exchange between devices to support this new selection process. In addition, simulations are carried out that show the proof of concept of the manner in which this new criteria could be implemented in IEEE 802.15.3.",

In this context this article elaborates on a methodology developed within the Project 1ST NOBEL, for integrating cost functions and other design constraints into the planning of a DWDM network while considering this evolution perspective to a transparent optical network. This systematic approach builds upon the experience of static network design and is substantiated by specific examples in this article",

   "abstract": "For label switched networks, such as MPLS and GMPLS, most existing traffic engineering solutions work in a single routing domain. These solutions do not work when a route from the ingress node to the egress node leaves the routing area or autonomous system of the ingress node. In such cases, the path computation problem becomes complicated because of the unavailability of the complete routing information throughout the network. This is because service providers usually choose not to leak routing information beyond the routing area or AS for scalability constraints and confidentiality concerns. This article serves two purposes. First, it provides a description of the existing and ongoing work in interdomain TE within the IETF. This information is currently found in various Internet drafts and has not yet been collectively presented in a single document. To this end, a summary of both existing path computation architectures - PCE-based and per-domain - is provided. Second, it compares two per-domain path computation schemes in terms of the total number of LSPs successfully placed and average number of domains crossed, without assuming availability of complete topology information. We notice that the two per-domain path computation schemes, proposed in [1, 2], have comparable path computation complexities and setup latencies.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an approach to delivering qualitative end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees across the multiprovider Internet. We propose that bilateral agreements between a number of autonomous systems (ASs) result in the establishment of QoS-class planes that potentially extend across the global Internet. The deployment of a QoS-enhanced border gateway protocol (BGP) with different QoS-based route selection policies in each of the planes allows a range of interdomain QoS capabilities to coexist on the same network infrastructure. The article presents simulation results showing the benefits of the approach and discusses aspects of the performance of QoS-enhanced BGP",

Interworking at the service layer between 3GPP and Wimax networks requires interworking between IMS functionality. By studying several interconnection scenarios and the main functionality of IMS, this article analyzes how the interworking of 3GPP and Wimax networks can be performed to support different levels of service interconnection. Special attention is paid to the interconnection at the session negotiation level, using SIP (the base protocol of the IMS), COPS/Go, and diameter protocols/interface to provide session negotiation with QoS and AAA (authentication authorization accounting) support",

   "abstract": "Although network management has always played a key role for industry, it only recently received a similar level of attention from many research communities, accelerated by funding opportunities from new initiatives, including the FP7 Program in Europe and GENI/FIND in the United States. Work is ongoing to assess the state of the art and identify the challenges for future research in the field, and this article contributes to this discussion. It presents major findings from a two-day workshop organized jointly by the IRTF/NMRG and the EMANICS Network of Excellence, at which researchers, operators, vendors, and technology developers discussed the research directions to be pursued over the next five years. The workshop identified several topic areas, including management architectures, distributed real-time monitoring, data analysis and visualization, ontologies, economic aspects of management, uncertainty and probabilistic approaches, as well as understanding the behavior of managed systems.",

Rapid advances in next-generation SONET/SPH and optical switching along with GMPLS control have enabled many new services' provisioning capabilities. In particular, a key paradigm is the new layer 1 virtual private network framework, which allows clients to directly provision their own services without deploying expensive infrastructures. This article presents an overview of L1-VPN and describes a resource management scheme that will enable transport network virtualization across a multidomain network infrastructure. The scheme is implemented in both centralized and distributed control frameworks, and allows for dynamic sharing of transport resources. A case study of performance analysis results is presented showing a distributed control plane in a multidomain network architecture achieving higher VPN carrying capacity than a centralized control plane",

   "abstract": "Layer 3 virtual private networks (L3VFN) enable organizations to connect geographically dispersed sites to one another across the packet switched network of a service provider. The most popular form of L3VPN is based on BGP/MPLS (border gateway protocol/multiprotocol label switching) technology in which the service provider offers a network-based IP VPN routing and forwarding service to its customers across its own IPv4-based MPLS backbone network. With the deployment of IPv6-based backbone networks underway, there is an emerging requirement to support these same L3VPN services across a native IPv6 backbone network. This introduces a requirement to provide routing and tunneling of IPv6 VPN (and IPv4 VPN) packets across an IPv6 backbone network. Softwires is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Working Group chartered to address the requirement of providing a generalized, network-based, multi-address family, IP routing and tunneling capability across native IP backbone networks pursuant to IPv6 transitions. Elements of the softwires work can form the basis of an L3VPN over IPv6 solution. After providing a brief overview of how L3VPN works in various topologies, this article presents the requirements for L3VPN services over an IPv6 backbone network and discusses a possible solution set that builds over the softwire technology and related IETF standards. Finally, we outline future directions and how the softwire technology can support new services and improved scalability",

   "abstract": "The application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to patient care in hospitals and healthcare facilities has only just begun to be accepted. This article develops a set of frameworks based on patient life cycle and time-and-motion perspectives for how RFID can be leveraged atop existing information systems to offer many benefits for patient care and hospital operations. It examines how patients are processed from admission to discharge, and considers where RFID can be applied. From a time-and-motion perspective, it shows how hospitals can apply RFID in three ways: fixed RFID readers interrogate mobile objects; mobile, handheld readers interrogate fixed objects; and mobile, handheld readers interrogate mobile objects. Implemented properly, RFID can significantly aid the medical staff in performing their duties. It can greatly reduce the need for manual entry of records, increase security for both patient and hospital, and reduce errors in administering medication. Hospitals are likely to encounter challenges, however, when integrating the technology into their day-to-day operations. What we present here can help hospital administrators determine where RFID can be deployed to add the most value.",

In this spirit, standardization undertaken by the DSL forum not only addresses remote management of the residential gateway but recently, also extends to in-house devices. We propose a solution that bridges remote management specified by CWMP with UPnP, already established inside the home environment. This approach will enable providers to remotely configure and manage in-house UPnP-enabled equipment, thus accelerating the deployment of new services. We investigate the nature of the two protocols and specify the bridging functionality, taking into consideration scalability and transparency. Experimental results support the applicability of the proposed approach, highlight the importance of message filtering, and provide general insight into the interplay intricacies of the particular protocol functions.",

FIFO scheduling in the current IEEE 802.11 MAC suffers from this problem when the network is highly loaded. The problem may keep the sender in backoff stage up to 70 percent of the time, leading to significant throughput degradation. One solution is to increase the RTS success rate by extending the RTS frame to multicast RTS so that multiple receivers can be checked simultaneously. We present an adaptive learning process that constructs the receiver list based on the dynamic channel-state diversity of candidate receivers.

   "abstract": "Growth of IP-based traffic in enterprise, LAN, server, core routing and carrier/WAN transport has not only led core router links to exceed 10 Gb/s but in many cases to approach 100 Gb/s. In response, the IEEE 802.3 Working Group initiated the development of new standards for high-speed Ethernet at 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s. This article provides an overview of the market drivers for 100-Gigabit Ethernet (100 GbE) in carrier and WAN applications, primarily driven by the need for greater trunk capacity to interconnect routers. The technology options for enabling WAN transport of 100 GbE over long-distance networks are described, along with standardization efforts and new technologies for cost-effective, reliable and managed transport. Finally, a pre-standard demonstration is presented of 100-Gb/s Ethernet transported over a 4000-km-long network.",

We evaluate their salient features and quantify their handoff latency. It is shown that the SIP-based network mobility support protocol can easily be deployed and reduce the tunneling overhead incurred in the NEMO basic support protocol. However, it increases handoff latency due to longer message length. We also discuss several open research issues for seamless mobility support in mobile hotspots.",

   "abstract": "Wireless service providers strive to preserve the quality of service and user experience for mobile users. Several standards bodies are defining architectures that can be used as a platform to provide secure and seamless services to these mobile users. These architectures aim to provide several required functions such as signaling, configuration, security association, encryption, and billing. However, the placement of several functional components and their interaction at several layers contributes to the operational complexity and thus affects the optimal results. Testbed realization of any standardized architecture can help investigate the underlying networking issues. In this article, we describe a mobility test bed implementation based on one of the architecture alternatives of 3GPP2, where the outbound signaling servers are distributed around the edges of the network. We experiment with three different hand-off techniques and analyze the associated experimental results. Analysis of these experimental results and experiences obtained from the testbed implementation can be helpful to any service provider that plans to deploy a version of the MMD (multimedia domain) architecture with distributed signaling servers.",

   "abstract": "There is a need for 100 Gb/s data transport, or 100 Gb Ethernet (100 GbE), for both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Standardization related to 100 Gb/s is a key next step for Ethernet to continue in its role as a ubiquitous end-to-end protocol. This article describes recent standardization efforts, and activities planned for the future. 100 Gb is a work in progress and this article provides an early snapshot of the standards effort being undertaken mostly by the IEEE 802.3 and its High Speed Study Group (HSSG), which recently approved a project authorization request (PAR) 802.3ba document. In addition, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) is involved in the definition of 100 GbE parameters for transport over the WAN by using the Optical Transport Network (OTN) rates standardized so far. It is critical that 100 GbE efforts progress in an orderly manner to ensure a robust and healthy overall network infrastructure.",

   "abstract": "Multimedia stream service provided by broadband wireless networks has emerged as an important technology and has attracted much attention. An all-IP network architecture with reliable high-throughput air interface makes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA)-based mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave access (mobile WiMAX) a viable technology for wireless multimedia services, such as voice over IP (VoIP), mobile TV, and so on. One of the main features in a WiMAX MAC layer is that it can provide'differentiated services among different traffic categories with individual QoS requirements. In this article, we first give an overview of the key aspects of WiMAX and describe multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) architecture of the 3GPP. Then, we propose a multicast and broadcast service (MBS) architecture for WiMAX that is based on MBMS. Moreover, we enhance the MBS architecture for mobile WiMAX to overcome the shortcoming of limited video broadcast performance over the baseline MBS model. We also give examples to demonstrate that the proposed architecture can support better mobility and offer higher power efficiency.",

   "abstract": "There exist two fundamental approaches to multicast routing: shortest path trees (SPTs) and minimum cost trees (MCTs). The SPT algorithms minimize the distance (or cost) from the sender to each receiver, whereas the MCT algorithms minimize the overall cost of the multicast tree. Due to the very large scale and unknown topology of the Internet, computing MCTs for multicast routing in the Internet is a very complex problem. As a result, the SPT approach is the more commonly used method for multicast routing in the Internet, because it is easy to implement and gives minimum delay from the sender to each receiver, a property favored by many real-life applications. Unlike the Internet, a wireless mesh network (WMN) has a much smaller size, and its topology can be made known to all nodes in the network. This makes the MCT approach an equally viable candidate for multicast routing in WMNs. However, it is not clear how the two types of trees compare when used in WMNs. In this article we present a simulation-based performance comparison of SPTs and MCTs in WMNs, using performance metrics, such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and traffic impacts on unicast flows in the same network.",

These proposals are based on a well-known technique: the aggregation of traffic into shared trees to manage the forwarding state vs. bandwidth saving trade-off. This sort of traffic engineering mechanism requires methods to estimate the resources needed to set up a multicast shared tree for a set of VPNs. The methodology proposed in this article consists of studying the effect of aggregation obtained by random shared tree allocation on a reference model of a representative network scenario.",

We summarize the main achievements and point out the limits of MANET research. This research was conducted under the assumption that the networks mainly will be used for large-scale general consumer applications, and nodes would be ubiquitous, thus reasonably dense and active. Both assumptions do not reflect reality and certainly would not be true in an initial phase of deployment. A lack of realism regarding the objective of MANET coupled with a lack of realism during the design of MANET are the main causes of MANET running a high risk of failure",

   "abstract": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in integrating multihop relaying functionalities into cellular wireless networks. Multihop cellular networks can potentially enhance coverage, data rates, QoS performance in terms of call blocking probability, bit error rate, as well as QoS fairness for different users. However, in-depth investigations and careful system designs are required to exploit these potential advantages. Specifically, routing and resource allocation algorithms should be designed such that the maximum performance gain can be achieved. A number of different architectures, protocols, and analytical models for MCNs have been proposed in the literature where different system aspects were investigated. This article aims to present an overview of existing work in this area, pointing out key research issues and their possible solutions. Also, we present a resource allocation framework for out-of- band relaying. The throughput enhancement due to the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical results.",

   "abstract": "Conventional block-based broadcast authentication protocols overlook the heterogeneity of receivers in mobile computing by letting the sender choose the block size, divide a broadcast stream into blocks, associate each block with a signature, and spread the effect of the signature across all the packets in the block through hash or coding algorithms. They suffer from some drawbacks. First, they require that the entire block with its signature be collected before authenticating every packet in the block. This authentication latency can lead to the jitter effect on real-time applications at receivers. Second, the block-based approach is vulnerable to packet loss in mobile computing in the sense that the loss of some packets makes the other packets unable to be authenticated, especially when the block signature is lost. Third, they are also vulnerable to DoS attacks caused by the injection of forged packets. In this article we propose a novel broadcast authentication protocol based on an efficient cryptographic primitive called a batch signature. Our protocol supports the verification of the authenticity of any number of packets simultaneously and avoids the shortcomings of the block-based approach.",

   "abstract": "The home gateway market is undergoing deep changes. On one side, home networks are evolving, getting dynamic and federating more and more devices. On the WAN side, new actors appear, such as multimedia content providers. From both sides emerge new features and new management needs. In this article we highlight challenges and benefits of moving more intelligence to the home gateway, making it more than a simple interconnection device. We argue that we need a full-fledged execution environment on gateways to address the evolution of business models. We present this evolution and summarize existing solutions for execution environments and management for home gateways. Then we propose two improvements that reflect the new requirements. The first improvement is a high-level virtualization of service gateways, and the second one recommends an end-to-end dynamic multiprovider management system.",

   "abstract": "The multihop cellular network architecture has been actively studied due to its capability to significantly increase cellular system capacity and coverage, and at the same time greatly reduce the transmission range of mobile nodes. The majority of the literature on MCN, however, is based on discussions from the physical or link layer point of view. In this article we look at the logical MCN architecture from the IP layer aspect. We believe that this aspect is critical to general deployment of Internet applications on the MCN because IP is the dominant supporting protocol for such applications. We introduce a new architecture based on the integration of nested network mobility (nested NEMO), which is a pure IP layer architecture, and MCN. We name the resulting architecture nested NEMO on MCN. We illustrate how nested NEMO on MCN operates and how it realizes the advantages provided by MCN on the IP layer. We also unveil a potential problem specific to the nested NEMO on MCN architecture: recursive IP fragmentation. A simple technique to overcome this problem is proposed.",

   "abstract": "An evolving wireless world is constantly providing users with a wider set of access technologies to choose from, each with different capabilities and properties. In this world, IMS as defined by 3GPP provides an enabling, standardized multimedia architecture that is access independent, hence, providing service convergence. This trend is accompanied by an increasing number of multimode terminals so that inter-access- system-service continuity gains relevance. This article presents the architectural framework of NetCAPE (networking context aware policy environment), which addresses the optimization of mobility management in such a heterogeneous environment while interacting with IMS applications to enable seamless service delivery across heterogeneous mobile networks; even as the mobility offered by the underlying network remains transparent to IMS applications. Although the focus is on 3GPP-based mobile networks, the framework also incorporates wired access technologies, hence, taking a further step toward fixed mobile convergence (FMC). First results are presented highlighting the improvements gained by applying NetCAPE concepts.",

   "abstract": "As 3G wireless networks evolve toward 4G, various wireless network technology organizations are considering a major redesign of the network architecture. We present a perspective on such a redesign motivated primarily by cost considerations. We examine some tenets for the design of 4G wireless network architectures that are aimed at improving costs in various aspects of the network. One tenet is the maximization of economies of scale by partitioning the functionality among network elements in a way that maximizes the potential domain of applicability of the network elements. Another is reduction of the number of distinct types of network elements needed by flattening the levels of hierarchy in the execution of various functions. We explain our reasoning by illustrating a way of redesigning the current 3GPP network architecture based on these tenets.",

At speeds between 1 and 4 GBaud the SFP form factor is by far the most commonly used. Up to now 10 GBaud transceivers have used larger devices with larger power dissipations. This article describes the SFP+ module being specified by the SFF Committee (SFF 8431) that will enable the same port densities as the SFP module. The adaptive equalizers and high-speed transmission channels required in the switches to make the SFP+ module work successfully are also described",

   "abstract": "For the past few years, the evolution of electro-optical technology has driven change in optical networks in the access and backbone areas. Optical bypassing and traffic aggregation mitigate the scalability problem in backbone networks, and burst mode transmission can provide a cost-efficient solution for access networks. Using those technologies, a new solution can be found for metro area networks, which interconnect access and backbone networks. In this article, we introduce a new solution for metro area networks, called optical burst transport (OBT). OBT is designed to use the promising technologies of backbone and access networks so that it provides all benefits, such as dynamic bandwidth provisioning, scalability, and robustness for unbalanced traffic. The performance evaluation of OBT also is verified by means of a testbed implementation.",

   "abstract": "Recently, several approaches for increasing spectral efficiency have been proposed to overcome the scarcity of spectral resources and to ensure that the ever-growing demand for high-data rate mobile communications can be met in the future. In this article, we focus on OFDM-based overlay systems that share a frequency band with already existing systems without degrading their performance. This is achieved by temporarily using those parts of the common frequency band that are currently not used by the licensed system. In particular, we focus on design issues for the physical layer as well as the medium access control layer and propose appropriate solutions for enabling coexistence. As a result, our investigations show that OFDM-based overlay systems are a promising approach for enhancing spectral efficiency.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a MIMO-based open wireless architecture for next-generation wireless systems. The use of space-time complementary coding in the proposed OWA scheme contributes to a great improvement in system performance due to the joint spatial diversity and multiplexing advantages achieved by the STCC-MIMO scheme. The proposed STCC-MIMO-based OWA scheme offers an unified platform that integrates various attractive features, such as link adaptation, spatial diversity and multiplexing trade-off, and accurate channel estimation. The application of innovative pair-wise complementary codes and offset stacking spread spectrum in the STCC-MIMO scheme helps to boost the overall spectral efficiency due to its near interference-free operation. MIMO systems play an extremely important role in 4G wireless, and therefore it is desirable that the OWA support different MIMO configurations. This article shows that the proposed STCC-MIMO scheme offers great flexibility to implement a MIMO system suitable for different diversity and multiplexing requirements",

First, it discusses the choice of integrated circuit technology for the radio frequency (RF) part and presents the status quo concerning standardization. Then, it describes the 60-GHz channel-propagation characteristics and proposes antenna solutions, as well as the architecture of the RF part, including a channelization scheme and frequency synthesizer architecture. With regard to the baseband part, we discuss the use of multicarrier modulation and compare it to single-carrier modulation. Finally, we demonstrate the consequences of the various design options as judged from link-budget calculations.",

WPAN and WLAN technologies play a fundamental role in enabling such integrated environment that is expected to support both medical and nonmedical applications. The ultimate goal is to exploit WPAN and WLAN technologies, as well as other wireless networks, such as 3G cellular systems and satellite networks, to support highly efficient medical care delivery, anytime and anywhere. However, the life-critical nature of some medical applications imposes additional challenges that have not been considered in nonmedical scenarios. This article discusses some future scenarios where WLAN and WPAN technologies can be used to provide an integrated and ubiquitous network in medical environments, and identifies the main issues to be addressed in order to meet the QoS requirements of different medical applications when operating in integrated environment",

   "abstract": "Web services orchestration is now being adopted for the coordination of real-time communications services, including telephony, video and multimedia communications. But do these communications services integrate into workflows in the same way as Web services in the data environment, and are orchestration mechanisms for Web services sufficient for the needs of workflows that involve real-time communications? In this article we explore these questions by taking a look at three approaches to orchestrating workflows: Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), Call Control extensible Markup Language (CCXML), and State Chart extensible Markup Language (SCXML). Through an analysis of these languages, we find that although there are similarities between BPEL as a Web services orchestration language and CCXML/SCXML as orchestration languages for telecom applications, certain key differences, namely procedural vs. event-based representation and coarse vs. fine task granularity, make it more suitable to use these two types of languages together rather than having one replace the other in converged voice-data applications.",

   "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer was designed primarily for indoor local area networks. Commercially available 802.11 radios suffer greatly reduced performance, even failing completely, when deployed outdoors, where long delay spreads cause self-interference, and vehicular mobility causes fast variations in the radio channel parameters. This article describes an advanced OFDM receiver that overcomes these problems. It works by combining all useful received energy, accounting for inter-symbol interference, and accurately tracking radio channel variations. Complexity and performance advantages arc gained by splitting the processing between the time and frequency domains. Computer simulations show that even for outdoor urban environments at speeds greater than 140 mph, this receiver delivers performance comparable to a non-mobile, indoor system.",

   "abstract": "The communications industry significantly lags behind the personal computing industry in terms of empowering the end user to innovate, as fundamental architectural shifts have yet to occur to push intelligence to the network edge. The decentralization of the telecommunication system to the edge of today's hierarchically formed networks is inevitable with the emergence of key wireless technologies and the proliferation of mobile computing devices and more prevailing usage models. This article envisions a decentralized communication system formed of wireless mesh networks and a highly virtualized, converged computing and communications node-based architecture with emergent management capabilities. We propose to embed the user inside the network to freely associate services and resources such as computing, storage, and bandwidth to rapidly advance network innovation - network-centric computing. This article proposes a novel direction and vision for network-centric computing, expands upon our research, and presents the OverMesh platform from which we have begun work to instantiate this vision. Finally, we expect this new envisioned network to coexist with today's Internet infrastructure and enable a new generation of applications and usage models",

Several standards bodies define the QoS control architectures based on their scope of work. This article first reviews the QoS control architectures defined in the standards bodies such as Cable Lab, DSL Forum, MSF, ETSI, and ITU-T. ITU-T NGN architecture provides the generic framework to cover the results of each standards body. Other architectures focus on solving specific problems. We explain in more detail the ITU-T QoS control architecture defined in resource and admission control functions (RACF) and discuss future standards developments.",

   "abstract": "Live video streaming is perhaps the greatest unfulfilled promise of the Internet. There have been tremendous efforts in the design and experimentation of video-streaming systems in the past two decades; there have been no shortage of technical innovations, yet no single system has delivered the scale and service quality. The fundamental problem that throttles the large-scale deployment of Internet video streaming is the dissatisfaction end-users experience with performance. This is caused by a combination of many factors, such as the autonomous nature of the Internet, inherent instability, and lack of a service guarantee. This is further challenged by sustainable bandwidth and the stringent continuity requirements of streaming applications. Recent development of P2P-based streaming technology brings unprecedented new momentum to Internet video streaming, which has been shown to be cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. This article reviews the state-of-the-art P2P live video-streaming technologies and their development from a historic perspective. Based on our earlier success with a large-scale P2P streaming system, Coolstreaming, we summarize the main innovations and discuss the key trade offs in the system design. We present our observations on the future development and offer a few insights for further discussion.",

In this article, we discuss some key issues that are relevant to enabling peer-to-peer streaming in networked consumer electronics and address possible technical solutions to the issues of interoperability, NAT/firewall traversal, and codec inflexibility. We also address how to improve overall system performance by introducing a notion of node coordinates into the discovery of services on a P2P network and confirm the effectiveness of our approach using simulation. We conclude with a discussion of our prototype CE-oriented P2P streaming system.",

   "abstract": "Future wireless communications will require multimode radio transceivers. This article looks at two possible transmitter architectures: direct upconversion and polar modulation. A brief review of the direct upconversion approach reveals some key limitations. This leads to a detailed study of the polar transmitter focusing on its operation, design challenges, and potential benefits. Its multi- mode capability and low power consumption are illustrated by a prototype design of a GSM, EDGE, and WCDMA polar transmitter. The efficiency of the polar transmitter is shown as a key enabler of future systems using OFDM modulation with high peak-to-average signals.",

   "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their potential use in many applications such as border protection and combat field surveillance. Given the criticality of such applications, maintaining a dependable operation of the network is a fundamental objective. However, the resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes and the ad hoc formation of the network, often coupled with an unattended deployment, pose non-conventional challenges and motivate the need for special techniques for dependable design and management of WSN. In this article, we highlight the potential of careful positioning of the base station (BS), which acts as a sink node for the collected data, as a viable means for increasing the dependability of WSN. We categorize published work on optimal positioning of BS in WSN. Referring to such work as static positioning, we further introduce dynamic schemes that reposition the BS during the network operation. We show that dynamic BS positioning can be very effective in optimizing the network functional and non-functional performance objectives and in coping with dynamic changes in the environment and available network resources",

   "abstract": "This article evaluates CDMA450 as a potential solution for rural data and voice connectivity. We begin by analyzing the main strengths of CDMA450, but also some of the potential limitations for rural coverage, from both a technical and an economic standpoint. We argue that CDMA450 is a promising technology, competitive in both capacity-centric urban environments and in coverage-centric rural environments. Consequently, we discuss the opportunities of providing universal coverage by adopting a business model targeting both urban and rural deployments, and utilizing urban to rural cross-subsidization. We then explore the advantages of deploying CDMA450 using a fixed wireless (WLL) model. To this end, we explore the effective range of WLL CDMA450, and the impact of using directional antennas and receive antenna diversity in real-world commercial CDMA450 deployment in Romania. If used properly, these techniques can aid us in increasing cell radii and thus lead to substantial cost benefits",

   "abstract": "Internet security threats are continually evolving as hackers try to stay ahead of countermeasures. In the last two years, a growing number of hackers have shifted their focus from straight-on firewall assaults and virus-laden emails - although these threats are not entirely things of the past - to Web-based attacks that expose Web site visitors to spyware, phishing scams, viruses, trojans, and other malicious code. An especially insidious new threat to Web users is the existence of malicious content residing in cached Web pages on storage and caching servers, such as those used by leading search engine providers, Web 2.0 sites, and Internet service providers (ISPs). This paper discusses the step-by-step process describing the infection method using search engine caching servers. The three examples of the type of Web threat, based on a recent analysis of Web pages on public storage and caching servers of three popular search engine providers are presented",

   "abstract": "The integration of different kinds of wireless mobile networks, or heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), is emerging. However, a systematic discussion with regard to the special requirements and the complexity of QoS-aware routing in such networks and how QoS is blended with routing is still largely missing. This article aims to cast some light on these aspects. Based on an analysis of the basic architecture of an emerging heterogeneous wireless network and its new requirements on QoS-aware routing, a policy-based QoS supporting system infrastructure and a QoS-aware routing algorithm called QRA are presented in this article. The presentation is specifically given to these issues and components that are unique to HWNs and its QoS routing. The evaluation results show the impact of different network parameters on the performance of QoS-aware routing in HWNs",

The major components in radio resource management (i.e., scheduling and admission control) and related research issues are discussed. We review related work in the literature. We propose a game-theoretic model for admission control in IEEE 802.11n-based WMNs using the MIMO-OFDM technology. The proposed scheme uses Q-learning, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm, to gain knowledge on system performance. Then this knowledge is used to determine payoff for the game formulation to obtain the Nash equilibrium for the decision on admitting or rejecting a new connection at a mesh router.",

   "abstract": "This article describes recent advances in cognitive communications. We combine the concepts of signal processing, communications, pattern classification, and machine learning to make dynamic use of the spectrum, such that the emanated signals do not interfere with the existing ones. Unlike other programs such as neXt Generation communications of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where radio scene analysis is performed to find the spectrum holes or the white space, we make use of the white, as well as the gray space for non- interfering signal transmission. We examine the possibility of employing machine perception and autonomous machine learning technologies to the autonomous design and analysis of air interfaces. The underlying premise is that a learning module will facilitate adaptation in the standard classification process so that the presence of new types of waveforms can be detected, features that best facilitate classification of the previously and newly identified signals can be determined, and waveforms can be generated by using the basis-set orthogonal to the ones present in the environment. Incremental learning and prediction allows knowledge enhancement as more snapshots of data are processed, resulting in improved decisions. Some of the contributions of this project include technological advances in signal detection, feature identification, signal classification, sub-space tracking, adaptive waveform design, machine learning, and prediction.",

   "abstract": "This article analyzes the wireless coverage problem of remote regions with low user density and propagation problems due to irregular terrain and high tree density. The use of a wireless mesh network is proposed as a solution where user data is transmitted directly to a base station when it is possible or relayed through other nodes in a multi-hop manner when there is not a direct link. The mesh topology uses short links with higher capacity instead of long links with low capacity. We analyze radio propagation and MAC protocols, including random sources, queues, and packet delays. The article is based on the coverage of a realistic rural region near Medellin, a mid size city in Colombia, and it shows that a wireless mesh network is an alternative to a typical cell based solution. It includes propagation analysis and MAC protocol behavior, so it is not limited to a radio coverage problem but also traffic, scheduling, and routing analysis",

   "abstract": "The success of peer-to-peer overlays for live multicast streaming depends on their ability to maintain low delays and a low ratio of information loss end-to-end. However, data distribution over an overlay consisting of unreliable peers is inherently subject to disturbances. Resilience is thus inevitably a key requirement for peer-to-peer live-streaming architectures. In this article, we present a survey of the media distribution methods, overlay structures, and error-control solutions proposed for peer-to-peer live streaming. We discuss the trade off between resilience and overhead and argue that efficient architectures can be defined only through thorough performance analysis.",

   "abstract": "Virtual private networks (VPNs) have rapidly emerged as a leading solution for multi-site enterprise communication needs. Provider-managed solutions modeled on RFC 2547 serve as a popular choice for layer 3 VPNs, and the hose model has emerged as a common and simple service specification. It offers a hose of a certain contracted bandwidth to customers. With the growth in size and number of VPNs and the uncertainties in the traffic patterns of customers, providers are faced with new challenges in efficient provisioning and capacity planning for these networks and satisfying customer service level agreements (SLA). We suggest that a set of techniques can be used to help the provider build an adaptively provisioned network. These techniques involve continually processing measurement information, building inferences regarding VPN characteristics, and leveraging them for adaptive resource provisioning. We developed scalable techniques to infer VPN characteristics that are important for provisioning tasks. We demonstrated the feasibility of such provisioning techniques with existing measurement obtained using SNMP infrastructure from a large IP/VPN service provider. Our examination of measurement data yielded interesting new insights into VPN structure and properties. Building on our experience with analyzing VPN characteristics, we articulate an adaptive provisioning architecture that enables providers to effectively deal with the dynamic nature of customer traffic",

   "abstract": "Automatic resource discovery plays a significant role in next-generation optical networks, where nodes can maintain a large number of input/output ports (fibers, wavelengths, time slots, etc.). This automation avoids long and tedious manual node configurations and minimizes resource misconfiguration probability, which can result in high cost savings for network operators. The generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been defined to provide such functionalities. However, it requires optical nodes to transmit in-band information, thus requesting link termination on each incoming port. This issue, in transparent optical networks, implies additional hardware, high complexities, or even signal losses. This article proposes and evaluates novel extensions to standard LMP that cope with the discovery of all-optical transport planes. In addition, playing a crucial role in ASON/GMPLS networks, this article also generically covers the automatic discovery of the control plane.",

   "abstract": "This article reviews routing algorithms in heterogeneous wireless networks with the goal of including QoS awareness. After a general overview of the issues and challenges of QoS provisioning over heterogeneous networks, classic routing strategies are revisited, and how they can be exploited to achieve QoS efficiency is discussed. In particular, for the considered scenarios our proposal is to account for some proactivity in the routing algorithms, as well as a QoS-driven control selection, which are shown to improve throughput, delay, and energy consumption. Finally, we introduce a general backward utility formulation for user satisfaction as a tool to capture complex and dynamic QoS variations",

The IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) is a recent standards initiative that outlines a service delivery platform (SDP) architecture. In practice, however, a number of service delivery platforms already were developed and commercially deployed. The existing implementations focus on the IT systems and domain for service design and delivery and accommodate the existing network implementations in their architectures. Such solutions may be viewed as IT-based designs whereas the newer emerging IMS standards provide greater detail on network element design. We have studied several IT-based service delivery platforms presenting longitudinal results from their deployment, including multimedia service usage, transaction demands, and external applications deployed. These characteristics may be used to further refine IMS based service delivery platforms by accommodating some of the functional characteristics supported in successful IT-based SDP systems. We present a consolidated set of SDP capabilities to meet this objective",

   "abstract": "Most approaches developed to query sensor-actuator networks (SANETs) are either application-specific or generic. Application-specific SANETs provide limited reusability, are not cost effective, and may require extensive reprogramming efforts to make the network able to serve new applications. Generic SANETs usually require that a sizeable code be deployed on the nodes regardless of the specific requirements of the application at hand. More important, they may not be optimized to fully exploit the specific characteristics and query patterns of a given application. In this article we introduce service-oriented SANETs (SOSANETs) as a novel approach to building customizable SANETs. SOSANETs provide the benefits of both application-specific SANETs (e.g., energy efficiency, scalability) and generic SANETs (e.g., reusability) and avoid most of their limitations. We implemented our approach in TinySOA, a SOSANET developed on top of TinyOS. We conducted an evaluation of TinySOA that included a comparison with TinyDB, an established query processing system for sensor networks. The obtained empirical results show that TinySOA outperforms TinyDB in many aspects including energy consumption, scalability, and response time.",

Consequently, the DoD should identify shared spectrum access opportunities and explore dynamic spectrum access technologies to help meet the growing spectrum requirements of the military. This article discusses a few cases of current and future shared spectrum access environments to highlight the circumstances for spectrum sharing and utilization of military and commercial frequency bands.",

In this article we analyze the formal status of IPv6 from different points of view. First, we present the main forces behind the development of the implementations that support IPv6 and the promotion of this technology. We then review the various conformance and interoperability testing initiatives with a special emphasis on the IPv6 Ready Logo Program. Finally, we analyze the state of the art of the certified IPv6 market implementations.",

   "abstract": "TCP is the predominant technology used on the Internet to support upper layer applications with reliable data transfer and congestion control services. Furthermore, it is expected that traditional TCP applications (e.g., Internet access) will continue to constitute the major traffic component during the initial deployment of wireless mesh networks. However, TCP is known for its poor throughput performance in wireless multihop transmission environments. For this article, we conducted simulations to examine the impact of two channel interference problems, the hidden terminal and exposed terminal, on TCP transmissions over wireless mesh networks. We also propose a multichannel assignment algorithm for constructing a wireless mesh network that satisfies the spatial channel reuse property and eliminates the hidden terminal problem. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the performance of TCP in wireless multihop networks.",

   "abstract": "Multimedia capturing and display devices of different resolutions and aspect ratios can be easily connected by networks and, thus, there is a great need to develop techniques that facilitate flexible image/video format conversion and content adaptation among these heterogeneous terminals. Quality degradation due to downsampling, up-sampling, coding/decoding, and some content adaptation mechanism (say, image mosaicking) in the transmission process is inevitable. It is desirable that multimedia contents can be easily captured, displayed, and seamlessly composed. Challenges and techniques to achieve this goal are reviewed first. Then, two specific topics, i.e., image/video mosaicking and super resolution (SR) conversion, are highlighted. As compared with previous work developed for these problems, the challenge under the current context is to strike a balance between low computational complexity and high quality of resultant image/video. Several new developments along this line are discussed",

   "abstract": "Recent market saturation and fierce competition among telcos and other access providers, including cable and wireless operators, are threatening telco's growth potential. Many \"traditional\" telcos around the world are making all-out efforts to discover new growth momentum not only for the existing market but also for the future market. A new direction to overcome the difficulties is desperately needed. In this situation, what should telcos do in the next five to ten years? How should they change? This article introduces Telco 2.0, which is the telco's new role and business model in the IP world to create customer value. Telcos should first perform their environment analysis, and then based on the results they can implement Telco 2.0 to create new revenue sources and overcome the difficulties. Telcos need to transform themselves into more customer-centric and highly innovative companies, and restore their role as true market leaders. This paper also briefly describes how Telco 2.0 is being implemented in a company, KT",

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless interoperator/intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. In this article we present a seamless mobility management approach that does not require changes to existing network infrastructure. The novelty of the proposed approach is that mobility management is fully controlled by the terminal, and network selection is user-centric, power-saving, cost-aware, and performance-aware. Total mobility management, including interface management, handover decision, and execution, is also detailed",

This framework, which includes the most common access networks (xDSL, UMTS, WiFi, and LAN) is being prototyped and tested in a multidomain scenario throughout Europe, composing what we call the EuQoS system. In this article we present the novel QoS routing mechanisms that are being developed and evaluated in the framework of this project.

   "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are in high demand for all sorts of tasks-video communication, resource sharing, and content retrieval, to mention a few. However, current P2P solutions are intrinsically incompatible with the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), the service provisioning framework adopted by the major telecommunication players. We look at ways to develop P2P applications over IMS, identifying the essential service components that pave the way toward interoperable P2P. We discuss the added value that a P2P-IMS solution offers to all parties involved in the service provisioning chain: content provider, third-party service provider, network operator, and ultimately, the user. P2P-IMS brings the power of P2P (increased scalability, availability, resilience, and resource utilization) to the future domain of services, creating a wealth of new business opportunities. Our findings are supported by an IMS-compliant prototype, including a variety of applications.",

   "abstract": "Unsolicited emails distributed by marketers and fraudsters are a growing burden on Internet users. It is expected that with the introduction of low-cost next-generation networks, such as the IP multimedia subsystem, these unsolicited communications will migrate from email and move to voice, video, and instant messaging sessions. Unsolicited voice and video calls are highly disruptive, causing frustration to end users, and they are wasteful of network resources. These communications also may involve fraud, phishing, or the propagation of offensive material. This article highlights the scale of this inevitable problem and proposes mechanisms to enable users to filter their incoming multimedia sessions, such that only legitimate calls are received. This is achieved in a variety of ways including call-pattern analysis, statistical filtering, blacklists, whitelists, and challenge-response mechanisms.",

The interactive return channel makes these new services possible. This channel allows TV viewers to interact by sending data back to the TV broadcaster. In this article we analyze the viability of a wireless ad hoc network to implement the return channel. For this purpose, an ad hoc network is a low-cost and flexible solution. We evaluate the performance of an ad hoc return channel using the IEEE 802.11 wireless technology for different Brazilian geographical scenarios. The results show that ad hoc networking is a promising solution for the return channel of Brazilian interactive digital TV",

   "abstract": "The ISO 18000 Part 6C UHF standard is becoming a widely accepted standard in RFID applications in supply chain management and is driving development of passive tags. The communication primitives of ISO 18000 Part 6C are significantly different and more complex than ISO 18000 Part 7. The complexity of the Part 6C standard makes the design of these tags extremely time consuming and challenging for reducing power consumption and silicon area. This article examines various features of the ISO Part 6C standard and compares it to the ISO Part 7 standard for active tags for the purpose of evaluating generic interrogator/tag protocol complexity. For a 0.16 mm ASIC implementation, the Query command from ISO 18000 Part 6C is more complex than 10 primitives of the simpler ISO 18000 Part 7 standard.",

   "abstract": "A time-limited lease is a set of rights that expires after a specified duration. We analyze ways to use leases to facilitate innovation in radio devices and wireless communication. In our vision, manufacturers include in their devices a simple, secure subsystem that contains a clock and disables specific transmit capabilities if no extension message is received by the end of the lease period. When devices provide this support, regulators may use certification leases rather than permanent grants to accelerate deployment of innovative radios. Spectrum rights holders may use leases to reduce risk in secondary spectrum market transactions. Firms collaborating in innovative wireless service business models can better retain control of their respective rights. We examine both the technical and policy issues associated with leases.",

   "abstract": "The most expensive costs in satellite communication are incurred by the space segment. Therefore, effort should be focused on the efficient use of this resource. One aspect is the optimization of the physical layer, to approach the Shannon limit of channel capacity. In IP-based networks, communication between arbitrary terminals can be established, which must hold for IP-based satellite networks as well. A commonly used topology is the star network, where data are routed via the master station, which in case of satellite communications introduces a double hop for terminal-to-terminal connections [1]. A double hop requires twice the bandwidth and twice the response time, which is very unattractive for interactive services. This drawback is avoided with a fully meshed topology, where terminals can communicate directly. Of course, an appropriately designed access system is required in this context. The well-known multi-frequency, time-division multiple access (MF-TDMA) scheme slices the channel capacity along both time and frequency axes. Each fragment (slot) can be used by any station for direct communication [2, 3]. This article describes the method on an abstraction layer, starting with the high-level timing that copes with frame numbers; the low-level timing that maps the frame numbers to time instants of the local time scale; and ends with the time stamp handled in the hardware, where calculation delays and filter flushing affect the received time stamp. Compared to commercial systems, the method described in this article uses differential time stamps, which reduces the effort of the synchronization procedure.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes an approach to IMS policy control based on session policies that achieve transparent end-to-end session establishments between IMS terminals. The article identifies drawbacks in the current IMS policy control methodology, discusses how these drawbacks may negatively influence the potential of IMS to provide innovative services, and describes how the new approach overcomes these drawbacks. Our proposal offers modularity and scalability properties that enable operators to establish policies and modify existing ones without major changes in the IMS core. Thus, policies can be applied transparently to SIP dialogs between terminals and modified on the fly without tearing down ongoing dialogs. The article also discusses a test bed implementation that worked as a proof-of-concept",

   "abstract": "As communications networks become increasingly dynamic, heterogeneous, less reliable, and larger in scale, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to effectively manage these networks using traditional approaches that rely on human monitoring and intervention to ensure they operate within desired bounds. Researchers and practitioners are pursuing the vision of autonomic network management, which we view as the capability of network entities to self-govern their behavior within the constraints of business goals that the network as a whole seeks to achieve. However, applying autonomic principles to network management is challenging for a number of reasons, including: (1) A means is required to enable business rules to determine the set of resources and/or services to be provided. (2) Contextual changes in the network must be sensed and interpreted, because new management policies may be required when context changes. (3) As context changes, it may be necessary to adapt the management control loops that are used to ensure that system functionality adapts to meet changing user requirements, business goals, and environmental conditions. (4) A means is required to verify modeled data and to add new data dynamically so that the system can learn and reason about itself and its environment. This article provides an introduction to the FOCALE autonomic network management architecture, which is designed to address these challenges.",

   "abstract": "A virtual private network provides network connectivity among the different sites of an enterprise. The bandwidth requirement of a VPN is typically specified by peak ingress-egress traffic volumes for each site. The actual distribution of traffic from each site to other sites in the VPN is not known a priori and could vary over time (e.g., at an intra-day or daily level or due to special activities). This is captured by the hose traffic model. It is the responsibility of the Internet service provider to provision the VPN so that variable traffic subject to aggregate ingress-egress constraints can be transported with bandwidth guarantees. We describe a capacity-efficient, robust, and traffic-oblivious routing strategy, called two-phase routing, that allows preconfiguration of the VPN such that all traffic patterns permissible within the network's natural ingress-egress capacity constraints can be routed with bandwidth guarantees. The scheme routes traffic in two phases: traffic entering the VPN is sent from the source to a set of intermediate nodes in predetermined split ratios that depend on the intermediate nodes, and then from the intermediate nodes to the final destination. (The traffic split ratios can also be generalized to depend on the source and/or destination of traffic.) A significant benefit of the described schemes is that the network can be configured for completely static operation while providing service-level guarantees to widely varying VPN traffic. This is unlike previous approaches based on direct source-destination routing, which need dynamic adaptation to changing traffic conditions in order to provide service-level guarantees",

   "abstract": "The transmission reach of signals in optical transmission systems is limited. To go beyond these transparent reach limits, signal regeneration is necessary to re-amplify, reshape, and retime the optical signals. Translucent optical networks are a type of optical transport network specifically devised to address such a concern by allowing for sparse but strategic signal regeneration in the network. Translucent optical networks seek a graceful balance between network design cost and service provisioning performance, and can achieve performance comparable to that of an all-electronic switching network, but requiring far fewer signal regenerators. Despite massive progress, there are many outstanding issues regarding the implementation of translucent networks planning and operation. This article reviews a range of translucent optical networks and discusses various research issues, particularly involving network planning, lightpath routing and wavelength assignment, and network survivability. We also suggest other potential research topics such as traffic grooming, fault detection, and multicasting for translucent networks",

   "abstract": "A new specification was released that, for the first time, \"standardizes\" the software and firmware infrastructure for a broad base of specialized signal processing devices used within the baseband signal/modem processing engines of an advanced wireless system. Dubbed MHAL, or modem hardware abstraction layer, this open specification facilitates the reuse of the functional software and firmware components that implement a radio's physical layer channel processing across different radio platforms. The benefits of such a specification are obvious: code reuse such as this provides significant savings in both the time to market and cost of development for subsequent radio products or upgrades to existing products. This in turn allows wireless original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to offer their customers radio technologies with new features and capabilities faster and at reduced overall cost. Even with this benefit, however, a question remains as to whether MHAL will be broadly adopted across the wireless market.",

The service oriented architectural paradigm has been recognized as one of the key enablers to achieve this. At the same time, Web services have become the de facto standard for implementing service oriented architecture. However, these technologies have been developed for environments with abundant data rates, environments which are very different from military tactical networks. In this article, we present possible solutions and remaining challenges on the way toward also realizing service oriented architecture on the tactical level. Our goal is to make it possible to take advantage of the benefits promised by this architectural paradigm at all military levels, ranging from strategic to tactical networks.",

   "abstract": "Network camera, made possible by recent advances in the integration of sensing, compression, and communication hardware, is a new video source that can be easily deployed and remotely managed. Unobtrusively located along highways, at airports, or in office buildings, such cameras can form a visual sensor network, or camera web, an extremely rich source of visual information. In its infancy today, camera web deployment will likely accelerate in the future and one can expect visual sensing devices to eventually become as ubiquitous as electric bulbs. While the capturing hardware has evolved tremendously, hardware and algorithms necessary for effective analysis and efficient communication of multi-camera data clearly lag. In this article, I overview one particular aspect of visual data analysis, namely, space-time video segmentation that is often a pre-requisite for motion estimation, video compression, event detection, scene understanding, etc. I introduce the concept of object tunnel, a 3-D surface in space-time through which a video object travels, and the associated concept of occlusion volume. I present examples of object tunnels and occlusion volumes on surveillance data that, upon further processing, may lead to automatic event detection or scene understanding. Finally, I describe challenges in extending video analysis algorithms to visual sensor networks, and I outline some possible approaches",

Important requirements for the handheld reader unit are ergonomic size and weight, sufficient battery life, and suitable read range for the desired applications. In addition, usability of the reader unit in terms of reading directions and orientations of tags has to be taken into account. This article presents a performance comparison of compact reader antennas for a handheld UHF RFID reader unit. The reader antennas presented in this study are designed to be affixed either inside the casing of the reader unit or into an external reader antenna module. The presented antenna designs have been optimized with finite element method modeling. The resonance frequency and bandwidth characteristics are analyzed using modeled and measured results. Read range measurement results with the antenna designs affixed to the handheld reader are presented and analyzed to verify the practical performance. All the antenna designs presented in this article are applicable to a handheld RFID reader unit.",

   "abstract": "WiMAX, worldwide interoperability for microwave access, is an emerging wireless communication system that can provide broadband access with large-scale coverage. As a cost-effective solution, multihop communication is becoming more and more important to WiMAX systems. To successfully deploy multihop WiMAX networks, security is one of the major challenges that must be addressed. Another crucial issue is how to support different services and applications in WiMAX networks. Since WiMAX is a relatively new standard, very little work has been presented in the literature. In this article we propose a secure and service-oriented network control framework for WiMAX networks. In the design of this framework we consider both the security requirements of the communications and the requirements of potential WiMAX applications that have not been fully addressed previously in the network layer design. The proposed framework consists of two basic components: a service-aware control framework and a unified routing scheme. Besides the design of the framework, we further study a number of key enabling technologies that are important to a practical WiMAX network. Our study can provide a guideline for the design of a more secure and practical WiMAX network",

   "abstract": "Broadband wireless access networks based on WiMAX can provide backhaul support for mobile WiFi hotspots. We consider an integrated WiMAX/WiFi network for such an application where the licensed WiMAX spectrum is shared by the WiFi access points/routers to provide Internet connectivity to mobile WiFi users. The WiMAX backbone network and WiFi hotspots are operated by different service providers. Issues such as protocol adaptation, quality of service support, and pricing for bandwidth sharing that are related to integration of these networks are discussed. In addition, we propose a model for optimal pricing for bandwidth sharing in an integrated WiMAX/WiFi network. A Stackelberg leader-follower game is formulated to obtain the optimal pricing solution for bandwidth sharing. Performance evaluation results reveal some interesting insights into the problem",

   "abstract": "The WiMAX standard specifies a metropolitan area broadband wireless access air interface. In order to support QoS for multimedia applications, various bandwidth request and scheduling mechanisms are suggested in WiMAX, in which a subscriber station can send request messages to a base station, and the base station can grant or reject the request according to the available radio resources. This article first compares two fundamental bandwidth request mechanisms specified in the standard, random access vs. polling under the point-to-multipoint mode, a mandatory transmission mode. Our results demonstrate that random access outperforms polling when the request rate is low. However, its performance degrades significantly when the channel is congested. Adaptive switching between random access and polling according to load can improve system performance. We also investigate the impact of channel noise on the random access request mechanism",

   "abstract": "The needs of Indian rural telecom, and the economics of currently available broadband access technologies, motivate a new system for rural broadband access, which we call WiFiRe (WiFi rural extension). The system leverages the widely available, and highly cost-reduced, WiFi chipsets. We, however, retain only the PHY from these chipsets and propose a single-channel, multisector, TDD MAC using directional antennas. The proposed WiFiRe MAC is similar to the WiMAX MAC in several respects. In this article we motivate our approach, describe the system architecture and the MAC, analyse the spatial reuse, and then, using a simple scheduler, provide an assessment of the voice and data capacity of a WiFiRe system",

Although it solves scalability issues, P2P technology experiences problems of a long start time and churn-induced instability that can greatly affect the user experience. Moreover, technical and business solutions for digital rights management are still under investigation. Great efforts are underway in both academia and industry to solve these problems, whose solution will offer a scalable, affordable, and legal TV-quality-like broadcast of content. In this article, we analyze what is available to the end user in terms of P2P video-streaming products and determine which of these are the most promising for IPTV and content distribution companies. In the following, we offer: (1) A survey of the available architectures. (2) A set of experiments on a popular peer-to-peer system, SopCast. (3) Guidelines for large scale deployment.",

   "abstract": "The XG Radio system uses dynamic spectrum access technology to determine locally unused spectrum, and then operates on these channels without causing interference to existing non-cooperative users. In August 2006 the XG Radio system was field tested at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, in the laboratory, and at field locations in Northern Virginia. There were three major test criteria: to cause no harm (avoid interference), to work (form and maintain connected networks), and to add value (efficiently use spectrum). This article defines the test metrics for fulfillment of these criteria, and describes the test results.",
