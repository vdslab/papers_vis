   "abstract": "Over the past few years, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have emerged as a leading technology for realizing transparent optical switching subsystems. MEMS technology allows high-precision micromechanical components such as micromirrors to be mass produced at low cost. These components can be precisely controlled to provide reliable high-speed switching of optical beams in free space. Additionally, MEMS offers solutions that are scalable in both port (fiber) count and the ability to switch large numbers of wavelengths (&gt; 100) per fiber. To date, most of this interest has focused on two-dimensional and three-dimensional MEMS optical crossconnect architectures. We introduce a wavelength-selective switch based on one-dimensional MEMS technology and discuss its performance, reliability, and superior scaling properties. We also review several important applications for this technology in all-optical networks.",

   "abstract": "For the past decade, a lot of Internet research has been devoted to providing different levels of service to applications. Initial proposals for service differentiation provided strong service guarantees, with strict per-flow bounds on delays, loss rates, and throughput, but required high overhead in terms of computational complexity and memory, both of which raise scalability concerns. Recently, the interest has shifted to class-based service architectures with low overhead. However, these newer service architectures only provide weak service guarantees, which do not always address the needs of applications. In this article we introduce a service architecture that supports strong per-class service guarantees, can be implemented with low computational complexity, and only requires maintenance of a little state information. A key mechanism of the proposed service architecture is that service rate allocation to classes is adaptive, and combined with buffer management. Furthermore, instead of using admission control or traffic policing, the proposed architecture exploits explicit congestion notification for the purpose of regulating the traffic entering the network.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes and demonstrates a WDM-based access network that directly connects end users over a wide area to the center node and provides guaranteed full-duplex Gigabit Ethernet access services to each of over 100 users. The center node employs an optical carrier supply module that generates not only the optical carriers for the downstream signals but also those for the upstream signals. The latter are supplied to optical network units (ONUs) at users' homes/buildings via the network. Since the ONUs simply modulate the optical carriers supplied from the center node via the network, they are wavelength-independent.",

   "abstract": "A networked home is a micro-version of the Internet, connecting home appliances, PCs, and other smart devices not only to one another but also to a globally connected world through the Internet. For consumers to embrace home networking, a solution that utilizes the existing infrastructure within the home, such as electrical wiring, is significant. However, the use of power lines as a home networking platform presents quite a troublesome and noisy environment that fluctuates with varying load impedance and time, and is also plagued by impulse noise. The latest developments in VLSI and DSP technologies have enabled power line communication (PLC) networks to compensate for the impairments of the environment. This article discusses the use of discrete multitone technology at the PHY layer of an in-home PLC network, particularly with reference to bit-loading techniques.",

   "abstract": "We propose an efficient hardware implementation of the advanced encryption standard algorithm, with key expansion capability. Compared to the widely used table lookup technique, the proposed basis transformation technique reduces the hardware overhead of the S-box by 64 percent. Our pipelined design has a very high throughput rate. Using typical 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS technology, a 200 MHz clock is easily achieved, and the throughput rate in the non-feedback cipher mode is 2.38 Gb/s for 128-bit keys, 2.008 Gb/s for 192-bit keys, and 1.74 Gb/s for 256-bit keys, respectively. Testability of the design is also considered. The hardware cost of the AES design is approximately 58 K gates using a standard synthesis flow.",

   "abstract": "This article describes an IBM approach for testing high-volume, complex RFICs at a fraction of the cost of the integrated circuit. This approach uses a personal computer, a fast benchtop dc parametric analyzer, and RF-to-analog circuits to test an RFIC during the manufacturing process. The described system and methodology are specifically designed for high-volume test, where test cost is extremely important; they are not recommended for lower-volume products (less than 1 million per month). This article describes the system architecture and discusses design, maintenance, and implementation considerations. The system is designed to reduce the cost of a complex RFIC manufacturing test to equal that of a discrete component, such as a resistor or capacitor. Given the relatively easy implementation and the drastic cost reduction associated with the test solution, this architecture establishes a new standard for the future of RF test. In fact, this architecture may result in the fastest RF tester currently available.",

   "abstract": "In this article we present the Self-Adaptive Universal Receiver (SAUR), a novel wireless reconfigurable receiver architecture. This scheme is based on blind recognition of the system in use, operating on a new radio interface comprising two functional phases. The first phase performs a wideband analysis (WBA) on the received signal to determine its standard. The second phase corresponds to demodulation. Here we only focus on the WBA phase, which consists of an iterative process to find the bandwidth compatible with the associated signal processing techniques. The blind standard recognition performed in the last iteration step of this process uses radial basis function neural networks. This allows a strong analogy between our approach and conventional pattern recognition problems. The efficiency of this type of blind recognition is illustrated with the results of extensive simulations performed in our laboratory using true data of received signals.",

   "abstract": "For high-speed networks, a restoration mechanism based on backup path (BP) provides a means for assuring their survivability. We propose a two-phase BP reservation mechanism for high-speed networks. In the admission phase, a pair of working path (WP) and backup path is selected from the provisioned sets of WPs and BPs. In the adjustment phase, if backup capacity utilization exceeds the preset threshold, BP assignments are rearranged to optimize the usage of backup capacity. A mathematical model is formulated to verify the quality of the optimized solutions. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the consumption of backup capacity while still maintaining a high degree of survivability. Moreover, experiments show that the optimized solutions obtained are on average within 3.6 percent of optimal.",

Several aspects of network design are subject to review to assess possible cost savings while maintaining service levels and reliability. This article focuses on Internet protocol network infrastructure design, and in particular investigates architectural options for interconnecting small \"IP metro\" PoPs to an \"IP core\" PoP. The baseline architecture is characterized by dual uplink circuits from the metro to the core PoP. Three variants of an alternative architecture based on a single uplink circuit from the metro to the core PoP are compared against the baseline network in terms of end-to-end availability/downtime and capital cost.",

The European research project AQUILA is committed to defining a DiffServ-based architecture for delivering on-demand QoS to requesting applications. Focal characteristics of the proposed solution are backward compatibility to the existing Internet and scalability to very large networks. To achieve such goals, AQUILA implements an overlaid distributed control layer, the resource control layer, implementing a novel mechanism for dynamic control of intradomain resources, the dynamic resource pool. On the interdomain aspects, the AQUILA architecture extends the BGRP framework for the aggregation of interdomain reservations to overcome scalability issues. This article describes the general AQUILA architecture, with a special focus on the DRP and BGRP mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "Services supported by asynchronous transfer mode account for the majority of data and Internet service revenues generated by carrier networks today. This is based on ATM's ability to support high availability services with quality of service. However, the influences of the Internet and a highly dynamic telecommunications market have raised demands for increased flexibility while controlling costs. Therefore, future carrier networks are likely to continue to be based on established technologies, such as ATM, as well as IP. In many cases, this is achieved through maintaining separate ATM and IP core networks, with the IP network supporting Internet services, while the ATM network continues to support guaranteed services such as private lines, broadband access, and video. In some cases, however, it can be advantageous for a carrier to transport segments of their ATM network over their IP network core; for example, to transport ATM traffic currently carried on leased facilities onto an IP network where the service provider owns the facilities. Developments in IP and MPLS-based traffic engineering and QoS may increase the ability of IP-based networks to support ATM services using MPLS. This article provides an overview of approaches enabling a network based on MPLS that naturally supports IP services to also support ATM services. The drivers and requirements for convergence on an IP/MPLS core network are presented, followed by an overview of the different approaches and associated challenges currently being debated in the standards bodies.",

   "abstract": "Admission control is a key component for QoS delivery in IP networks because it determines the extent to which network resources are utilized and whether the contracted QoS characteristics are actually delivered. Unlike most of the existing approaches, we adopt a holistic view and position the admission control in a unified architecture, where traffic engineering and service management interact in different levels of abstraction and timescale. Distinguishing between service subscription and invocation epochs, the applied admission logic is based on a feedback model, the operation of which can be tuned by operational policies and business strategies. The validity of the approach is supported by a scalability analysis while it has also been verified by a prototype system.",

   "abstract": "Today's digital subscriber line deployments are often conservatively engineered to function in a statistically worst case environment. Crosstalk is treated as unknown and uncontrollable random noise, even though it is manmade. Other impairments are often treated by simply adding margin to crosstalk. While this simplistic practice currently suffices, it often provisions unnecessarily low bit rates. This article shows methods that can increase these bit rates and decrease DSL failure rates. Data can be collected about individual telephone lines and cables from loop databases, by automated test equipment, or from DSL modems. This data may then be fed into an advanced DSL management system with a database of DSL loop and noise characteristics, and an analysis engine that tailors DSL deployments to the actual individual line characteristics, to increase provisioned DSL bitrates while simultaneously increasing reliability and lowering maintenance costs. The maximum service can be provisioned with high accuracy, eliminating many service activation failures. Automated maintenance routines can even isolate faults before a customer experiences them. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) treats crosstalk as the manmade noise it is, and jointly optimizes DSL transmit spectra and signals to minimize crosstalk and maximize received signals, allowing substantially higher DSL speeds than current practice. This opens the door for new services, including symmetric enterprise services and full video service, with minimal physical plant upgrade.",

A short review of the proposed standard approaches to QoS (e.g., differentiated services, integrated services, and label switching technologies) is given. Then we focus on the state-of-the-art architectures, mainly based on DiffServ concepts. Several issues arise when trying to implement these architectures in the real world: QoS aspects, network monitoring of the offered QoS, and end-user control of received QoS. The article then discusses the existing results and the current direction of European research and development in these areas.",

   "abstract": "In this article, signal processing techniques to combat the adverse communications environment on power lines are addressed, so as to enable reliable high speed data communications over low-voltage power distribution networks for Internet access and in-home/office networking. It is seen that multicarrier code-division multiple access, multiuser detection, and turbo decoding, having demonstrated their limit-approaching capacity in DSL and wireless communication systems, are readily applied to power line communications. In particular, it is argued that these methods can successfully mitigate the influence of the principal impairments in PLC channels: time-varying channel attenuation, multipath frequency-selective fading, multiple access interference, and background noise. Strategies to deal with the most unfavorable noise source, the impulse noise, are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "In a cable modem network, a cable modem (CM) talks to a cable modem termination system (CMTS) over a traditional cable-television network. The cable-industry-backed standard that specifies how a CM and CMTS talk to each other is called DOCSIS. In DOCSIS the CMTS schedules the upstream (CM-to-CMTS) channels, each of which is time-division multiplexed into a sequence of minislots. To schedule an upstream channel, the CMTS logically divides the channel into a contiguous sequence of intervals, each interval comprising a contiguous sequence of minislots. The CMTS assigns to each interval an interval type, which specifies how the CMs may use that interval. Initial maintenance intervals (IMIs) are used by CMs when they first come online. In some CMTS deployments, certain sets of upstream channels must be IMI aligned. A set of aligned channels has the property that for each IMI X mapped in any of those channels, all other channels in the set have an IMI that starts and ends at precisely the same time as X. This article describes a novel algorithm for aligning the IMIs in a set of DOCSIS upstream channels. This algorithm, which has been implemented and deployed in a real CMTS, is both efficient and flexible. In particular, it enables any set of channels to be aligned, even ones with different minislots sizes.",

The packet switching functions such as address recognition and routing are performed in the electrical domain after optical-to-electrical conversion. As more real-time applications come online, demand for bandwidth increases, and electronic processing may potentially become a bottleneck at the intermediate nodes along the network.

   "abstract": "Ad hoc networks, where mobile nodes communicate via multihop wireless links, facilitate network connectivity without the aid of any preexisting networking infrastructure. The intrinsic attributes of ad hoc networks, such as dynamic network topology, limited battery power, constrained wireless bandwidth and quality, and large number of heterogeneous nodes, make network management significantly more challenging than stationary and wired networks. In particular, the conventional client/server-based manager/agent management paradigm falls short of addressing these issues. We describe the Guerrilla management architecture to facilitate adaptive and autonomous management of ad hoc networks. The management capability of Guerrilla is scalable to accommodate the sheer number and heterogeneity of nodes, autonomous and survivable to adapt to network dynamics, and economical to minimize management overhead.",

   "abstract": "Telecommunications and next-generation network IP-based services can be increasingly delivered at network edges and in peered third-party networks. As a result, subscribers bypass operators' services in favor of alternative novel services; accordingly, potential revenue is lost. By bundling existing viable network-based services across providers, however, service providers can create new revenues and avoid further erosion of their market share. Business announcements attest to this growing trend, but thus far cross-provider solutions take the form of point-to-point customized integrations. In the emerging service delivery paradigm, providers must be able to interwork fluidly with partners already operating profitable services, and do so without going through the risky and costly service development cycle, and without the need for extensive customized software development. We outline an intelligent-agent-based service peering and aggregation server whose deployment on service provider networks enables such interworking.",

   "abstract": "This article gives an overview of the effort underway in ITU-T SG 13 on an architectural framework for QoS support in packet networks, with a focus on IP. Provisionally named Y.qosar, the framework is to be published as a new ITU-T Recommendation. At the center of the architectural framework is a set of QoS network mechanisms distributed across three logical planes (the control, data, and management planes) to control network performance. Ultimately the network mechanisms are to be used in combination to deliver the satisfactory collective effect of service performance. The article also provides pointers to standards efforts dealing with specific QoS network mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "Optical burst switching is a promising solution for all-optical WDM networks. It combines the benefits of optical packet switching and wavelength routing while taking into account the limitations of the current all-optical technology. In OBS, the user data is collected at the edge of the network, sorted based on a destination address, and grouped into variable sized bursts. Prior to transmitting a burst, a control packet is created and immediately sent toward the destination in order to set up a bufferless optical path for its corresponding burst. After an offset delay time, the data burst itself is transmitted without waiting for a positive acknowledgment from the destination node. The OBS framework has been widely studied in the past few years because it achieves high traffic throughput and high resource utilization. However, despite the OBS trademarks such as dynamic connection setup or strong separation between data and control, there are many differences in the published OBS architectures. In this article we summarize in a systematic way the main OBS design parameters and the solutions that have been proposed in the open literature.",

   "abstract": "The advent of software radios has brought a paradigm shift to radio design. A multimode handset with dynamic reconfigurability has the promise of integrated services and global roaming capabilities. However, most of the work to date has been focused on software radio base stations, which do not have as tight constraints on area and power as handsets. Base station software radio technology progressed dramatically with advances in system design, adaptive modulation and coding techniques, reconfigurable hardware, A/D converters, RF design, and rapid prototyping systems, and has helped bring software radio handsets a step closer to reality. However, supporting multimode radios on a small handset still remains a design challenge. A configurable computing machine, which is an optimized FPGA with application-specific capabilities, show promise for software radio handsets in optimizing hardware implementations for heterogeneous systems. In this article contemporary CCM architectures that allow dynamic hardware reconfiguration with maximum flexibility are reviewed and assessed. This is followed by design recommendations for CCM architectures for use in software radio handsets.",

   "abstract": "The main degrading factor in indoor wireless optical communication systems for bit rates up to several megabits per second is the shot noise induced by ambient light (sunlight and artificial light produced by incandescent and fluorescent lamps). Due to the directional nature of both signal and ambient light noise, the spatial distribution of the signal-to-noise ratio in indoor environments can show large variations. This article compares techniques that are able to mitigate the effect of such SNR variations: rate-adaptive transmission and angle diversity. In the first technique, the effective data rate is adjusted to the local SNR conditions by introducing different levels of redundancy. The second technique explicitly explores the directionality of the SNR by combining signals collected from different observation angles. We address the performance of rate-adaptive transmission and angle diversity techniques, and compare them based on experimental results obtained in a typical indoor environment.",

   "abstract": "The opportunities and constraints for application of beamforming techniques in UMTS are reviewed and compared by means of extensive dynamic network-level simulations. We start by reviewing the physical layer specifications for UMTS in order to clarify which channels are allowed to use beamforming. Second, radio resource management for cells with beamforming capabilities are addressed from a standardization and algorithmic point of view. The exchange of beamforming specific measurement reports between the base station (Node-B) and the radio network controller is discussed as well as beam switching mechanisms, directional power-based admission control, and more. In addition to implementation of beamforming within logical cells, options for exploiting the antenna array to synthesize independent sector beams are also investigated (i.e., higher order sectorization via beamforming). The presented results show that beamforming within logical cells is an effective enabler for higher system capacity, while the use of beamforming for creation of many logical cells is less attractive due to significantly larger soft handover overhead and somewhat reduced capacity gain.",

   "abstract": "Current trends in the information and communications technology industry clearly indicate the existence of a business requirement for a market-enabling technology that allows network operators to interact with users in a seamless, transparent manner for the sale and delivery of a wide range of services with guaranteed quality of service. In this context the need arises for the dynamic creation, configuration and delivery of services with QoS guarantees via the automated management of service level agreements. The aim of the Cadenus project is to bring theoretical and practical contributions to this area by defining a framework for the provisioning of advanced communication services in premium IP networks. Such networks might be characterized by a high degree of complexity, in terms not only of scale, but also of number of operators and technological heterogeneity. Our contribution is twofold, comprising both the design of the proposed framework and its actual implementation. An innovative approach was taken to framework design, based on the concept of mediation. With respect to the framework implementation, an example illustrating the realization of a virtual private network scenario is presented.",

Graphs not only describe the codes, but, more important, they structure the operation of the sum-product decoding algorithm (or one of many possible variations), which can be used for iterative decoding. Such coding schemes have the potential to approach channel capacity, while maintaining reasonable decoding complexity. In this tutorial article we review factor graphs, which can be used to describe codes and the joint probability distributions that must be dealt with in decoding. We also review the sum-product algorithm, and show how this algorithm leads to iterative decoding algorithms for codes defined on graphs.",

High-data-rate communication over power lines is an exemplar case: while power lines are a potentially convenient and inexpensive \"no new wire\" medium for data transmission, their features make it very difficult to design a simple modem. In this article we illustrate the main features of the power line communication channel, and some of the solutions advocated for modem design.",

   "abstract": "In the near future general household appliances, such as televisions, refrigerators, alarm clocks, stoves, and even lights, will be supplemented with a network interface connecting them to the Internet. Homes are being equipped with such networked appliances to allow a more convenient way of living. Such extensive automatic control of appliances leads to the concept of the smart home. Behind such automation, there is a lot of software controlling the appliances. This software, often referred to as services, applications, or bundles, is supplied by a range of service provider businesses. Hence, in a single home, appliances may be controlled by a multitude of services offered by a wide variety of different providers. Moreover, some services may require the use of other services. Importantly, these businesses are completely independent and may not even be aware of one another or their products. Hence, appliances may be controlled by more than one service, and indeed these controlling services are often trying to achieve different goals. This causes compatibility issues that need to be resolved for networked appliances to be successful in the mass market. This problem is well known in telephony and historically is referred to as the feature interaction problem. This article discusses the issue of compatibility between services in a home environment. Reasons why and how services interact are discussed, and a taxonomy of interactions is presented. Finally, an approach is presented that prevents interactions. The approach presented uses accepted and known device and protocol interworking techniques. Throughout the article a number of example scenarios are used to illustrate the issues. However, the emphasis of the article is not only to present sample services for controlling home appliances or identify specific interactions between such services, but to find a general solution to the feature interaction problem that can automatically detect interactions between services in the home.",

   "abstract": "In classical networks, charging and billing are important tools for customer care to fight competition and to assure the operator's revenue. If charging is to remain a prime competitive tool in next-generation networks, it must be functionally intelligent and flexible, and able to optimize operator and service provider revenues while providing a fair policy toward the end users. Multimedia sessions can be considered as being composed of a number of call components, each of which might consist of different bearer and service objects. The NGN multimedia network structure and its business model define four players involved in charging: access provider, connection provider, telecommunication service provider, and value-added service provider. Often charging components must be correlated to create a clear postpaid bill and ensure correct treatment of prepaid accounts, as well as settlement between the providers involved.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a tutorial overview of the class of concatenated convolutional codes with interleavers, also known as turbo-like codes. They are powerful codes, formed by a number of encoders connected through interleavers, endowed by a decoding algorithm that splits the decoding burden into separate decoding of each individual code. Refinement of successive estimates of the information sequence is obtained by iterating the procedure of passing from one decoder to the other likelihood information decorrelated by the interleaver action. The key issues of code analysis and design are covered at the level of broad comprehension, without paying attention to analytical details.",

   "abstract": "The upper SHF and EHF radio bands (above about 20 GHz) offer abundant available bandwidth for access to metropolitan area networks by fixed broadband wireless access (FBWA) systems. However, these systems must withstand significant propagation impairments, especially shadowing by obstacles and rainfall attenuation. We describe the results of propagation measurements and modeling of coverage, and consequences for FBWA system design, notably antenna placement, use of repeaters, and diversity. High (&gt; 90 percent) coverage generally requires line-of-sight placement, although some non-line-of-sight coverage is possible for short distance and with judicious use of repeaters and macrodiversity.",

This article highlights some of the past accomplishments and promising research avenues for an important topic in the creation of future wireless networks. We address the issue of cross-layer networking, where the physical and MAC layer knowledge of the wireless medium is shared with higher layers, in order to provide efficient methods of allocating network resources and applications over the Internet. In essence, future networks will need to provide \"impedance matching\" of the instantaneous radio channel conditions and capacity needs with the traffic and congestion conditions found over the packet-based world of the Internet. Furthermore, such matching will need to be coordinated with a wide range of particular applications and user expectations, making the topic of cross-layer networking increasingly important for the evolving wireless buildout.",

Certain characteristics of delay-insensitive logic can be exploited using unique architectures to reduce digital switching noise and whiten the noise signature. The result is enhanced mixed mode performance in highly integrated systems. The performance enhancement of an interpolating digital-to-analog converter is presented as a specific example. Because the concept of delay-insensitive logic is not familiar to most engineers, a brief introduction to the general concept is given.",

   "abstract": "Increasingly, network applications must communicate with counterparts across disparate networking environments characterized by significantly different sets of physical and operational constraints; wide variations in transmission latency are particularly troublesome. The proposed Interplanetary Internet, which must encompass both terrestrial and interplanetary links, is an extreme case. An architecture based on a \"least common denominator\" protocol that can operate successfully and (where required) reliably in multiple disparate environments would simplify the development and deployment of such applications. The Internet protocols are ill suited for this purpose. We identify three fundamental principles that would underlie a delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and describe the main structural elements of that architecture, centered on a new end-to-end overlay network protocol called Bundling. We also examine Internet infrastructure adaptations that might yield comparable performance but conclude that the simplicity of the DTN architecture promises easier deployment and extension.",

   "abstract": "The combination of 3G and WLAN wireless technologies offers the possibility of achieving anywhere, anytime Internet access, bringing benefits to both end users and service providers. We discuss interworking architectures for providing integrated service capability across widely deployed 3G cdma2000-based and IEEE 802.11-based networks. Specifically, we present two design choices for integration: tightly coupled and loosely coupled, and recommend the latter as a preferred option. We describe in detail the implementation of a loosely coupled integrated network which provides two kinds of roaming services, a SimpleIP service and a Mobile-IP service. We present, in detail, two new components used to build these services: a network element called a WLAN integration gateway deployed in WLAN networks; a client software on the mobile device. For a mobile device with interfaces to both technologies, our system supports seamless handoff in the presence of overlapping radio coverage.",

   "abstract": "The tremendous growth in wireless LANs has generated interest in technologies that provide higher data rates and greater system capacities. The IEEE 802.11a standard, based on coded OFDM modulation, provides nearly five times the data rate and at least 20 times the overall system capacity compared to the incumbent 802.11b wireless LAN systems. This article describes the design challenges and circuit implementation of a two-chip set that forms a complete 802.11a solution in 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS technology. Wherever possible, sophisticated digital signal processing techniques are used to compensate for possible analog impairments associated with integrating RF circuitry in a CMOS technology. The analog portion of the chip set implements a 5 GHz transceiver comprising all the necessary RF and analog circuits of the 802.11a standard integrated on a single chip. Some features of this IC include 22 dBm peak transmitted power, 8 dB overall receive-chain noise figure, and -112 dBc/Hz synthesizer phase noise at 1 MHz frequency offset. The digital portion of the chip set, the baseband and MAC processor, contains dual ADCs/DACs and all the digital circuits for synchronization, detection, and 802.11 MAC layer data processing. This IC delivers up to 54 Mb/s in a 20 MHz channel according to the 802.11a standard, and includes proprietary modes supporting up to 108 Mb/s in a 40 MHz channel.",

In this article we propose an extension of RSVP to provide the needed mechanism, coined dynamic RSVP (DRSVP), to dynamically adjust reserved resources on nodes without much effort. It provides different video resolutions to different receiver nodes with different needed reserved resources. Therefore, it does not waste precious Internet resources to transmit unnecessary multimedia packets.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive techno-economic evaluation of two upgrade strategy cases for broadband IP services for residential and business customers, and illustrates their respective merits and pitfalls, allowing the definition of a reasonable investment policy. The work should enable establishment of guidelines for broadband infrastructure upgrade strategies from the incumbent operator's view. Following the definition of appropriate service sets, and taking into account demand scenarios established within the project, this work has been focused on developing a techno-economic model, based on the TONIC tool. Tariff structures have been applied to compute the key economic indicators, net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period. This investment analysis was carried using the tool, which was developed by IST-TONIC. The results show that the choice of technology (Ethernet or ATM) has almost no effect on the cost level and profitability of the cases. For the suburban area, a fiber to the cabinet solution is too expensive due to heavy infrastructure investments; for dense urban and urban areas the FTTC solution is worth the investments. The FTTH/office deployment scenario is only profitable in dense urban areas (&gt;5000 potential customers/km<sup>2</sup>) and already highly risky in the urban area.",

However, their performance can be compromised by inadvertent interactions with the higher-layer TCP flow control protocol. Maximizing the performance of wireless links requires that mechanisms operating at every layer of the protocol stack interact efficiently. This article provides a brief tutorial of some of these radio link enhancements. It then outlines how higher-layer flow control protocols should behave, and provides techniques for taming the behavior of TCP, to ensure that the performance of lower-layer enhancements is not compromised.",

   "abstract": "As we move toward next-generation all-IP wireless networks, we are facing the integration of heterogeneous networks, such as WWAN and WLAN, where vertical handoff is required. In vertical handoff between WWAN and WLAN, mobile hosts should be able to move freely across different networks while satisfying QoS requirements for a variety of applications. In order to achieve seamless handoff and maintain continuity of connection, we propose a novel mobility. management system that integrates a connection manager to detect network condition changes in a timely and accurate manner, and a virtual connectivity manager that uses an end-to-end principle to maintain a connection without additional network infrastructure support. A prototype system was built to test the effectiveness of the proposed system. Experiments show that seamless roaming between WLAN and WWAN can be achieved, and much better performance can be obtained than with the traditional scheme.",

The article starts by describing the problems encountered in power line communication channels in terms of frequency response and noise characteristics, and explains how in-home power line LANs can be extended to the neighborhood transformer. OFDM physical layers providing speeds of 45 Mb/s and 200 Mb/s as well as QoS and security are introduced. Finally, the results of large tests involving several thousands of nodes are described.",

These improvements are mainly for the support of high-speed wireless packet data service on the forward (base station to mobile station) link. A new shared channel, the forward packet data channel, F-PDCH, is introduced to significantly increase spectral efficiency. This is accomplished through smart, channel-dependent scheduling of base station, BS, resources by taking advantage of the delay-tolerant nature of data traffic. This shared channel utilizes fast link adaptation through adaptive modulation and coding supported by the feedback of channel quality information. A form of hybrid ARQ type II technique commonly referred to as asynchronous adaptive incremental redundancy compensates for frame error events due to imperfect link adaptation. The impact of the new channel on voice capacity of the system is designed to be minimal because the F-PDCH utilizes resources that are not consumed by real-time users.",

   "abstract": "Forwarding state scalability is one of the critical issues that delay the multicast deployment in IP networks. With traditional multicast routing protocols, a forwarding tree is built for each multicast session, and each router is required to maintain a forwarding entry for each multicast session whose distribution tree passes through the router. This poses the multicast forwarding state scalability issue when the number of concurrent multicast sessions is very large. We first present a survey of existing work addressing this scalability issue for providing scalable IP multicast. Then we extend an existing multicast routing protocol, Multicast Extension to OSPF (MOSPF), to scale well with respect to the number of concurrent multicast sessions by introducing tunnel support. This extension aims to reduce the protocol overhead associated with MOSPF. Simulation results show that the extension can significantly reduce multicast forwarding state and computational overhead at routers without affecting the per-destination shortest path characteristic of a resulting tree or introducing extra control overhead.",

   "abstract": "Gigabit Ethernet networks have seen great demand in recent years. This growth was fueled by both an increase in port speed at the client side and new applications in MAN and WAN space. In this article, we report a highly integrated Ethernet switch IC design that supports 12 gigabit ports and one 10 Gb port. All packet memory and search memory are integrated on chip. A deeply pipelined structure with parallel memory access is employed to achieve wirespeed search performance. A flexible policy engine is designed to allow packet filtering and modification. A novel tail buffer architecture is proposed to address the variable packet length issue in the shared buffer architecture. Custom mixed-signal circuits are incorporated to implement the 10G Ethernet interface in XGMII. The chip integrates 70 million transistors in a 16 mm \u00d7 15 mm die using 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. The chip has been tested to verify the wirespeed searching and switching performance.",

   "abstract": "Optical wireless LANs have the potential to provide bandwidths far in excess of those available with current or planned RF networks. There are several approaches to implementing optical wireless systems, but these usually involve the integration of optical, optoelectronic, and electrical components in order to create transceivers. Such systems are necessarily complex, and the widespread use of optical wireless is likely to be dependent on the ability to fabricate the required transceiver components at low cost. A number of UK universities are currently involved in a project to demonstrate integrated optical wireless subsystems that can provide line-of-sight in-building communications at 155 Mb/s and above. The system uses two-dimensional arrays of novel microcavity LED emitters and arrays of detectors integrated with custom CMOS integrated circuits to implement tracking transceiver components. In this article we set out the basic approaches that can be used for in-building optical wireless communication and argue the need for an integrated and scalable approach to the fabrication of transceivers. Our work aimed at implementing these components, including experimental results and potential future directions, is then discussed.",

   "abstract": "At present, WLANs supporting broadband multimedia communications are being developed and deployed around the world. Standards include HIPERLAN/2 defined by ETSI BRAN and the 802.11 family defined by the IEEE. These systems provide channel adaptive data rates up to 54 Mb/s (in a 20 MHz channel spacing) over short ranges up to 200 m. The HIPERLAN/2 standard also specifies a flexible radio access network that can be used with a variety of core networks, including UMTS. It is likely that WLANs will become an important complementary technology to 3G cellular systems and will typically be used to provide hotspot coverage. In this article the complementary use of WLANs in conjunction with UMTS is presented. In order to quantify the capacity enhancement and benefits of cellular/hotspot interworking we have combined novel ray tracing, software-simulated physical layer performance results, and optimal base station deployment analysis. The study focuses on an example deployment using key lamppost mounted WLAN access points to increase the performance (in terms of capacity) of a cellular network.",

Future access networks will provide full service integration, resource sharing at the packet level, and QoS support. It is expected that using IP as the base technology, the ideal plug-and-play scenario, where the management actions of the access network operator are kept to a minimum, will be achieved easily. In this article we start by giving a historical perspective of the evolution of access networks. We then describe an IP-based architecture targeted for integrated support of broadband multimedia services, designed to be low-cost and easily manageable. We illustrate the different phases of a multimedia Internet access session, when using SIP for session initiation, COPS and DIAMETER for QoS policy management, and AAA and RSVP for resource reservation.",

   "abstract": "Without any doubt, broadband Internet access is one of the most successful services offered by telecom operators today. It gives the operator the potential of offering many new services to residential and business customers, thereby introducing new revenue streams. ATM today provides a solid solution for this. At the same time, packet-based aggregation technologies -especially Gigabit Ethernet are becoming popular for offering connectivity services to business customers. The success of packet-based aggregation technologies is mainly driven by their lower cost compared to established cell-based solutions. This article addresses a number of requirements that must be fulfilled by the access network if it is used to provide multiple services. It will be shown how MPLS and Ethernet can be used in a broadband access architecture. Both meet many of the identified requirements, but still require some standardization before reaching the same maturity as their cell-based counterpart. It will be shown how MPLS technology can be used to seamlessly link cell and packet-centric networks together. This gives operators the possibility to keep the benefits of their existing cell-based infrastructure and smoothly evolve toward a packet-centric approach when the time is right.",

   "abstract": "Error control coding is a key element of any digital wireless communication system, minimizing the effects of noise and interference on the transmitted signal at the physical layer. In 3G mobile cellular wireless systems, error control coding must accommodate both voice and data users, whose requirements vary considerably in terms of latency, throughput, and the impact of errors on the user application. At the base station, dedicated hardware or readily reconfigurable components are needed to address the concurrent coding and decoding demands of a large number of users with different call parameters. In contrast, the encoder and decoder at the user equipment (UE) are dedicated to a single call setup which changes infrequently. In designing encoder and decoder solutions for 3G wireless systems, not only are the performance issues important, but also the costs. Cellular wireless infrastructure manufacturers need to reduce costs, maximize system reuse, and increase flexibility in order to compete in the market. Furthermore, future-proofing a network is a primary concern due to the high cost of deployment. For the UE, power consumption (battery life) and size are key constraints in addition to manufacturing costs. This article considers the 3G decoder design problem and, using case studies, describes two 3G decoder solutions using ASICs. The first device is targeted for base station deployment and is based on a unified architecture for convolutional and turbo decoding. The second device is a dedicated high-speed radix-4 logMAP turbo decoder targeted for UE, motivated by the requirements for high-speed downlink packet access. Both devices have been fabricated in 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology, and while optimized for either base station or UE, may be used in both applications.",

   "abstract": "A mismatch between demand and supply for bandwidth is common in transport carrier networks. This mismatch is generally a result of the disparity between a carrier's capacity buildout and its anticipated customer demand. A carrier with temporary bandwidth deficit or lack of presence in a geographical region and a carrier with surplus capacity in the right locations can be brought together by the emerging bandwidth exchange technology. Bandwidth exchange offers a win-win solution, in which the carrier with a deficit avoids losing revenue by buying capacity from the carrier with surplus, and the latter makes additional revenue by retail sale of its excess capacity. While the concept of real-time purchase and exchange of bandwidth has attracted a lot of attention, many technical challenges stand in the way of making it a reality. The purpose of this article is to provide an engineering framework for enabling real-time bandwidth exchange with committed quality of service and service level agreement among transport carriers. Special emphasis is given to identifying the architectural requirements and the enabling infrastructure necessary for building a viable bandwidth exchange that can be used for creating revenue out of surplus stranded capacity. Indepth analysis of cross-carrier service level agreement specification, capacity publication, route design, and service provisioning are also provided in the article.",

We discuss the utilization of these techniques across interdomain boundaries in the global Internet. We first analyze the characteristics of interdomain traffic on the basis of measurements from three different Internet service providers and show that a small number of sources are responsible for a large fraction of the traffic. Across interdomain boundaries, traffic engineering relies on a careful tuning of the route advertisements sent via the border gateway protocol. We explain how this tuning can be used to control the flow of incoming and outgoing traffic, and identify its limitations.",

The enabling functionalities include the reuse of 3GPP subscription, network selection, 3GPP system-based authentication, authorization and security key agreement using SIM/USIM card, user data routing and service access, as well as end user charging. The interworking functionalities are achieved without setting any 3GPP specific requirements for the actual WLAN access systems, but relying on the existing functionality available in a typical WLAN access network based on IEEE 802.11 standards.",

In order to optimize usage of radio resource and jointly designed from the user perspective, a joint scheduling mechanism allowing traffic to be split over a tightly coupled radio network supported by an adaptive radio multihoming approach is deliberately discussed. With respect to the time-division access scheme in HIPERLAN/2, which is selected as one example of WLAN, algorithms and performance of traffic scheduling in such a radio access technology are given. The required synchronization scheme supporting traffic splitting is also introduced.",

   "abstract": "Implementation constraints on iterative decoders applying message-passing algorithms are investigated. Serial implementations similar to traditional microprocessor datapaths are compared against architectures with multiple processing elements that exploit the inherent parallelism in the decoding algorithm. Turbo codes and low-density parity check codes, in particular, are evaluated in terms of their suitability for VLSI implementation in addition to their bit error rate performance as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. It is necessary to consider efficient realizations of iterative decoders when area, power, and throughput of the decoding implementation are constrained by practical design issues of communications receivers.",

   "abstract": "The management information models currently used in the Internet have several limitations. Some of them contain errors, are missing important features, or are difficult to understand. Second, standards bodies keep reinventing the wheel, which confuses the terminology (hence customers) and wastes precious time. Third, finding a good balance between too abstract, and overly detailed models is a tough challenge, rarely achieved in practice. Last, the learning curve of existing data models is too steep. We propose to alleviate these problems by adopting a new process for designing and standardizing management information models. It is inspired by two techniques form software engineering: the iterative and incremental software development process, which addresses the shortcomings of the waterfall process usually adhered to by the IETF and DMTF; and multi-tier models, which capture different perspectives (e.g., analysis, design, and implementation) of the information model. Our main innovations are management-architecture-neutral universal information models (UIMs), sharing of conceptual models by different standard bodies, and specialization of the people involved in designing the different layers of the models. Our new process takes into account a number of constraints identified in real-life environments.",

   "abstract": "We present a new optics-based transport architecture that emulates fast switching in the network core via emerging fast tunable lasers at the network edge, and bypasses the need for fast optical switching and buffering. The new architecture is capable of handling both asynchronous and synchronous traffic, for dealing with various bandwidth granularities and responding to dynamic changes in end-to-end traffic demands. The architecture also reduces the amount of layering in the transport network by eliminating packet and TDM switching, keeps the network core light (lightweight and transparent), and pushes intelligence to the network edge. We discuss technical challenges that arise in the new architecture and describe possible approaches to address them.",

   "abstract": "The need for critical improvements to the North American surface transportation infrastructure vis-a-vis alleviation of congestion while enhancing public safety has led to new intelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructure based on vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) wireless communications. The allocation of 75 MHz in the 5.9 GHz band for dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) may also enable future delivery of rich media content to vehicles at short to medium ranges via vehicle-to-roadside (v2e) links. Recently, AASTM committee E17.51 endorsed a variant of the IEEE wireless LAN standard, denoted 802.11a roadside applications (R/A), as the platform for the DSRC link and data link layer. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of DSRC applications and assess IEEE802.11 PHY and MAC layer characteristics in this context. It is anticipated that current 802.11 specifications need to be suitably altered to meet requirements for DSRC environments of multihop connectivity, high vehicle mobility, and heterogeneous services with a variety of QoS requirements for which the original design was not intended. This article captures the current state of the art of 802.11-based multiple access protocols and highlights open research issues.",

   "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming an increasingly important technology that will be used in a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure management, public safety, medical, home and office security, transportation, and military. WSNs will also play a key role in pervasive computing where computing devices and people are connected to the Internet. Until now, WSNs and their applications have been developed without considering a management solution. This is a critical problem since networks comprising tens of thousands of nodes are expected to be used in some of the applications above. This article proposes the MANNA management architecture for WSNs. In particular, it presents the functional, information, and physical management architectures that take into account specific characteristics of this type of network. Some of them are restrict physical resources such as energy and computing power, frequent reconfiguration and adaptation, and faults caused by nodes unavailable. The MANNA architecture considers three management dimensions: functional areas, management levels, and WSN functionalities. These dimensions are specified to the management of a WSN and are the basis for a list of management functions. The article also proposes WSN models to guide the management activities and the use of correlation in the WSN management. This is a first step into a largely unexplored research area.",

   "abstract": "Three-stage Clos network switches are an attractive solution for future broadband packet routers due to their modularity and scalability. Most three-stage Clos network switches assume either all modules are space switches without memory (bufferless), or employ shared memory modules in the first and third stages (buffered). The former is also referred to as the space-space-space (S<sup>3</sup>) Clos network switch, while the latter is referred to as the memory-space-memory (MSM) Clos network switch. We provide a survey of recent literature concerning switching schemes in the S<sup>3</sup> Clos network switch. The switching problem in the S<sup>3</sup> Clos network switch can be divided into two major parts, namely port-to-port matching (scheduling) and route assignment between the first and third stages. Traditionally, researchers have proposed algorithms to solve these issues separately. Recently, a new class of switching algorithms, called matching algorithms for Clos (MAC), has been proposed to solve scheduling and route assignment simultaneously. We focus on the MAC schemes and show that the new class of algorithms can achieve high performance and maintain good scalability.",

   "abstract": "This article describes two optical devices based on linear arrays of micromirrors. The first is a phased array of micromirrors that can be rotated as well as translated vertically to maintain coherence across the array. We demonstrate experimentally that such micromirrors are capable of high-diffraction-efficiency phased-array scanning of laser beams. The second device is a Gires-Tournois (1969) interferometer with a micromirror array that provides tunable phase modulation for the multitude of partially reflected beams within the interferometer. We demonstrate experimentally that the MEMS-GT interferometer can operate as a tunable deinterleaver for dense wavelength-division multiplexed fiber optic communication.",

For this purpose, the channel characteristics are described and a channel model is presented. This model is related to the physical nature of common indoor power lines, so its parameters can be defined in a straightforward way. Based on it, the performance of communication systems that use discrete multitone modulation, which appears to be the most suitable technique for these channels, is evaluated. Finally, a discussion about medium access control strategies is included.",

Asymptotic limits on jitter tolerance are derived assuming ideal phase detection based on a priori statistics of the received signal, proving that the coarse timing resolution of blind oversampling CDR relies on a phase detection algorithm that makes good estimates of the signal's statistics with a finite number of discrete samples and at reasonable hardware costs. The statistical simulation methodology outlined here enables quick verification of the bit error rate and comparisons between the jitter tolerances of various blind oversampling CDR architectures.",

   "abstract": "A three-stage Clos switch architecture is attractive because of its scalability. From an implementation point of view, it allows us to relax the cooling limitation, but there is a problem interconnecting different stages. This article presents a three-stage switching system that uses optical WDM grouped links and dynamic bandwidth sharing. We call it a WDM grouped-link switch. The introduction of WDM makes the number of cables used in the system proportional to the switch size. Dynamic bandwidth sharing among WDM grouped links prevents the statistical multiplexing gain offered by WDM from falling even if the switching system becomes large. The WDM grouped-link switch uses cell-by-cell wavelength routing. A performance evaluation confirms the scalability and cost-effectiveness of this switch. An implementation of the WDM grouped link and a compact planar lightwave circuit platform is described. This architecture allows us to expand the throughput of the switching system up to 5 Tb/s.",

   "abstract": "We identify some of the key problems that may be encountered when designing a broadband multiple access system with bandwidth on the order of tens or even hundreds of megahertz. We commence with a comparative discussion in terms of the characteristics of three typical code-division multiple access schemes: single-carrier direct-sequence CDMA (SC DS-CDMA), multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), and multicarrier DS-CDMA (MC DS-CDMA). Specifically, their benefits and deficiencies are analyzed when aiming to support ubiquitous communications over a variety of channels encountered in indoor, open rural, suburban, and urban environments. It is shown that when communicating in such diverse environments, both SC DS-CDMA and MC-CDMA exhibit certain limitations that are hard to circumvent. By contrast, when appropriately selecting the system parameters and using transmit diversity, MC DS-CDMA becomes capable of adapting to such diverse propagation environments at a reasonable detection complexity.",

   "abstract": "Content distribution in general, and multicasting in particular, over a wired network to static hosts can be realized by placing proxies and gateways at several parts of the network. However, if the end hosts are mobile over heterogeneous wireless access networks, one needs to consider many operational issues such as network detection, handoff, join and leave latency, and desired level of quality of service, as well as caching and load balancing. This article surveys a set of protocols and technologies that offer multicast-based services for streaming multimedia in a mobile environment. It also brings forth some of the issues related to mobile content distribution in the wireless Internet that may be helpful during its deployment by application service providers.",

In view of this role, the area of multiple antenna communication systems is in the forefront of wireless research. This article reviews two key related aspects of multiple antenna communication systems: multiple access interference mitigation at the receiver via multi-user beamforming; and space-time modulation and coding for MIMO systems. It is shown that both multi-user and MIMO receivers share similar signal processing and complexity tradeoffs.. Following that, a general unified framework for assessing different types of space-time modulation for MIMO systems is introduced. These space-time modulation methods are then compared in terms of Shannon capacity over multipath channels. Key MIMO system performance and implementation issues are also highlighted.",

The basic principles and characteristics of MSM techniques in optical wireless communications are presented. MSM optical wireless systems are explained where some block codes that convert information bits to be transmitted to the symbol amplitudes of subcarriers are used to increase the minimum value of the MS electrical waveform. MSM optical communications systems using subcarrier signal point sequences (SSPS) that can improve the power efficiency of MSM systems are also explained. The performance of MSM optical communications systems is presented in the intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) channel without dispersion and in atmospheric optical communications where the effects of scintillation exist.",

   "abstract": "Clos networks are a class of multistage switching network topologies that provide alternate paths between inputs and outputs, making it possible to minimize or eliminate the blocking that can otherwise occur in such networks. In his seminal paper in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1953, Charles Clos showed how these networks could be configured to make them nonblocking and effectively launched the systematic study of switching system performance, a field that has developed a rich technical literature, and continues to be very active and of continuing practical importance. This article describes how Clos' results have been generalized to systems that support connections with varying bandwidth requirements. These generalizations have extended the application of Clos networks well beyond their original technological context and have led to a number of interesting new results, especially in connection with systems that support multicast communication.",

   "abstract": "In this opinion article, we see digital multimedia communications of the future dependent on business vision, evolving networking and consumer electronics technologies, and public policies regarding intellectual property and investment in communications infrastructure. As always, it is easy to predict a rich networked multimedia future, but difficult to say when or exactly how. These will be determined by social and business understandings on the divisive issues, by still uncertain consumer tastes and willingness to pay, and by resolving some technical obstacles. This brief article gives our personal perspectives on the current status of networked multimedia, the most promising multimedia applications, and the social and technical bottlenecks.",

   "abstract": "In this article we discuss the role of the next-generation optical networks and introduce enabling technologies that support network evolution. The role of networks is undergoing change and is becoming a platform for value creation. In addition to providing new services, networks have to accommodate steady traffic growth and guarantee profitability. We envision a next-generation optical network as the combination of an all-optical core and an adaptive shell operated by intelligent control and management software suites. Possible technological innovations are introduced in devices, transmission technologies, nodes, and networking software, which will contribute to attain a flexible and cost-effective next-generation optical network. New values will be created by the new services provided through these networks, which will change the ways we do businesses and go about our private lives.",

   "abstract": "Storage technology has enjoyed considerable growth since the first disk drive was introduced nearly 50 years ago, in part facilitated by the slow and steady evolution of storage interfaces (SCSI and ATA/IDE). The stability of these interfaces has allowed continual advances in both storage devices and applications, without frequent changes to the standards. However, the interface ultimately determines the functionality supported by the devices, and current interfaces are holding system designers back. Storage technology has progressed to the point that a change in the device interface is needed. Object-based storage is an emerging standard designed to address this problem. In this article we describe object-based storage, stressing how it improves data sharing, security, and device intelligence. We also discuss some industry applications of object-based storage and academic research using objects as a foundation for building even more intelligent storage systems.",

   "abstract": "Many corporate networks use the Internet as a cost-effective substitute for expensive leased lines and long-distance telephone calls, for allowing their users to have on-demand connectivity into their intranets through ad hoc tunnels, a concept known as access VPN. Establishing an access VPN in a broadband access network is very often a difficult networking challenge that requires several tunnels to be established between the various involved entities. This is especially the case in an open broadband access network where the association between a host and its ISP is not known to the network in advance. This article discusses several schemes for establishing an access VPN in a broadband access network, and explains the need for the various tunnels in each scheme.",

In particular, we show that the requirement of providing agility at the optical layer in the face of traffic forecast uncertainties is served better through photonic switching. On the other hand, some of the network-level functions, such as fast protection, subwavelength aggregation, and flexible client connectivity, require electrical switching. We further argue that additional values are achieved with hybrid photonic and electrical switching, which do not exist when either of these options is used in isolation.",

We first discuss the changes that have occurred in optical networking in general and the implications for protection. We then discuss scenarios where optical protection makes sense, recognizing that other fast protection schemes at the client layer provide viable alternatives in certain cases. Our conclusion is that optical protection makes sense for metro networks, as long as they are based on simple dedicated schemes. When it gets to more complex shared ring and mesh protection, we believe that OEO-based schemes are more viable, whether crossconnect-based or packet-switch-based.",

   "abstract": "Optical switching technologies are very crucial to future mobile broadband all-optical IP networks. Many different optical switching technologies are currently available or under development. The main purpose of the article is to conduct performance comparisons on optical switching technologies in terms of basic performance, network requirements, and system requirements based on a literature survey. The technologies include switching based on optical microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), thermal optical switching, electro-optic switching, and acousto-optic switching technologies. Each optical switching technology has unique performance characteristics specific to the utilized optical phenomena. It might be crucial to integrate some technologies together to achieve a better solution for optical switching. Optical switching is a very hot topic attracting much research effort. Optical MEMS-based switching technology might be one of the most promising approaches at present. Many new optical switching technologies might be created in the near future. Through the impact of nanotechnology, some innovative approaches to optical switching might emerge.",

   "abstract": "We describe a deterministic protocol for routing delay and loss-sensitive traffic through an IP network. Unlike traditional approaches, the method described here - packet sequencing - does not rely on queue management. Instead, it uses a temporally-based deterministic protocol to coordinate and switch IP packets on a systemwide basis. As a result, end-to-end throughput is guaranteed, without packet loss, loss variance, or accumulated performance impairment; additionally, end-to-end delay is minimized, and jitter is essentially eliminated. We also show that packet sequencing can complement conventional IP networks: sequencing does not negate the use of queue management QoS methods that are the subject of considerable ongoing study. This article describes the fundamental approach, issues associated with scalability, illustrative performance in the context of storage networking, and attributes related to the security and reliability of IP networks.",

   "abstract": "We examine the status of enterprise-class server clusters and the communication issues that need to be addressed in future systems. With increasing system performance, new approaches beyond traditional copper-only communication solutions have to be examined. Parallel optics is an attractive solution to overcome copper's shortcomings, but traditional approaches to parallel optics have had their own limitations. We describe a new approach to parallel optics - dense parallel optics - and its relevance to enterprise servers. After discussing system communication needs, we examine dense parallel optics from both the passive cabling and active component views. We explain how dense parallel optics offers a unique way to address the performance, cost, reliability, and scalability of server systems. We also discuss how current approaches to dense parallel optics afford system opportunities beyond simple data transport.",

   "abstract": "Background noise and multipath propagation are the major impairments in indoor optical wireless links. They can introduce heavy distortion in the received optical signal and can degrade the system performance. An investigation into the optical wireless system performance has been carried out for two configurations: a hybrid system, and a diffuse system with a single detector and a triangular pyramidal fly-eye diversity receiver (PFDR). Original results for both systems that employ a PFDR antenna, under different fields of view (FOVs), are presented. The design goal is to reduce the effect of signal spread and improve the signal-to-noise ratio when the system operates under the constraints of background noise and multipath dispersion. It is demonstrated that through PFDR FOV optimization the directional background interference can be reduced and the received pulse shape improved.",

   "abstract": "iISCSI is emerging as an end-to-end protocol for transporting storage I/O block data over IP networks. By exploiting the ubiquitous Internet infrastructure, iSCSI greatly facilitates remote storage, remote backup, and data mirroring. This article evaluates the performance of two typical iSCSI storage subsystems by measuring and analyzing block-level I/O access performance and file-level access performance. In the file-level performance study, we compare file access performance in an NAS scheme with that in an iSCSI-based SAN scheme. Our test results show that Gigabit Ethernet-based iSCSI can reach very high bandwidth, close to that of a direct FC disk access in block I/O access. However, when the iSCSI traverses through longer distance, throughput relies heavily on the available bandwidth between the initiator and the target. On the other hand, the file-level performance shows that iSCSI-based file access (SAN scheme) provides higher performance than using NFS protocol in Linux and SMB protocol in Windows (NAS scheme). However, the advantage of using iSCSI-based file accesses decreases as the file size increases. The obtained experimental results shed some light on the performance of applications based on iSCSI storage.",

   "abstract": "The paper presents a new architecture, called photonic burst switching (PBS), with variable time slot provisioning, supporting high-speed bursty data transmission within hop and span-constrained networks. First, the edge and switching node architecture for in-band and out-of-band signaling is defined with optical switch fabric performance parameters. Second, the edge router regions of operation for burst assembly are studied via simulations. Third, we introduce: (i) a GMPLS-based PBS software architecture in terms of control and data plane operations that is extended to enable the PBS optical interfaces with software building blocks for edge and switching nodes; (ii) an adaptive PBS MAC layer functionality and framing of multiple generic payloads. The integration of the proposed PBS network architecture with low-cost optical switching fabrics and GMPLS-based software architecture should provide the means for robust and efficient optical transport of bandwidth-demanding applications within enterprise networks.",

The characteristics of the power line channel are investigated, and the causes of electromagnetic interference from PLC technology in wireless communications services are discussed. Since the radiation originating from PLC cannot be avoided completely by technical means, a solution via standardization is necessary. The current status of worldwide regulation concerning EMC is presented.",

   "abstract": "Integrating appliances in the home through a wired network often proves to be impractical: routing cables is usually difficult, changing the network structure afterward even more so, and portable devices can only be connected at fixed connection points. Wireless networks are not the answer either: batteries have to be regularly replaced or changed, and what they add to the device's size and weight might be disproportionate for smaller appliances. In Pin&amp;Play, we explore a design space in between typical wired and wireless networks, investigating the use of surfaces to network objects that are attached to it. This article gives an overview of the network model, and describes functioning prototypes that were built as a proof of concept.",

   "abstract": "Strong demands for public wireless broadband services will require more capacity than even that can be,supplied by advanced mobile cellular systems like the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System. The increasing popularity of WLANs has prompted mobile network operators to consider their deployment in high-density usage areas like indoor/outdoor public hotspots to provide complementary broadband access to their UMTS networks. In order to provide consistent QoS control over an integrated UMTS and WLAN system, a policy-based multidomain QoS management architecture is proposed in this article. Different UMTS-WLAN interworking scenarios are discussed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.",

Due to their high complexity and very low accessibility, built-in self-test (BIST) is the most common solution implemented to test the different memories embedded in the system. This article presents a programmable BIST architecture based on a single microprogrammable BIST processor and a set of memory wrappers designed to simplify the test of a system containing a large number of distributed multiport memories of different sizes (number of bits, number of words), access protocols (asynchronous, synchronous), and timing.",

Although the realization of long-wavelength VCSELs was once considered nearly impossible, the progress of the field during the last three to four years has been tremendous, in part due to the abundance in funding. Although at the present time it is difficult to forecast the market, we believe the technical ground for potential applications of long-wavelength VCSELs is sound.

   "abstract": "Due to the explosive growth of data-related traffic driven by the Internet, network reliability becomes an important issue. We investigate various protection approaches to handle failures for dynamic traffic demands in IP/MPLS-over-WDM networks. An LSP can be protected at either the IP/MPLS layer or the optical layer. In IP/MPLS layer protection, an LSP is protected by providing a link-disjoint backup LSP between its end nodes. In optical layer protection, an LSP is protected by the backup lightpath of each lightpath traversed by the LSP. We present two integrated routing algorithms: hop-based integrated routing algorithm and bandwidth-based integrated routing algorithm (BIRA) to set up the restorable bandwidth-guaranteed paths efficiently. Then we present a multilayer protection scheme for multiclass traffic in such networks. This scheme takes into account the different QoS and recovery requirements of the traffic to provide protection capability either at the MPLS layer or at the optical layer in a cost-effective manner. We use the connection blocking probability and number of optical-electrical-optical conversions as performance metrics to compare various protection approaches.",

   "abstract": "The next generation of mobile systems is expected to support multiple radio access technologies, as well as diverse types of terminals, including mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and laptops, as well as personal area, moving, and sensor networks. Thus, future wireless systems will not only continue to break technological barriers in terms of new air interface capabilities, higher bit rates, mobility, security, and QoS management, but will present new end-to-end scenarios in which applications access services over multiple L2 hops and multiple IP networks. The term always best connected refers to the concept of defining a set of access selection criteria and mechanisms that allow users to get connected to various services in a nearly optimal manner. Providing QoS in this type of heterogeneous multihop environment is a challenging task because applications may be completely unaware of them scenario and the underlying layer 2 technologies that can be quite different at different hops. For instance, some wireless links may have scarce resources and highly optimized QoS mechanisms; others may not support explicit QoS handling at all. In this article we consider the use of IP-level QoS signaling as a key component to support the end-to-end QoS for various applications. We propose a small set of application programmer- and wirelesslink-friendly IP QoS parameters (wireless hints) and illustrate the use of these in a specific WLAN-to-cellular handover situation. We conclude that the proposed model, signaling protocol, and wireless information elements can efficiently support QoS in heterogeneous mobile environments.",

RRM functions impact the overall system efficiency and the operator infrastructure cost, so they will definitively play an important role in a mature 3G scenario. In order to provide some insight into radio resource management (RRM) strategies implementation, a range of representative case-studies with several innovative algorithms are presented and supported by simulation results in a realistic UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network scenario as devised in the 3GGP standardization forum. In particular, a decentralized uplink transmission rate selection algorithm in the short term, a congestion control mechanism to cope with overload situations, and downlink scheduling for layered streaming video packets are proposed.",

   "abstract": "This article discusses a particular alternative to the long-term BER test and is an attempt to stimulate debate about the value of this alternative method until an accurate universally acceptable option is developed. Understandably, telecommunications industry players want an acceptable method that can determine error ratios faster than the traditional BER test can. One alternative to emerge thus far is quality factor, or \"Q factor,\" testing, which basically can be used to calculate the theoretical BER of a transmission system. This \"quick and dirty\" test in fact provides a small incremental benefit in that it saves time. However, some network operators and network equipment manufacturer (NEM) installers are discovering that Q factor, for a variety of technical reasons discussed, can be an inconclusive measurement of BER. Consequently, some who use Q factor testing may base their operational decisions and hence their competitive position in the market on misleading assumptions.",

   "abstract": "A survey of MPLS protection methods and their utilization in combination with online routing methods is presented in this article. Usually, fault management methods pre-establish backup paths to recover traffic after a failure. In addition, MPLS allows the creation of different backup types, and hence MPLS is a suitable method to support traffic-engineered networks. In this article, an introduction of several label switch path backup types and their pros and cons are pointed out. The creation of an LSP involves a routing phase, which should include QoS aspects. In a similar way, to achieve a reliable network the LSP backups must also be routed by a QoS routing method. When LSP creation requests arrive one by one (a dynamic network scenario), online routing methods are applied. The relationship between MPLS fault management and QoS online routing methods is unavoidable, in particular during the creation of LSP backups. Both aspects are discussed in this article. Several ideas on how these actual technologies could be applied together are presented and compared.",

One solution is to predict the trajectory of mobile terminals so as to perform resource reservations in advance. With the vision that future mobile devices are likely to be equipped with reasonably accurate positioning capability, we investigate how this new feature may be used for mobility predictions. We propose a mobility prediction technique that incorporates road topology information, and describe its use for dynamic resource reservation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the improvement in reservation efficiency compared with several other schemes.",

   "abstract": "As networking technologies penetrate wide varieties of devices for daily usage, home networks are becoming a reality. The bandwidth and always-on connectivity provided by the rapidly growing broadband technologies, such as cable and digital subscriber line (DSL), render home networking even more attractive. A residential gateway is a device that interconnects various home devices to one another as well as to the Internet. The home networks being deployed today are simple and inexpensive with the residential gateway providing only connectivity. As home networks evolve and become more widespread, emerging applications on home networks will demand additional features that require quality of service. We present an architecture of a next-generation QoS-enabled residential gateway. Such a residential gateway, in conjunction with the developments in QoS-enabled wireless LAN technologies, will usher in a new generation of home networks that are capable of supporting a wide range of applications.",

   "abstract": "The mobile IP protocol has evolved from providing mobility support for portable computers to support for wireless handheld devices with high mobility patterns. A new category of micromobility protocols has been proposed to deal with the increased signaling loads that will be generated with large populations of such devices on a network. We argue that the authentication schemes presently employed in these networks do not scale well for large numbers of nodes, and that the lack of accounting procedures prevents the mass deployment of these networks. We envisage that future access networks will be operated by independent service providers, who will charge users for access to services in the fixed network but may not have long-term contractual relationships with them. These access networks may also employ a variety of micromobility protocols for fast handover support. We present a scheme based on hash chains, which allows for fast authentication of datagrams for secure updating of router entries within the access network, and real-time accounting of network usage by mobile nodes. Such a system will alleviate problems of fraud in mobile networks and eliminate the need for interoperator billing agreements.",

   "abstract": "Blocking has been the key performance index in the design of an all-optical network. Existing research demonstrates that an effective routing and wavelength assignment strategy and a proper wavelength converter placement algorithm are the two primary vehicles for improving the blocking performance. However, these two issues have largely been investigated separately in that the existing RWA algorithms have seldom considered the presence of wavelength conversion, while the wavelength converter placement algorithms have largely assumed that a static routing and random wavelength assignment algorithm is employed. The main objective of this article is to present some strong evidence that these two issues need to be considered jointly, and call for the reexamination of both RWA and wavelength converter placement.",

   "abstract": "GMPLS-based labeled optical burst switching (LOBS) networks are being considered as the next-generation optical Internet. GMPLS includes wavelength switching next to label and fiber (space) switching. We present a new concept of optically labeling bursts of packets suitable for LOBS networks supported by GMPLS. It is based on angle modulation, which enables control information to modulate the phase or frequency of the optical carrier, while payload data are transmitted via intensity modulation (IM). In particular, the optical label is orthogonally modulated, with respect to the payload, using either frequency shift keying or differential phase shift keying. We present a performance analysis of the modulation schemes by means of simulations where the influence of the payload IM extinction ratio and laser linewidth are investigated. In addition, the transmission performance of an IM/FSK combined modulated signal is experimentally validated at 10 Gb/s, demonstrating at the same time an FSK label swapping operation. Finally, a suitable optical label-controlled switch design is proposed that takes advantage of these novel labeling techniques, and efficiently combines widely tunable, fast switching lasers and SOA-MZI wavelength converters with an arrayed waveguide grating router.",

   "abstract": "During the last decade, two big efforts on Internet quality of service were made. The first, IntServ, promises precise per-flow service provisioning but never really made it as a commercial end-user product, which was mainly accredited to its lack of scalability. Its successor, DiffServ, is more scalable at the cost of coarser service granularity - which may be the reason why it is not yet commercially available to end users either. This leaves us with the question: is there a fundamental trade-off between QoS and scalability? A trade-off that, in the long run, could prevent deployment of QoS for end users altogether?.",

From the user's perspective, response time is a factor that could impact the acceptability of electronic commerce. This article is concerned with system architectures for online stores. Emphasis is placed on techniques to improve a system's capacity to support more users without suffering a noticeable degradation in response time performance. Such techniques have been investigated as part of a Canadian Institute for Telecommunications Research major project entitled Enabling Technology for Electronic Commerce Applications, developed in close collaboration with the IBM/sup /spl reg// Centre for Advanced Studies. The basic architecture of a Web-based electronic commerce system is first described along with the types of data that need to be managed. Next, an overview of existing techniques for improving system capacity is presented. Finally, highlights of research results obtained as part of the CITR electronic commerce major project are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The recommended policy-based management system by the IETF is a two-tiered architectural design. It exhibits several observable fundamental limitations, for example, system scalability and cross-vendor hardware compatibility problems. In this article, a multitiered architecture, the unified policy-based management system, is proposed. The middle-tier agents, introduced between policy managers and network routers, offer flexibility and scalability to the design. A dynamic unified information model can be achieved between the policy decision and enforcement points of the system by properly extending network protocols, by installing or removing hardware interpretation modules on the fly, and by interpreting and translating request/decision messages at the agents. To complete the UPM design, novel load sharing and balancing communication protocols are implemented to improve system scalability. The system performances of the UPM are compared to the recommended PBM system of the IETF through extensive experiments. The results indicate that the UPM is a high-performance and scalable policy-based management design.",

   "abstract": "Storage area networks offer high availability, reliability, and scalability, and are a promising solution for large-scale storage needs of many enterprises. As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for SANs is to provide secure storage, which implies data integrity and data confidentiality. In this article we propose a solution that addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose a novel security architecture for SAN that uses a secure group communication protocol to provide efficient group keying without involving any centralized servers. This fosters both scalability and fault tolerance.",

On the other hand, WLAN systems already offer bit rates surpassing those of 3G systems, but are often found lacking with respect to roaming and mobility support. In short, WLAN systems are great for hot spot coverage, while 3G systems provide global coverage and the necessary network and management infrastructure to cater for security, roaming, and charging requirements.

The following article explains the concept of dynamic planning and highlights the challenges involved. A system architecture that allows networks to be self-organizing is presented, and the concept of situation awareness is introduced. The resulting functionality endows network elements with the intelligence to react dynamically to perturbations. Location-aided planning is currently receiving much attention from the research community; its application to situation awareness is discussed. The use of game theory to solve resource contention in competitive scenarios is highly effective. Adaptors that are specific program modules are used to launch countermeasures and are demonstrated in this article through an example. A number of key results associated with the concept of reconfigurability are presented. Finally, a new planning paradigm based on local interaction is introduced and relevant conclusions are drawn.",

   "abstract": "Synthetic or active measurements are often used to characterize IP performance; however, it is rare to find them used to resolve problems in an operational setting. We show that the active monitoring system in the AT&amp;T IP backbone provide's a comprehensive view of network performance that is complementary to traditional element level monitoring, making it an integral part of network management. This paper discusses the design and implementation of these active measurements in the network. We continuously monitor \"path-level\" performance metrics such as round-trip delay, loss, jitter, and reordering events to proactively detect impairments. Our system relies on the promotion of key metrics to the operational displays, while maintaining a rich set of statistics for analyzing rare and unforeseen events. This timely information enables us to react,quickly to performance degradation, avoiding any sustained effect on customer applications. The results also help us understand the network's ability to support time-sensitive application performance. Selected \"interesting\" events observed are presented, including detection of degradation caused by low-level bit errors on a physical link, detection of route changes on the network and their impact on real-time applications, and finally detection of reordering caused by forwarding loops.",

   "abstract": "Current RFIC test practices perform system-level verification through specific functional validation. Structural testing, although widely accepted for digital and analog generic ICs, is not adopted in this domain due to the lack of appropriate fault models. Another important reason is the impossibility of embedding test-mode circuitry within the RF blocks because of parasitic component disturbances. This work discusses the feasibility of complementing functional tests with structural methods by using thermal testing. The benefits reside in the intrinsic electrical loadless property of the technique and the impact of many defects on the circuit temperature. The analysis focuses on the possibilities of detecting defects that escape functional testing, and practical implementation issues.",

   "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, which have attracted public attention, involve a number of directly connected \"peers\" exchanging various types of information among themselves. However, applications based on P2P systems generally generate a lot of traffic and require not only the resources of every peer (e.g., CPU, memory, and bandwidth) but also many network resources. We think the main problems of P2P systems can be solved using IP multicasting, which is becoming popular as an effective way to transfer streaming media over the network and can reduce network traffic and the load on a streaming server. We propose applying IP multicasting to P2P systems. After mentioning that almost every application can be improved by our proposal, we discuss which routing protocol is suitable. Finally, we show that we can get good results even when part of the network does not support IP multicasting.",

We explain how it will support real-time IP multimedia services, as these services are expected to drive the adoption of wireless all-IP networks. We not only focus on the centerpiece of IP multimedia support, the IP multimedia subsystem, but also include the GPRS transport capabilities and OSA middleware capabilities.

   "abstract": "With the advent of WDM technology, IP backbone carriers are now connecting core routers directly over point-to-point WDM links (IP over WDM). The advances and standardization in optical control plane technologies like GMPLS have substantially increased the intelligence of the optical layer and shown promise toward making dynamic provisioning and restoration of optical layer circuits a basic capability to be leveraged by upper network layers. In light of this, an architecture where a reconfigurable optical backbone (IP over OTN) consisting of SONET/SDH crossconnects/switches interconnected via DWDM links provides connectivity among IP routers is an emerging alternative. As carriers evolve their networks to meet the continued growth of data traffic in the Internet, they have to make a fundamental choice between the above architectural alternatives. In the current business environment, this decision is likely to be guided by network cost and scalability concerns. A reconfigurable optical backbone provides a flexible transport infrastructure that eases many operational hurdles, such as fast provisioning, robust restoration, and disaster recovery. It can also be shared with other service networks such as ATM, frame relay, and SONET/SDH. From that perspective, an agile transport infrastructure is definitely the architecture of choice. The IP-over-OTN solution is also more scalable since the core of the network in this architecture is based on more scalable optical switches rather than IP routers. But what about cost? Since the IP-over-OTN solution introduces a new network element, the optical switch, is it more expensive? We address that question by comparing IP-over-WDM and IP-over-OTN architectures from an economic standpoint using real-life network data. We show that contrary to common wisdom, IP over OTN can lead to substantial reduction in capital expenditure through reduction of expensive transit IP router ports. The savings increases rapidly with the number of nodes in the network and traffic demand between nodes. The economies of scale for the IP-over-OTN backbone increase substantially when we move traffic restoration from the IP layer to the optical layer. We also compare the two architectures from the perspective of scalability, flexibility, and robustness. Our observations make a strong case in favor of a switched optical backbone for building scalable IP networks.",

   "abstract": "This article surveys approaches to teleconferencing in voice over IP networks. The considerations for conferencing include perceived quality, scalability, control, and compatibility. Architectures used for conferencing range from centralized bridges to full mesh. Centralized conference bridges used with compressed speech degrade speech quality when multiple talkers are mixed and subjected to tandem coding operations. Full mesh and multicast solutions (mixing at the end-points) are inappropriate when the number of conferees is large. This article discusses a hybrid solution that incorporates tandem-free bridging (the bridge selects and forwards packets) and endpoint mixing.",

   "abstract": "Long-reach DSL (LDSL) is a project in the ITU, with the objective to increase the reach of DSL solutions. Range extended ADSL (READ-SL) is the first step in the LDSL project, driven primarily by requirements for North America. READSL extends the connectivity of G.992.1/G.992.3 based ADSL up to 18 kft, increasing the ADSL reach by more than 3 kft under the severe crosstalk conditions typically experienced in the North American access network. To cope with the multiple physical layer field conditions, READSL uses \"smart\" DSL technology based on a selectable mask procedure. READSL is spectrally compatible with the basis systems in the North American Spectrum Management Standard T1.417, and requires minimum changes to both the G.992.1/G.992.3 standards and product platforms. This article reviews READSL as a subset of the LDSL project.",

   "abstract": "When ITU-T standardized SONET/SDH in 1988, the highest speed was 156 Mb/s. The rapid growth of the Internet, as well as other factors, has increased the necessary speed of today's networks to 10 Gb/s or 40 Gb/s (10G, 40G). In 2000, ITU-T Recommendation G.783 specified the maximum jitter for error-free communications on 10G and 40G networks, but there was not a standard process to verify the accuracy of jitter measurements and no reference source with a known jitter amount. Accurate jitter measurements at high speed are difficult because of the small times involved, but they are essential for implementing error-free networks. The paper describes a method which shows that accurate jitter measurements at 10G and above must correctly account for both pattern-dependent and random jitter. Pattern-dependent jitter is caused to a much greater extent by the transmitter than by the receiver. Incorrect assumptions about the source of pattern-dependent jitter can result in large inconsistencies in jitter measurements at high speed. The method outlined solves those problems.",

   "abstract": "A summary of research on survivable IP networks overlaid over WDM networks is presented. The WDM networks are part of optical transport service providers, who lease lightpath services to institutions with IP networks. The lightpath services realize IP links for IP networks, and they have different protection grades such as unprotected and protected. The research included considering new network survivability requirements and incorporating them into network design problems. The cost of survivable IP over WDM networks is compared over three scenarios. Each succeeding scenario has the WDM network provide more flexible services, and the IP and WDM networks become more integrated. We consider the problem of setting up lightpaths for an IP network so that the network will remain connected after a fiber link fault. Algorithms to find the lightpaths and minimize cost are given. The network costs under the three scenarios are compared by simulations.",

User data represent all information describing the network and personalized service environments related to a roaming user. After analyzing user data accessed by identified VHE functions and roles, a modular and flexible information model called a user profile has been designed. Various architecture scenarios are then addressed for the implementation of this user profile. Among them, the best one fits the needs and constraints due to existing network architectures, and eventually provides a global federating solution for VHE management.",

In order to provision the equivalent quality of service of legacy connection-oriented layer 2 virtual private networks (VPNs), IP VPNs have to overcome the intrinsically best effort characteristics of the Internet in this multimedia era. This article discusses the IP VPN quality of service (QoS) issue from a service provider point of view, where QoS guarantees are carried out at the network level as well as at the node level. It presents the whole picture by highlighting and stitching together various QoS enabling technologies from previous research and engineering work.",

   "abstract": "In the past decade, there have been numerous efforts in ubiquitous. computing. For home networks, we believe that ubiquitous computing requires a global-scale system that is securable, administered by, multiple independent nonspecialist administrators, and integrates off-the-shelf hardware and software. In this system every home owner acts as an administrator of the network in the home. We are developing such a system based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), with Bluetooth devices for location sensing and the Service Location Protocol (SLP) for service discovery. We also introduce context-aware location information to augment device discovery bind user communication. The system builds on our CINEMA infrastructure.",

   "abstract": "An unprecedented transformation in the design, deployment, and application of short-range wireless devices and services is in progress today. This trend is in line with the imminent transition from third- to fourth-generation radio systems, where heterogeneous environments are expected to prevail eventually. A key driver in this transition is the steep growth in both demand and deployment of WLANs/WPANs based on the wireless standards within the IEEE 802 suite. Today, these short-range devices and networks operate mainly standalone in indoor home and office environments or large enclosed public areas, while their integration into the wireless wide-area infrastructure is still nearly nonexistent and far from trivial. This status quo in the short-range wireless application space is about to be disrupted by novel devices and systems based on the emerging UWB radio technology with the potential to provide solutions for many of today's problems in the areas of spectrum management and radio system engineering. The approach employed by UWB radio devices is based on sharing already occupied spectrum resources by means of the overlay principle, rather than looking for still available but possibly unsuitable new bands. This novel radio technology has received legal adoption by the regulatory authorities in the United States, and efforts to achieve this status in Europe and Asia are underway. This article discusses both the application potential and technical challenges presented by UWB radio as an unconventional but promising new wireless technology.",

The emphasis has been on the profitable use of software and DSP tools for the purpose of demonstrating adaptivity and reconfigurability features, primarily for the lower layers (i.e., PHY and DLC/MAC layers). The topics covered briefly herein include the meaning of the terms in the present context, their instantiation in the design, their contribution to an optimized low-transmit-power scheme, the novel elements required in order to achieve it, the contribution to a guaranteed QoS philosophy, and the relationship of the testbed to broader software-defined-radio concepts.",

   "abstract": "The rapid advances in dense wavelength-division multiplexing technology with hundreds of wavelengths per fiber and worldwide fiber deployment have brought about a tremendous increase in the size (i.e., number of ports) of photonic cross-connects, as well as in the cost and difficulty associated with controlling such large cross-connects. Waveband switching (WBS) has attracted attention for its practical importance in reducing the port count, associated control complexity, and cost of photonic cross-connects. We show that WBS is different from traditional wavelength routing, and thus techniques developed for wavelength-routed networks (including, for example, those for traffic grooming) cannot be directly applied to effectively address WBS-related problems. We describe two multigranular OXC architectures for WBS. By using the multilayer MG-OXC in conjunction with intelligent WBS algorithms for both static and dynamic traffic, we show that one can achieve considerable savings in the port count. We also present various WBS schemes and lightpath grouping strategies, and discuss issues related to waveband conversion and failure recovery in WBS networks.",

This has created the need to provide advance Internet services to mobile users without causing service failures due to connection migration or handoffs. However, scarcity of wireless resources restricts the provision of multimedia services in wireless networks. We address the issue of managing wireless resources to support Web-based multimedia document services including MPEG-4-based applications, in wireless networks with a high degree of user mobility. In particular, we formulate the resource management problem in wireless networks as an optimization problem with an objective function comprising different quality of presentation parameters.",
