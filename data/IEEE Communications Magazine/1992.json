   "abstract": "It is argued that building a national or regional information infrastructure is simply the entry fee for participation in the global economy and the information society of the 21st century. It is not enough for a nation's leading companies to participate by building their own private information networks. First-rank nations will see to it that homes, schools, and small businesses as well as large corporations have access to the global information system. The author discusses his vision of global information networking and the infrastructure needed to support his vision. The global information network would support personal nomadic information access and communications, information malls, and enterprise integration.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The possible applications and support systems for such a terminal are outlined.

It is argued that optimizing performance in each of these areas is crucial in meeting the performance requirements of the overall system and providing a small, lightweight terminal for personal communications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is shown that this architecture is capable of fast but stable online recognition learning, hypothesis testing and adaptive naming in response to an arbitrary stream of analog or binary input patterns. The fuzzy ARTMAP neural network combines a unique set of computational abilities that are needed to function autonomously in a changing world and that alternative models have not yet achieved. In particular, fuzzy ARTMAP can autonomously learn, recognize, and make predictions about rare events, large nonstationary databases, morphologically variable types of events, and many-to-one and one-to-many relationships. The system's fast learning of rare events and error-based learning and alternatives are described, and uses for ART systems and the development of unsupervised ART systems are reviewed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The results obtained suggest that reference models for generalized hypertext systems, commonly called hypermedia systems, may be more readily formulated within the object-oriented system paradigm than other approaches currently under consideration for hypertext alone. The development of the software architecture for Libernet.91, a system for remote access and control of multimedia source material, is discussed. Concepts of object-oriented database management systems are outlined. The underlying architecture of the implemented system is compared to the Dexter hypertext reference model.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Two-way video offers televisting, tele-education, and telecommuting services, which together could represent a further substantial bandwidth demand. High-speed data services to provide the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) between locations, or even operate a computer-aided design (CAD) terminal remotely from its local area network (LAN), are likely new applications for broadband integrated services digital networks (B-ISDN). The video quality evolution and digital modulation techniques that are making broadband digital delivery of TV signals possible are reviewed. Cable TV B-ISDN delivery, short twisted pair B-ISDN delivery, and TV broadcast digital delivery are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "Frame relay is a standardized interface that provides multiplexed access to bandwidth-on-demand backbone networks and delivers LAN-like performance over a wide area. It is shown that use of frame relay can benefit private networks. The multiplexed physical interface reduces the number of ports required on expensive bridge, router, and controller equipment, as well as the number of expensive communications facilities required to interconnect the bridges, routers, and controllers. Frame relay's data link connection identifier (DLCI) addressing allows a single frame-relay access device to communicate as if directly attached to nearly 1000 other access devices. The bandwidth-on-demand characteristics give end systems and intermediate systems the appearance of having far more bandwidth available than they physically have dedicated, and the optional local management interface (LMI) extensions simplify the configuration and management of frame-relay-based networks. Most important is that the application of frame relay interfaces reduces the latency of private networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is a system consisting of transmission, demultiplexing, and switching components providing an information movement and management (IMM) infrastructure. The networks provide a customized operations environment with predictable service objectives and cost. The market drivers, legislative events, and enabling technologies that have instigated user-operated networks, often making them more advanced than those of the common carriers, are examined. The roles of T-1 multiplexing, corporate data processing, and frame relay services in the growth of private data networks are discussed. Issues driving the evolution of private data communication towards broadband networks are presented. The major trends in the future development of the private data networks are summarized.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "It is shown that multimedia, multipoint conferencing systems create important requirements for the networks they use to transmit information among conference participants. These requirements, which stem from the need for conferencing systems to emulate the richness of control present in face-to-face conversations, may extend from the user interface to the control and coordination of communication networks. The user interface of a conferencing system should present users with the means to control the conduct of meetings, as well as the exchange and presentation of multimedia information. The virtual meeting room metaphor of Rapport, which provides the foundation for this system's user interface, is described. The creation and communication of multimedia information, conferencing over multiple and integrated networks, and requirements for multiport communications are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "A family of applications that consists of interactive multimedia documents, such as electronic magazines and interactive TV shows, is examined and the links between application architecture, user behavior, and network performance are investigated. The kinds of application-specific information that influence the end-to-end quality of service are discussed. The architecture and dynamics of the interactive document in terms of presentation objects (P-Objects), which are the segments of information accessed by the application and which are described according to their size, media composition, and access links, are described. The same structural characteristics that may make an interactive multimedia document appealing to the end user are the characteristics that are helpful during dynamic network performance optimization. This observation is based on the hypothesis that the P-Objects' access graph, together with viewing time statistics, is the information most useful to the network delivery control mechanism for optimizing network performance. Preliminary guidelines for both network and application designers to address each other's concerns are presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The problem of maintaining continuity of playback of each media stream in the presence of multiple subscriber requests is formulated, and admission control algorithms that permit a multimedia server to satisfy the maximum number of subscribers simultaneously are presented. A feedback technique in which a multimedia service uses lightweight messages called feedback units that are transmitted back to it by subscribers' mediaphones to detect asynchrony among them and steer them back to synchrony thereafter is presented. The feedback technique guarantees synchronous playback of media streams transmitted by the multimedia server to subscribers over metropolitan-area networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The factors effecting education which are specific to that country, including its political situation and the efforts of the academic community during the last several decades to keep in touch with the global flow of people and information, are emphasized. The basic structure of the Polish educational system is discussed and illustrated with several statistics. The decentralization of the academic system is discussed, along with obstacles to further progress. The evolution of curricula for students of telecommunications is analyzed, and the aid of the European Community (EC) in restructuring and modernizing Polish universities is presented.

   "abstract": "The evolution of T1-based private networks is reviewed. It is shown that as a result of bursty data, voice/data segregation, and processor advances, data networks are becoming packet-based. The need for efficient transport of data, and possibly voice, point to a frame-based system with the possibility of eventually moving to a cell-based system. An architecture for supporting connectionless transport over wide-area networks (WANs) may be needed eventually, but for now the connection mode is sufficient. Since virtually all data transport will be protocol-oriented, the need for efficiency at high speeds will supersede the need for the network to guarantee delivery. It is shown that frame relay meets these criteria. As a frame-based, connection-oriented fast-packet technology, it provides the needed functions for emerging corporate networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The main goals of the global corporate networks in the 1980s were twofold: obtaining convenient functions by making up for deficiencies in services offered by telecommunication service providers, and lowering communication costs. It is argued that the strategic importance of network systems to corporations is increasing and that construction of application-oriented global corporate networks will expand in the future. The operation, maintenance, and user base expansion of the global corporate networks are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is argued that economic conditions continue to affect ISDN investment in the USA. Worldwide customer acceptance of ISDN is contrasted with earlier projections and shown to be running at about 25% of earlier projections. IBM's current ISDN product set is discussed briefly. Even though the rollout of services has not yet achieved expectations, IBM believes the potential for ISDN use by customers is significant.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "INS-Net, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's (NTT's) commercial integrated services digital network (ISDN) service, is described. There are two types of INS-Net service. INS-Net 64 provides basic rate interface service, and INS-Net 1500 provides primary rate interface service. The implementation of INS-Net and the promotion, application, and penetration of ISDN services are discussed. It is argued that as the number of useful applications grows, the number of subscribers will rise accordingly, particularly among business users. This increased volume of both applications and users will in turn lead to lower ISDN CPE costs, and will make ISDN an indispensable means to business activities in the 1990s.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

These capabilities could be used as the starting point for an economic analysis of IN implementation costs versus service worth. From a very large target set of call model trigger check points (TCPs), the dozen or so identified in the CCITT Capability Set 1 are shown to be sufficient. The SCP and IP functional entity actions identified are also sufficient to support PCS core network functions.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The key to the success of CS1 lies in it being simple enough to be realizable with limited impact on existing software technology and network signaling, rich enough to provide a nontrivial, commercially deployable, initial set of services, and open-ended for growth, both in terms of service richness and penetration, and new capabilities enabled by new technologies. The objectives of IN and CS1, the main characteristics of CS1, and the framework and directions for IN evolution are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "Following extensive discussion between the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and private industry on competing personal communication system (PCS) technologies and regulatory policies, the FCC took a concrete step to address, in a notice of proposed rulemaking released in February 1992, the most critical issue to PCS development: spectrum allocation. The FCC targeted 220 MHz of spectrum, located between 1.85 and 2.20 GHz, to be reserved for a variety of emerging technologies. Specifically, the FCC proposes to dedicate the 1850-1990, 2110-2150, and 2160-2200 MHz bands to emerging technologies. The proposal also establishes an unprecedented migration plan to encourage the fixed microwave users currently assigned to these bands to relocate to other fixed microwave bands above 3 GHz or to alternative media such as fiber optics or satellites. The events leading to these proposals and the tasks they create for the FCC are outlined.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Open call processing addresses the limitations of the current feature procurement process by being vendor-independent; i.e. the same call processing model is used for all switching systems and it is required that features be independently installable on a running system. A structure for call processing software that supports open call processing is described. Different approaches to managing call processing features are discussed. The implementation of a simulation model of a feature manager that ties 17 interacting features together into a single feature package is presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

NEMACS is capable of applying different NM strategies to a plethora of simulated network scenarios that include networks of differing size, speed, transport topology, control, and management architectures. NEMACS simulates networks by modeling the behavior of various network modules: call transport modules (CTMs), call control modules (CCMs), and network control modules (NCMs). The implementation of NEMACS software and four examples of how NEMACS has been used to rapidly prototype NM techniques are presented. The examples deal with focused overload in a simple network, predictive access-control and routing strategy, decentralized management, and multiclass traffic control.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Simulation results show that for conventional size cells, 32- and 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes are preferred for bit error rates (BER) above 1*10/sup -2/, while 4PSK or variable-rate QAM schemes are better for lower BER. For microcells with communications at both 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz, four- or six-cell clusters are advocated, depending on the SNR expected. Based on the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interference levels, it is argued that variable-rate QAM schemes are superior to the other modulation schemes considered. For low BERs 4PSK may often provide the best performance, whereas for high BERs, particularly when the SNR is high, 32- and 64-level star QAM are the most suitable.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The authors state that they have taken an approach to their research that allows the needs of users and the demands of end-to-end applications to shape the future of the multimedia communications network. They use several examples to show how such a perspective affects the development of practical, advanced communications services. These examples span a wide range, including: empirical studies of people's use of technology to communicate in collaborative work settings; the design of software supporting the real-time network delivery of interactive multimedia documents for casual information users in the home; and the creation of next-generation prototypes that support the transmission and viewing of multimedia information in homes, offices and classrooms.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

These parameters are then used by the network to allocate its resources among the different users in order to avoid congestion and maintain a predefined quality of service (QOS) for each user. The traffic characterization and modeling of the real-time bursty traffic, mainly voice and video traffic sources, using statistical methods are described. It is shown that the variability of the variance of the sum of consecutive packet interarrival times leads to significant queuing delays and therefore is a major cause of congestion in broadband networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Neural networks, however, are far more than devices that can learn accurate input-output transformation or form good category boundaries for pattern classifiers. They are a new form of computer, good at some unfamiliar problems, but quite poor at some familiar ones. An application involving a neural network learning some elementary arithmetic is discussed. It is shown that a simple network program can be implemented by differential weighting of the input data vector. In favorable cases the programming vector can be estimated by seeing relatively few examples of the output, if the task and the structure of the data allow it. Therefore, easy programming is allowed in only a limited domain, controlled by the data representation.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Numeris' growth exploded in 1991, increasing from 25000 sold B-channels at the end of 1990 to 150000 at the end of 1991; the goal is one million for 1995. The ISDN markets are reviewed, and the three needs that Numeris satisfies-application, computer networking, and PABX renewal-are described. A market forecast is presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The advanced intelligent network (AIN) is examined in terms of its history, present day architecture, and future evolution. The history of the AIN is traced from predivestiture 800 and calling card service capabilities, through IN/1, IN/2, and IN/1+, leading to the various AIN releases. The present-day view of the AIN architecture includes the switching system and other network systems, as well as operations. The AIN functionality supported by this architecture is described from a customer point of view, by means of an illustrative service that could be provided from an AIN platform. The next steps in the AIN evolution are discussed. An appendix that provides detailed information about the AIN Release 1 call model is included.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "Corporate data constitutes one of the most important assets possessed by corporations today. It provides the building blocks to form the information that underlies the operation of an enterprise. Because corporate data is created, managed, and stored in many forms and places, its value is directly related to the capability of its users to assess, manipulate, move, and manage it. It is argued that to support an integrated information environment, networks must be planned at the enterprise level, encompassing the entire organization. Trends in telecommunications development, including trends that influence user requirements and issues associated with technology availability, are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "One telecommunications company's-Sprint's-transformation of their infrastructure architecture away from dedicated transmission facilities and toward high-bandwidth virtual facilities which will enable customers to construct transmission networks that can be reconfigured almost instantaneously is described. Sprint's current X.25, frame-relay, switched circuit, and private line services are reviewed. The evolving architecture that will, on a moment's notice, enable a customer to redirect his traffic among the networks as well as to dynamically expand and contract transmission bandwidth to any of the networks is discussed. The architecture will be based on frame-relay permanent logical links at the end of 1992 and move to ATM cell-based access in 1994 to 1995.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The presentation and encoding of such multimedia and hypermedia information objects for the special needs of real-time, interactive, and communicating applications is the purpose of an International Organization for Standardization/Interexchange Carrier (SIO/IEC) group, known as Multimedia and Hypermedia Information Coding Expert Group (MHEG), the work of which is presented. The scope of the MHEG standard is explained, and an overview of the hierarchy of objects classes is provided, followed by a description of the methodology and coding principles developed in MHEG. The authors describe several categories of multimedia synchronization, making use of spatial and temporal relations between component objects, and relying on a scriptlike structure for more demanding situations.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Since the applications are predominantly based on the transmission of moving or still images, recent progress in data representation and compression that has an impact on the networking requirements is discussed. It is shown that asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) techniques can provide an acceptable, cost-effective means for meeting these requirements. The challenges that must be met, particularly in the local area, before the applications can be found in every laboratory and on every office desktop are outlined.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Market and technology trends affecting substrate networking, including analog to digital migration, multichannel-multipoint configurations, tail extensions off DS-1 backbones, hybrid networking, service restoration, disaster recovery, LAN interconnection, and multinational networking, are discussed.

It is argued that the perceived benefits of PCN, smaller handsets, improved communication quality, and increased capacity of the PCN technology, as compared with the competing cellular networks, are expected to give the personal communications concept mass-market appeal. Future technological developments for PCNs and issues concerning PCN development, including competition, pricing strategy and penetration, market confusion, and technological limitations, are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The advantages of ATM, the ATM cell format, the B-ISDN protocol reference model and the ATM layer, the ATM adaptation layer, and ATM traffic management and signaling are discussed. An experimental high-performance parallel interface (HIPPI)-ATM-SONET interface is presented as an example to illustrate how the SONET and ATM techniques can be used to provide end-to-end transport for applications requiring a bandwidth of 800 Mb/s and possibly 1600 Mb/s.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

   "abstract": "The challenges facing providers of global communication and information systems are discussed. Globe-girdling systems are compared to more confined systems. Unique facets of global systems are illustrated using IBM's worldwide information system as an example of an integrated enterprise network. Progress is sketched in other uses, including travel reservation, banking and finance, military, research and education. It is concluded that global systems' evolution can be predicted, in large measure, from prior progress in shorter-reach applications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
