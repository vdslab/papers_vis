   "abstract": "100BASE-T2 is a new physical-layer specification for IEEE 802.3 LANs operating at 100 Mb/s (\"Fast Ethernet\"). It enables users of the prevailing 10BASE-T Ethernet LAN technology to upgrade their networks from 10 to 100 Mb/s performance while retaining an existing voice-grade cabling infrastructure. 100BASE-T2 transceivers will operate over two pairs in unshielded twisted-pair cables corresponding to EIA/TIA category 3 (UTP-3), as minimally required for 10BASE-T. In a four-pair UTP-3 cable, simultaneous operation of two 100BASE-T2 links, or one 100BASE-T2 and one 10BASE-T link, is permitted. Since voice-grade cables exhibit more signal attenuation and significantly higher crosstalk coupling between adjacent pairs than data-grade cables, sophisticated digital signal processing techniques are needed to achieve reliable duplex 100 Mb/s transmission over two pairs. The 100BASE-T2 standard defines dual-duplex baseband transmission at a modulation rate of 25 Mbaud. During each modulation interval, a four-bit data nibble or Ethernet-specific control information is encoded into a pair of quinary signals. These signals are transmitted simultaneously on the two wire pairs in both signaling directions. In the receivers, adaptive digital filters are required for echo and NEXT cancellation, equalization, and interference suppression.",

   "abstract": "Many application domains (e.g., avionics, telecommunications, and multimedia) require real-time guarantees from the underlying networks, operating systems, and middleware components to achieve their quality of service (QoS) requirements. In addition to providing end-to-end QoS guarantees, applications in these domains must be flexible and reusable. Requirements for flexibility and reusability motivate the use of object-oriented middleware like the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). However, the performance of current CORBA implementations is not yet suited for hard real-time systems (e.g., avionics) and constrained latency systems (e.g., teleconferencing). This article describes the architectural features and optimizations required to develop real-time ORB end systems that can deliver end-to-end QoS guarantees to applications. While some operating systems, networks, and protocols now support real-time scheduling, they do not provide integrated solutions. The main thrust of this article is that advances in real-time distributed object computing can be achieved only by systematically pinpointing performance bottlenecks; optimizing the performance of networks, ORB end systems, common services, and applications; and simultaneously integrating techniques and tools that simplify application development.",

   "abstract": "The goal of this article is to describe the main ideas behind the new class of codes called turbo codes, whose performance in terms of bit error probability has been shown to be very close to the Shannon limit. In this article, the mathematical measures of a posteriori probability and likelihood are reviewed, and the benefits of turbo codes are explained in this context. Since the algorithms needed to implement the decoders have been well documented by others, they are only referenced here, not described in detail. A numerical example, using a simple concatenated coding scheme, provides a vehicle for illustrating how error performance can be improved when soft outputs from the decoders are used in an iterative decoding process.",

It explains some basic concepts, understanding which makes life on the Internet much easier. Now that the Internet is moving into the general knowledge of everybody and is taught in schools, we need to find some general, underlying ideas of how to deal with it. Wiring schools, as is happening now throughout the United States and other countries, is not enough. Teachers and students must be trained. This tutorial covers two small but important aspects of that training. The first part considers searching on the Internet; the second deals with quality and authority of information found on the Internet. It is a common mistake to assume that high technology guarantees high quality. Just because something is on the Web does not necessarily mean it is true.",

   "abstract": "Active networks are a novel approach to network architecture in which the switches (or routers) of the network perform customized computations on the messages flowing through them. This approach is motivated by both lead user applications, which perform user-driven computation at nodes within the network today, and the emergence of mobile code technologies that make dynamic network service innovation attainable. The authors discuss two approaches to the realization of active networks and provide a snapshot of the current research issues and activities. They illustrate how the routers of an IP network could be augmented to perform such customized processing on the datagrams flowing through them. These active routers could also interoperate with legacy routers, which transparently forward datagrams in the traditional manner.",

This article summarizes the main lessons learned through the authors' practical experiences with ATM and how these can be applied to performance tuning. In order to achieve maximum performance from an ATM WAN, factors ranging from the transport protocol to the equipment used and the network conditions must be carefully taken into consideration. The authors also discuss some of the software-based throughput measurement tools available for the evaluation of high speed network performance, with particular emphasis on NetSpec.",

   "abstract": "ATM network technology simplifies considerably the provision of services by providing the user with a unique interface to a single integrated service network that will handle all the user's needs. However, while it is possible to think of direct fiber connection to large business customers, where the amount of traffic (and hence the revenue) justifies the expense, the provision of broadband access to residential and small business customers has always been considered a challenge. The RACE II project BAF (Broadband Access Facilities) rose to that challenge, developing an ATM broadband access network that allows a relatively large number of users to share a single point of entry to the high-speed network economically. The BAF access network is not only cost effective but provides full dynamic bandwidth allocation between endpoints. This article presents a description of this network, the key issues that arose from the work, and the innovative ideas that were incorporated in the system. The article concludes with a discussion of some of the results of the field trial that was carried out on the demonstrator.",

   "abstract": "With the prospect of commercializing wireless ATM networks fast becoming a reality, and ATM becoming one of the main network technologies for multimedia computing, the design of ATM connection management solutions has to take into consideration these recent developments. Unfortunately, current ATM signaling solutions standardized by the ATM Forum have to be modified extensively in order to support wireless ATM. Furthermore, these solutions have not delivered a suitable multicast service which can support the communication requirements found in today's computer-based multimedia applications. The work described here therefore addresses these shortcomings by proposing a new multicast connection service architecture and its related algorithms. Some of the important concepts elaborated in the design include the notion of open signaling, the use of logical multicast groups to handle all connections, and seamless support for host mobility.",

   "abstract": "The growing trend of corporate organizations to embrace intranet technology is accelerating the computing paradigm shift from a desktop-centric model to a network-centric one. Intranet revamps the enterprise LAN and WAN by adorning them with the glaze of Internet attire. As with any kind of network, intranet reliability is subordinate to the attention and effort put into its management. Since what characterizes an intranet is not only its network infrastructure but also its information content and the way it is created, shared, and stored, intranet management must extend beyond typical network management issues and encompass service management. The authors elaborate on intranet management and reflect on the challenges it poses.",

   "abstract": "The statistical multiplexing operation within an ATM network node is considered, with respect to different methods for the allocation of the bandwidth of an outgoing link. Service separation is assumed by dividing the overall traffic flows into classes, homogeneous in terms of performance requirements and statistical characteristics. Which share the bandwidth of a link according to some specified policy. This context allows one to clearly define, by means of several existing approaches, a region in the space of connections of the different classes (call space) where quality of service (QoS) requirements at the cell level are satisfied. Within this region, some criteria for allocating the bandwidth of the link to the service classes are proposed, and the resulting allocation and call admission control (CAC) strategies are defined and analyzed. The goal of these operations is to achieve some desired QoS at the call level. Several numerical simulation results are presented, in order to highlight the different performance characteristics of the various methods.",

   "abstract": "The authors discuss the broad issue of bandwidth allocation and call admission control (CAC) in high-speed networks, focusing on asynchronous transfer mode technology. It is maintained that despite the considerable amount of high-quality work carried out in this area, the debate surrounding these issues is not yet resolved. The complexity of dealing with a wide variety of as yet unknown user traffic types, as well as the evolving architecture of networks, means that currently proposed solutions are only an intermediate step of the design process. The authors discuss the nature of user traffic and illustrate how it can impact the debate on the quality of service, concentrating on some \"equivalent bandwidth\" type CAC strategies. Also discussed is a method which uses diffusion approximations. Finally, the authors discuss the novel issue of evaluating the overload created by the CAC procedure itself on network nodes. The article is complemented by several numerical and simulation results which illustrate the discussion.",

This is a significant achievement of international collaboration and cooperation, and its benefits will be felt increasingly strongly as we enter the new millennium. However, there are three further issues for the management of ATM networks which need to be resolved before the work of this millennium can be considered to be complete. These are the management of switched virtual circuits, the coordination of management between different operators, and the different management protocols and their evolution. These issues are discussed, and new international standards which relate to them are introduced.",

   "abstract": "Three challenges for deploying broadband services are the time-consuming process of service creation, the interoperability over heterogeneous platforms, and the gap between the needs of service management and the functionalities of network management. We describe a methodology to attack the first two challenges, namely, to simplify the process of service creation and provide a platform-independent framework for service operations. A set of broadband service-independent building blocks (SIBs) are designed and used to create and customize SIB graphs for broadband services. During service running time, the service agent interprets a SIB graph and executes SIB procedures which are all downloaded from the service provider. Web, Java, and CORBA are the technological elements of this methodology. Two examples, video conferencing and video on demand, are given to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.",

   "abstract": "This article reviews the technologies and potential markets, applications, and architectures for broadband wireless access. The emergence of wireless communications for cellular systems is presented, together with its projected future evolution to mobile wideband systems. The field of broadband access systems, services, and network architectures is also covered, and then systems for broadband wireless communications for indoor local area networks and outdoor public fixed access networks are discussed. Broadband wireless access systems are emerging as a new and growing area of telecommunications, since the ability to provide access without extensive installation of copper or fiber infrastructures make wireless technology well suited for broadband services. Finally, some of the key enabling technologies, such as adaptive antennas and video compression, and the future architectural directions of broadband wireless networks are presented.",

   "abstract": "There is a worldwide effort to define a full-service access network. The Broadbandloop project was formed by a European consortium funded by the European Union with the objective of defining a strategy for evolution from a narrowband voice and data network to a broadband network. The project is defining a system concept based on new innovative PON technology, which enables fiber to cost effectively penetrate close to the customer, and VDSL technology for transmission over twisted copper pairs. The system concept is validated in field trials in Denmark, Portugal, and Poland. The article describes the different requirements for a full-service access network, the system concept, and technologies developed. Results from modeling of broadband traffic and the corresponding bandwidth are given. The cost effectiveness of using new optical fiber vs. reusing existing telephone copper plant has been evaluated, and results from these studies are presented.",

   "abstract": "Large computer networks such as corporate intranets and the Internet are inherently heterogeneous due to such factors as increasingly rapid technological change, engineering trade-offs, accumulation of legacy systems over time, and varying system costs. Unfortunately, such heterogeneity makes the development and maintenance of applications that make the best use of such networks difficult. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture specification created by the Object Management Group provides a stable model for distributed object-oriented systems that helps developers cope with heterogeneity and inevitable change. Applications written to the CORBA standard are abstracted away from underlying networking protocols and transports, instead relying on object request brokers to provide a fast and flexible communication and object activation substrated. The abstractions provided by CORBA ORBs are currently serving as the basis for applications in a wide variety of problem domains, including telecommunications, finance, medicine, and manufacturing, running on platforms ranging from mainframes down to test and measurement equipment. This article first provides an overview of the Object Management Architecture, then describes in detail the CORBA component of that architecture, and concludes with a description of the OMG organization along with some of its current and future work.",

These experiments evaluated the quality of coded speech under a variety of conditions: (i) interworking with other international and regional speech coding standards; (ii) input speech that had been corrupted by environmental noise; (iii) operation over degraded transmission channels (including random bit errors and a simulated radio channel). The results of these experiments indicate that 8 kb/s G.729 meets the performance requirements that were established at the beginning of the standardization process.",

   "abstract": "For almost three years the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been working on the specification of the general packet radio service (GPRS) for the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). In the course of 1997 standardization will come to an end, and a first introduction of GPRS by a service provider or network operator is likely to take place in 1999. The new service will accommodate data connections with variable bit rates and high bandwidth efficiency, and thus offers the possibility to attract a wide range of new applications to GSM networks. In this article possible applications and elementary concepts and service characteristics of GPRS are explained in detail. Furthermore, a medium access control protocol that conforms to the draft standard proposal for the GPRS air interface is introduced and analyzed. Thereafter, the simulation model is described and simulation results presented. The performance analysis carried out shows reasonable performance even under high load conditions.",

These requirements motivate the use of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). However, building highly available applications with CORBA is hard. Neither the CORBA standard nor conventional implementations of CORBA directly address complex problems related to distributed computing, such as real-time or high-speed quality of service, partial failures, group communication, and causal ordering of events. This article describes a CORBA-based framework that uses the virtual synchrony model to support reliable data- and process-oriented distributed systems that communicate through synchronous methods and asynchronous messaging.",

   "abstract": "In this article the authors identify reliability, privacy, and security as critical issues in electronic commerce. In other work, designers of information systems have identified other issues as critical, such as the ability to provide offline verification. It is widely agreed that an electronic currency system must provide divisibility, scalability in number of users, conservation of money or tamper resistance, exchangeability or interoperability, and availability. However, by returning to the fundamental definition of money and the essential nature of electronic information systems, the authors argue that privacy, reliability, and security are also critical issues. It is argued that these issues are particularly important in Internet commerce. The authors conclude by noting how some proposed Internet commerce systems provide, or fail to provide, security, reliability, and privacy.",

   "abstract": "Effective operations of today's access networks based on intelligent, computer-controlled network elements is a key issue. Due to the increased complexity of operation and the cost pressure in a competitive telco environment, a possible answer for these challenges is the introduction of sophisticated network operations (network management) technologies. On the other side, the costs of customer operations in connection with access networks are also very substantial. Any improvement in this field can increase the capabilities of the access operator to maximize the revenue stream. Another issue is that in the near future all operators will be forced to introduce next-generation customer operation systems simply to be able to survive. This article discusses the general issues of both access network management and customer operations in a tutorial manner.",

   "abstract": "When designing and configuring an ATM-based B-ISDN, it remains difficult to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) for different service classes, while still allowing enough statistical sharing of bandwidth so that the network is efficiently utilized. These two goals are often conflicting. Guaranteeing QoS requires traffic isolation, as well as allocation of enough network resources (e.g., buffer space and bandwidth) to each call. However, statistical bandwidth sharing means the network resources should be occupied on demand, leading to less traffic isolation and minimal resource allocation. The authors address this problem by proposing and evaluating a network-wide bandwidth management framework in which an appropriate compromise between the two conflicting goals is achieved. Specifically, the bandwidth management framework consists of a network model and a network-wide bandwidth allocation and sharing strategy. Implementation issues related to the framework are discussed. For real-time applications the authors obtain maximum queuing delay and queue length, which are important in buffer design and VP (virtual path) routing.",

   "abstract": "This article examines the application of distributed objects to the construction of highly available distributed systems for mobile, ubiquitous computing. High availability for the end user entails the provision of ubiquitous access and flexible resource-sharing. The defining characteristics of mobile computing, such as the frequent movement of users and hosts, the scarcity of network and local computing resources available to the mobile host, and the possibility of disconnections, present difficult challenges in providing high availability for clients in a distributed object system. Meeting these challenges requires dynamic object management techniques in the distributed server architecture on the fixed wired network, as well as object replica management techniques to achieve connection transparency and disconnected operation in the mobile client architecture. Various issues and solutions in constructing a dynamic distributed object-oriented architecture capable of supporting mobile computing are presented.",

   "abstract": "The radio broadband networks suffer from some specific constraints-access protocol efficiency, multipath effects, and limited available frequency bands-which have to be overcome by choosing the best possible compromises in cost/performance on physical and MAC layers. Current WLAN products (1-2 Mb/s at 2.45 GHz), which provide mainly data exchange service, are able to make seamless handover for an indoor cellular network but suffer from relatively low data rates. Even if compliant with the IEEE 802.11 future standard, they do not necessarily lead to interoperability. New generations become necessary for higher data transfer rates, real-time video, and multimedia applications compatible with the future ATM transfer mode. ETSI is proposing the HIPERLAN concept, working in the 5.3 and 17.2 GHz bands. Our contribution to this new standard, called RNET (Radio Network), uses a spread spectrum linear ramp waveform with enhanced capabilities (relative to the TDMA, CSMA/CA, and FDMA structures). The advantages of the MAC layer are highlighted and the first results of a transceiver demonstrator are given.",

   "abstract": "The interactive video (IV) market has been expected to capture a significant share of the huge potential revenues to be generated by the business and residential markets. The level of revenues generated depends on the completion rate of calls the service provider can support, no matter what the IV system or network condition. Thus, a cost-effective, scalable fault-tolerant IV system is needed to maximize the video call completion rate at an affordable cost. This article describes design methodologies for a scalable, fault-tolerant IV system and an IV system design and analysis research prototype called IVSDNA (IV System Designer and Analyzer). The IVSDNA prototype is designed to help network planners and engineers to evaluate quantitative trade-offs (in terms of network communications costs, video storage costs, and degree of system fault tolerance) between two major IV system architectures (centralized and distributed) with a variety of video distribution methods, replication strategies, and fault-tolerant access protocols.",

   "abstract": "Two one-way channels are normally used in digital two-way voice communication. Each channel is in effect-used only one half the time. A recent discovery of ours recognized that any one-way channel within a satellite spot-beam can be accessed by anyone in the footprint of the beam. In a two-way voice call, the two parties alternate (in principle) in their transmissions-when one speaks the other is silent. Therefore, the two can share a single one-way channel and provide continuous use of the channel, their respective transmissions interleaved with one another. This condition is unique to intrabeam communication via satellite (or balloon). In a satellite system, capacity is a valued commodity, where capacity is limited by allocated bandwidth and power available. Under those two constraints of bandwidth and power limitation, the discovery described generates a doubling of capacity. This article addresses this concept and some of the engineering challenges and opportunities arising therefrom.",

Dynamic allocation uses actual traffic behavior, while static allocation uses only the reference traffic condition given a priori. Examples of dynamic allocation strategies are available bit rate flow control, dynamic connection admission control, and dynamic VP bandwidth control. Dynamic resource allocation is shown to be promising for situations where the a priori reference model is unclear.",

   "abstract": "General design considerations for the broadband information highway of the future are given in the context of interactive broadband services to the home. As potential precursors to this highway, the telephone, the Internet, and cable television networks are examined. Several emerging technologies are also examined as candidates for the future local subscriber loop. For the information highway, classes of network services are proposed that are independent of the specific network technologies used. It is suggested that the information highway be partitioned logically or physically so as to provide a variety of service levels according to the subscriber's cost and quality of service requirements. This should yield better network economies and provide the end user with a viable range of connectivity options.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a framework for multimedia networking in a wireless and mobile environment. We consider both multimedia application needs as well as networking requirements, and try to bridge these paradigms using an adaptive framework. Central to this framework is the concept of representing a multimedia connection in terms of multiple substreams each with their own specified QoS requirement and making network elements (switching and access points), services, and protocols (signaling, control, routing) aware of the QoS requirements of such substreams. As resource availability in the wireless and mobile network fluctuates, the network selects and schedules substreams in order to present the information content with an acceptable quality at a receiver (or each receiver in case of multicast connections). This is done while achieving a reasonable utilization efficiency of network resources and sharing them in a fair manner.",

Of particular interest are ways to implement cellular/PCS or high-speed data networks in airborne platforms. From a communications perspective, HAAPs would have many advantages over both their terrestrial and satellite counterparts. If HAAPs prove to be reasonably stable, reliable, and not too costly, they will offer considerable opportunities for wireless services provision, and the introduction of innovative communications concepts such as cell scanning and stratospheric radio relays.",

   "abstract": "Telecommunications management network (TMN)-based object models need to satisfy the three objectives of interoperability, integration, and flexibility in order to support rapid provision of future broadband services. While current models are focused on interoperability, it is necessary to consider new techniques to deliver the integration and flexibility capabilities required for these services. The Open Distributed Processing Reference Model (RM-ODP), coupled with CORBA technology, has been proposed as a distributed environment to provide the integration and flexibility capabilities lacking in existing protocols. Existing protocols will continue to be widely used for broadband management interfaces as the distributed environment evolves. The challenge is to maximize the benefits of the distributed environment without compromising the benefits already delivered by the existing protocols. A multiplicity of models has been developed to differing requirements and using differing methodologies. Although there is much commonality between these models, a final stage of convergence is needed to produce a unified network model. There are outstanding issues for definition of management services, resource models, and at the computational level, which need to be resolved for successful evolution to distributed systems. However, a partnership between formal standards bodies and other organizations and consortia which exploits their complementary strengths will ensure that distributed network management of the TMN will become a reality.",

The evolution phases are designed to fulfill the following evolution requirements. Each phase provides an incentive to the operator and the customer by providing more functionality, higher bit rates, or reduced cost. The phases are realistic for low penetration and match the growth of infrastructure to the gradual growth of the demand. Technologies are independently introduced in the access and core networks depending on demand. The evolution scenario starts with ADSL and evolves toward ultra-broadband access networks based on SuperPON architectures. The new enhanced APON architecture is introduced as a practical intermediate evolution phase. For the first time, the principle of segmentation is applied to APONs/SuperPONs to enable gradual growth in number of subscribers and network capacity. Optical channels and wavelength-division multiplexing are introduced in the core network.",

In light of these constraints, the authors summarize progress made in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) toward standards for future access networks.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a system designed to substitute current centralized Internet search engines with a distributed indexing scheme in a gradual sequence of steps. The advantage of this transition process is that each of the steps is relatively simple and at the same time makes a significant contribution to the quality of the whole system, resulting in a system with remarkable properties. It is scalable and automatically adaptive, and it facilitates not only the search for information, but also cooperative information filtering and decentralized publishing. Current technology is based on the use of large centralized databases and has potential scalability problems which will become apparent with the further growth of the Internet. This is why the authors believe that sooner or later the transition process presented in this article will take place. The main principles of the new distributed system are presented and discussed. The authors also identify the problems environments such as the Internet present for resource discovery systems. A number of resource discovery projects targeting these problems are analyzed in the second part of the article, and their strengths and disadvantages are identified.",

   "abstract": "Multimedia communication has become the driving force for installing broadband systems in the public network. Different alternative solutions have been presented to realize a broadband interactive access network, such as installing optical fiber or upgrading the existing copper network with ADSL for twisted pair or hybrid fiber coax for CATV networks. Among these alternatives, optical fiber access networks are seen as the most future-safe solution. Especially, passive optical networks prove to be a cost-effective way to introduce fiber into the access network. This article presents ATM-based transport on passive optical networks, starting with a current implementation of an ATM-PON (APON) system that has already been installed for various trials. It further describes the evolution of APON systems to high-splitting, long-range PONs. The increase in both number of subscribers and distance range is discussed in combination with some specific technological issues such as upstream burst mode optical amplification. Special emphasis is placed on the work carried out within the scope of the ACTS PLANET project.",

Individual privacy rights; prevention of malicious behavior by irresponsible individuals; protecting the interests of computer system owners, operators, users, and the general public from computer crime; excluding unauthorized access; and preventing destruction of national computer systems (e.g.. interbank transaction systems) are issues that can be endemic to GII operations. More recent issues, such as the need for high-definition television standards, expand the global challenges. Hence, the body of work performed by the Committee on Communications and Information Policy (CCIP) for the IEEE-USA.

The article identifies the NII issues and concerns to the CCIP, outlines the recommendations already made, and indicates how they relate to the GII.",

Another important goal of the technology is to make it possible for GSM license holders to share physical resources on a dynamic, flexible basis between packet data services and other GSM services.

These algorithms need to be implemented in hardware in a high-speed switch. The authors present a number of approaches to implement scheduling algorithms in hardware. They begin by presenting a general methodology for the design of timestamp-based fair queuing algorithms that provide the same bounds on end-to-end delay and fairness as those of weighted fair queuing, yet have efficient hardware implementations. Based on this general methodology, the authors describe two specific algorithms, frame-based fair queuing and starting potential-based fair queuing, and discuss illustrative implementations in hardware. These algorithms may be used in both cell switches and packet switches with variable-size packets. A methodology for combining a traffic shaper with this class of fair queuing schedulers is also presented for use in network interface devices, such as an ATM segmentation and reassembly device.",

The authors discuss some important aspects of creating high-capacity cellular networks that operate with a limited amount of frequency spectrum. Macrocells are initially used to build a network with cost-effective wide-area coverage. By decreasing site-to-site distance and tightening frequency reuse, the capacity of the macro network can be increased substantially. Subsequently, micro- and picocells are added, creating a multilayered cellular network. Methods such as power control, efficient frequency allocation, and traffic control between the layers are employed to exploit the full potential of the network.",

In this article, the IEEE 802.11 protocol is explained, with particular emphasis on the medium access control sublayer. Performance results are provided for packetized data and a combination of packetized data and voice over the WLAN. Our performance investigation reveals that an IEEE 802.11 network may be able to carry traffic with time-bounded requirements using the point coordination function. However, our findings suggest that packetized voice traffic must be handled in conjunction with an echo canceler.",

Methods for separately supporting multicasting and mobility along with their possible interactions are briefly described, and then various solutions to the combined problem are explored. We examine three different multicast delivery mechanisms and compare them based on their efficiency and impact on host protocol software. We describe proposals for integrating multicasting and mobility in the Internet architecture. We first present IP extensions for host mobility and other extensions for multicasting. We then examine local multicasting mechanisms, focusing on a group membership protocol that is optimized for wireless point-to-point links. Next, we examine the problems of sending and receiving multicast datagrams in a wide area network. For multicast reception, we describe three alternative proposals and compare them by examining both their applicability and their performance, as well as possible tradeoffs among the two.",

   "abstract": "This article describes the ITU-T Recommendation G.729 Annex A (G.729A) for encoding speech signals at 8 kb/s with low complexity. G.729A is the standard speech coding algorithm for multimedia digital simultaneous voice and data (DSVD). G.729A is bitstream interoperable with G.729; that is, speech coded with G.729A can be decoded with G.729, and vice versa. Like G.729, it uses the conjugate-structure algebraic code excited linear prediction (CS-ACELP) algorithm with 10 ms frames. However, several algorithmic changes have been introduced which result in a 50 percent reduction in complexity. This article describes the algorithm introduced to achieve the low complexity goal while meeting the terms of reference. Subjective tests showed that the performance of G.729A is equivalent to both G.729 and G.726 at 32 kb/s in most operating conditions; however, it is slightly worse in the case of three tandems and in the presence of background noise. A breakdown of the complexities of both G.729 and G.729A is also given.",

   "abstract": "This article describes Annex B to ITU-T Recommendation G.729. Annex B defines a low-bit-rate silence compression scheme designed and optimized to work in conjunction with both the full version of G.729 and its low-complexity Annex A. To achieve good quality low-bit-rate silence compression, a robust frame-based voice activity detector module is essential to detect inactive voice frames, also called silence or background noise frames. For these detected inactive voice frames, a discontinuous transmission module measures the changes over time of the inactive voice signal characteristics and decides whether a new silence information descriptor frame should be sent to maintain the reproduction quality of the background noise at the receiving end. If such a frame is needed, the spectrum and energy parameters describing the perceptual characteristics of the background noise are efficiently coded and transmitted using 15 b/frame. At the receiving end, the comfort noise generation module regenerates the output background noise using transmitted updates or previously available parameters. The synthesized background noise is obtained by linear predictive filtering of a locally generated pseudo-white excitation signal of a controlled level. This method of coding the background noise enables the achievement of bit-rate savings for coded speech at average rates as low as 4 kb/s during normal speech conversation while maintaining reproduction quality.",

   "abstract": "The authors consider connection-oriented wireless cellular networks such as IS-54, IS-95, GSM, and wireless ATM networks. These are connection-oriented digital networks which employ separate radio channels for the transmission of signaling information. A forward signaling channel is a common signaling channel assigned to carry the multiplexed stream of paging and channel-allocation packets from a base station to mobile stations. For wireless ATM networks, paging and virtual-circuit (VC) allocation packets are multiplexed across the forward signaling channels as part of the VC setup phase. A reverse signaling channel, which employs a contention-oriented medium access algorithm, is used by mobile stations to send channel-request and location-update packets. A location area is a region which includes a specified set of adjacent cells; it is used to track the location of mobile stations. Mobile units must reregister as they cross the boundary of a location area. The channel setup and paging response times are critical performance factors in the design of the signaling subsystem. A location area structure must be suitably selected to ensure that acceptable levels of such performance functions are achieved. A network which employs small location-areas will experience a high rate of location updates, while larger location areas lead to higher traffic intensities of paging messages. The authors overview a method for calculating the performance behavior of signaling messages. Subsequently the impact of the location area structure on the performance of the signaling system is investigated.",

   "abstract": "Information infrastructures and multimedia communications are necessary prerequisites for the future information society. Approaching the multimedia world of tomorrow, the telephone world, the data world, and the radio/TV world of today will overlap to a growing extent. This is true for utilization and technology as well as for market and competition. There will more likely be an application revolution; however, for networks-and partly for services and terminals, too-it has to be an evolution. Among others, ISDN and later ATM networks are expected to contribute to efficient information infrastructures and multimedia communications. The article discusses overall concepts for office, home, and travel; end-to-end solutions, including the intelligence and management needed (full-service and application-ready networks); and suitable standardization of architectures, building blocks, and platforms. For the transfer toward the information society, many political and legal problems have still to be solved on a national and international basis, in addition to technical and economical aspects. The immense upheaval, at least, asks for some common vision and some joint action through pragmatic cooperation of the parties involved.",

   "abstract": "The growth of the global Internet is causing a dramatic change in both the kind of people who access information and the types of information itself, ranging from unstructured multimedia data to traditional record-oriented data. To cope with these new needs, the interaction techniques traditionally offered to DBMS users have to evolve and eventually integrate in a powerful interface to the global information infrastructure. In particular, from the user's point of view there is the need for both effective visualization of multimedia information and retrieval tools able to overcome the existing dichotomy between browsing and querying. This article concentrates on the mutual relationship between database querying and Internet navigation by reviewing some important contributions from different areas, such as information retrieval, database research, and visualization techniques.",

These trials and small-scale commercial deployments lack novel applications and services that make effective use of network capabilities and attract users to experiment with them. The rapid explosion of the Internet has also played a role in the current lack of interest and investment in broadband video networks. This article examines the lessons learned from the commercial deployment of a switched fiber-coax video dial tone network in Dover Township, New Jersey, USA. Future broadband networks will have to combine the capabilities of video dial tone networks and the Internet at an attractive price. Innovative end-to-end applications that go beyond cable TV and movies on demand are needed to renew commercial interest in residential broadband networks.",

In this paper, a complete scenario for the provision of interactive multimedia services from the residential user's point of view is considered, focusing on software components. Initially, a reference architecture configuration, based on the DAVIC paradigm, suitable for the provision of residential interactive broadband services is presented. In addition to hardware capabilities, the system will be considered successful only if it is easy to learn, worth the time and cost-effective. Consequently, a set of possible service requirements is introduced and a development process for distributed interactive multimedia applications is proposed. Finally, based on experience gained from the implementation of applications in different residential trials throughout Europe, guidelines and methodologies for user interface design are illustrated.",

   "abstract": "The Internet has created a new cost-implosive economic for long distance interaction and assisted in the creation of global organizations. A guiding vision for Internet governance is proposed, based in that economic, and the resultant emerging global civil society. New organizations and global civil society will challenge the existing rule of law, traditions, and culture far more than the Internet does today. The experience of social activists in Central Europe during the 1980s in acting to bring a civil society into existence, shows the practical application of this model. Using these concepts as a guide, participants in Internet governance should recognize this trend, discover the new opportunities it presents, and encourage the further creation of a worldwide Internet constituency of technical and policy experts to reinforce, exploit, and further develop it. New technical developments should continue to follow the \"deployment-propagation\" model, and thus to test technical validity through real-world use. The Internet process and its participant groups should \"de-Americanize\" in order to innovate more and to ensure adoption by the world at large. Failure to do so could cause the Internet to lose its fundamental character, followed by the loss of its tremendous promise of economic, social, and technical progress.",

The overhead due to location management techniques used in the present cellular systems such as GSM, in particular in high traffic spots, has already been a source of concern and is expected to augment dramatically in future wireless systems. Several proposals have been made in the past addressing the problem associated with the cost of location management. The author provides an overview of these contributions; in particular, he classifies the techniques, mainly into non-memory-based and memory-based approaches. Subsequently, a simple evaluation of the current location updating procedure used in GSM is presented in the context of a PCS framework to illustrate the load placed on the radio channels and on the MSC/VLR processing.",

   "abstract": "As users, services, databases, and computers become increasingly mobile, so fades the era of the fixed network. Modern networks are becoming mobile networks which must accommodate a broad range services with differing mobility characteristics. Consequently, there is an impetus to understand mobility and its effect on communications systems. Of particular interest are the unique stresses imposed by mobile computing and especially mobile computer programs (agents). As an aid to greater understanding, we propose a theoretical framework for the study of mobility tracking based on user/service/host location probability distributions. We show how this methodology, using stochastic ordering and information theory, can enable quantitative comparison of various mobility management schemes as well as insight into the mobility tracking problem over a wide range of mobility characteristics. This general approach should aid both applications and future research.",

   "abstract": "The ATLANTA/sup TM/ switching architecture has the following distinguishing characteristics: (1) is nonblocking, (2) scales modularly over a wide range of switching and buffering capacities using commonly available implementation technology, (3) achieves high buffer utilization while using distributed buffers, (4) has low complexity, and (5) provides a clear path for future growth in features. The ATLANTA architecture uses an innovative structure with ingress and egress buffers, where selective backpressure is applied from the fabric to the ingress cards. Selective backpressure makes the buffers in the ingress cards act as an extension of the output buffers in the fabric, achieving \"sharing\" of the distributed buffers and buffer utilization comparable with a centralized shared-memory switch. The advantage is that the majority of the buffers are in the ingress and egress port cards, and are implemented using low-cost off-the-shelf memories regardless of the total switching capacity. Different arrangements are possible for the switch fabric. In the smallest configuration, the fabric consists of a single standalone switching module; for larger switching capacities, the fabric is a modular three-stage memory/space/memory (MSM) arrangement. The ATLANTA architecture provides optimal support of multicast traffic. The ATLANTA chipset provides the complete set of building blocks for implementing ATM switches ranging in capacity from 622 Mb/s to 25 Gb/s. The chipset consists of four chips, two devices to be used in the fabric and two in the port cards. The port devices provide full-duplex ingress and egress functionality at 622 Mb/s port rate (plus the overhead due to the local header used internally to the switch). The physical interface to the incoming/outgoing lines supports the UTOPIA II multiplexing standard, and the port devices manage multiplexing/demultiplexing from/to a maximum of 30 subports per port. Although our current implementation of the architecture is targeted primarily to ATM, the principles behind the architecture are more general, and apply to IP switching and routing technologies.",

The article provides the results of a set of analyses conducted to compare two major radio technologies, DECT/PWT-E and PACS, for their suitability in the local loop to provide voice and data services for customers. The authors first provide brief discussions on the Japanese Personal Handyphone System (PHS) and Omnipoint's Combined CDMA/TDMA (CCT) system as potential candidates. The authors do not currently consider them viable alternatives for local loop since the PHS is not suitable for the US environment, and the CCT system will not be available in the near future. The PACS and PWT-E systems are then compared based on their architecture, service, coverage, and operations-related capabilities. The authors also compare them in proposed deployments in Jacksonville and Miami, Florida. Finally, the authors draw some conclusions from their study.",

DECT, digital enhanced cordless telecommunications, is a radio interface standard developed in Europe mainly for indoor wireless applications and being promoted lately for wireless local loop applications as well. PWT, personal wireless telecommunications, is a DECT-based standard developed by the TIA in the United States for the unlicensed PCS applications. PWT-E, enhanced, is the version that is suitable for the licensed PCS applications. PACS, personal access communications systems, is a total system standard (i.e. radio interface and associated network infrastructures) developed in the United States for licensed PCS applications. (PACS-UA and PACS-UB are the standards for the unlicensed PCS applications.) For the wireless local loop (WLL), we make an assumption that the radio technologies operating in the licensed PCS spectrum are more suitable to provide a quality of service that is expected traditionally from a local exchange company (LEC). Therefore, this article focuses on the PACS and PWT-E, rather than PACS-UB and PWT. Also note that the article focuses on the North American version, PWT-E, rather than the European version, DECT. It provides an introduction to the PACS and PWT technologies.",

   "abstract": "The increasing number and heterogeneity of networked personal computers (PCs) along with the integration of PC networks into classical data processing infrastructures consisting of UNIX, NT, and mainframe servers is one of the most important computing trends in recent years. The variety of operating systems and system configurations turns management in this environment into a complex task. Obviously, this scenario cannot be efficiently managed with proprietary or dedicated tools alone. Management applications must become part of an integrated network, system and application management solution. This need is further exacerbated by the increasing appearance of mobile systems. Relevant management tasks such as inventory management, software distribution, remote control, and license management are presented according to their need in different PC networking environments. An overview of the DMI standard of the DMTF as well as the Web-based enterprise management (WBEM) and Java management API (JMAPI) activities is followed by a discussion of organizational and operational issues for PC management projects. A brief outlook concludes the presentation of this new, complex and very dynamic area in management.",

   "abstract": "No matter how good the transmission technology, if you can not manage it, you can not use it. Telecommunications planners are faced with simultaneously provisioning the explosion of lines linking homes and businesses with central offices and planning for a future where highly sophisticated interactive broadband services must be provided. Managing all portions of the network is complicated, but none more so than the access network known colloquially as \"the last mile,\" the low data speed capacity lines that actually connect the home or business to the high-speed network. Before a line used for plain old telephone service (POTS), called a loop, can be used in higher speed applications it must be checked to make sure that it has the right electrical characteristics. The evolution of the loop from POTS to midband to broadband usage is examined emphasizing the relevant plant administration processes. Using today's special service administration is an expensive way to provide service. Alternates to special service provisioning are described.",

   "abstract": "Mobile IP has been designed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to serve the needs of the burgeoning population of mobile computer users who wish to connect to the Internet and maintain communications as they move from place to place. The basic protocol is described, with details given on the three major component protocols: agent advertisement, registration, and tunneling. Then route optimization procedures are outlined, and further topics of current interest are described. The available tunneling mechanisms are shown, which the home agent uses to forward datagrams from the home network to the mobile computer. Having covered the details of the base mobile IP specification, we then describe further protocol messages which help to decrease the inefficiency associated with inserting the home agent in the routing path of data destined for mobile computers. Finally, we summarize and discuss the current problems facing mobile IP, as well as a few areas of active protocol development.",

   "abstract": "Mobile ATM offers a common wired network infrastructure to support mobility of wireless terminals, independent of the wireless access protocol. In addition, it allows seamless migration to future wireless broadband services, such as wireless ATM, by enabling mobility of end-to-end ATM connections. In spite of the diversity in mobile networking technologies (e.g., cellular telephony, mobile-IP, packet data services, PCS), all of them require two fundamental mechanisms: location management and handoff. This article describes different schemes for augmenting a wired ATM network to support location management of mobile terminals and handoff protocols for rerouting a connection data path when the endpoint moves. A prototype implementation of mobile ATM integrating mobility support with ATM signaling and connection setup, is presented. It shows how mobile ATM may be used to provide mobility support to an IP terminal using non-ATM wireless access.",

   "abstract": "There has been rapid growth in the demand for mobile communications that has led to intensive research and development of complex PCS (personal communication services) networks. Capacity planning and performance modeling are necessary to maintain a high quality of service to the PCS subscriber while minimizing costs. Effective and practical performance models for large-scale PCS networks are available. Two new performance models are presented in this article which can be solved using analytical techniques. The first is the so-called portable population model, based on the flow equivalent assumption (the rate of portables into a cell equals the rate of portables out of the cell). The model provides the steady-state portable population distribution in a cell that is independent of the portable residual time distribution, which can be used by simulations to reduce the necessary execution time by reaching the steady state more rapidly. Additionally, this model can be used to study the blocking probability of a low (portable) mobility PCS network and the performance of portable deregistration strategies. The second model is the so-called portable movement model which can be used to study location tracking and handoff algorithms. The model assumes that the arriving calls to a portable form a Poisson process, and portable residual times have a general distribution. This model can be used to study location-tracking algorithms and handoff algorithms. It is shown that under some assumptions, the analytic techniques are consistent with the simulation model.",

The authors first give an overview of the development and architecture of the current MBone. One important characteristic of the MBone is its reliance on IP multicast which allows receivers to join and leave groups asynchronously. The authors describe the Mlisten data collection tool that was created to provide a mechanism for capturing information about when members join and leave a multicast group. Using data collected with Mlisten, the authors present statistics about some of the MBone sessions they monitored. Results are provided for key parameters including multicast participant interarrival times and participant durations, multicast tree size and characteristics, and intersession relationships. Collecting data about MBone usage can improve our understanding of how multicast communication and real-time protocols are being used today.",

   "abstract": "The concept of wireless ATM is now being actively considered as a potential framework for next-generation wireless communication networks capable of supporting integrated multimedia services with different QoS requirements. Several key subsystem design issues for wired ATM and wireless networks need to be readdressed in the scope of the wireless ATM. One of the main key subsystem issues is the development of the appropriate medium access control (MAC) protocol, which has the capability to extend the statistical multiplexing of the wired ATM network into the wireless medium. In this article the authors address the problem of a suitable MAC protocol for the specification of a wireless ATM network and outline the design objectives. In addition, the authors address some other challenging key issues that the wireless medium and wireless network architecture impose on the ATM stack protocol.",

To achieve such advanced wireless systems. New system design concepts different from the conventional ones aiming at increasing system capacity for voice transmission would be required. Since multimedia wireless communications require high quality, high speed, and high flexibility as well as temporary and spatial control of traffic under severe fading environments, the so-called conventional system design concept will be insufficient. New system design concepts and techniques for achieving highly reliable and high-capacity multimedia wireless communications are discussed using both time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) systems. The demands for high-speed and high-reliability mobile, personal, and multimedia wireless communications services strongly require matching with the trunk network constructed by a broadband optical fiber system or wired system.",

In considering OA&amp;M costs it is necessary to take into account both equipment costs and operational costs. The main principles presented for minimizing OA&amp;M costs are: the use of standard interfaces and information models where possible; minimizing the need for special operational skills and maintenance tools; provision of accurate maintenance information by the system; promoting reuse by locating complex functions at common points to enable sharing of platforms; provision of functions for locating faults and detecting network degradation; and the need to build in the ability to evolve and upgrade the network and its management capability.",

   "abstract": "Emerging B-ISDN applications are accelerating the demand for high-speed and high-performance fiber optic local and metropolitan area networks (LANs and MANs). Most of the networks proposed for such an environment are based on either a folded bus or dual unidirectional bus technology, primarily due to the unidirectional nature of the fiber optic medium, their cost effectiveness, and their ability to carry asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cells. Consequently, the design of the medium access control (MAC) protocols is the most crucial aspect for these networks since the decisions made at this level will determine the capabilities and the hardware cost of the network. The author proposes a novel MAC-layer protocol, called Optical Reservation Multiple Access (ORMA), which is suitable for data traffic on fiber optic folded bus MANs and LANs. Its main feature is an efficient optical reservation technique to allow stations to reserve transmission slots, which is attractive for use in fiber optic networks. Unlike conventional protocols. Where reservation is mostly done using software, ORMA performs its reservation using simple and effective optical circuits. Complete descriptions of the ORMA protocol and the associated nodes are given. Then the performance of ORMA is investigated as a function of the throughput, mean packet delay, and fairness among stations using analytical and simulation results. Our protocol is shown to achieve high throughput and small transmission delays while preserving the fairness of the whole network. Moreover, it compares favorably with related state-of-the-art networks. Thus, the ORMA protocol lends itself well to future-generation high-speed MANs and LANs.",

   "abstract": "The growing popularity of portable and mobile computing and communication devices, along with the introduction of wireline broadband networks, is fueling demand for wireless broadband networks. Since ATM has been accepted as the standard for broadband integrated service networks, the authors consider the problem of providing \"ATM-like services\" to mobile devices. The fundamental issues that have to be tackled in order to provide broadband services which are currently available (or will be very shortly) to wireline hosts are discussed. The authors compare and contrast the architectures that have been proposed for extending the broadband wireline network infrastructure to the wireless environment. It is argued that transporting small ATM cells over the air leads to inefficient utilization of the already scarce transmission capacity. Subsequently, the authors propose an architecture for integrated wireless and wireline broadband networks which allows the wireline and wireless parts of the network to be designed independently, therefore allowing each to be optimized for the environment in which it operates. At the same time, the proposed architecture also permits simple and efficient interconnection between the wireline and wireless infrastructures.",

   "abstract": "We present a general cell-design methodology for the optimal design of a multitier wireless cellular network. Multitier networks are useful when there are a multitude of traffic types with drastically different parameters and/or different requirements, such as different mobility parameters or quality-of-service requirements. In such situations, it may be cost-effective to build a multitude of cellular infrastructures, each serving a particular traffic type. The network resources (e.g., the radio channels) are then partitioned among the multitude of tiers. In general terms, we are interested in quantifying the cost reduction due to the multitier network design, as opposed to a single-tier network. Our study is motivated by the expected proliferation of personal communication services, which will serve different mobility platforms and support multimedia applications through a newly deployed infrastructure based on the multitier approach.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an architecture for onboard ATM switching. The constraints of the space environment and the associated delays (especially with geostationary satellites) create often conflicting requirements for the implementation of ATM via satellite. These requirements must be considered when designing onboard equipment. The article suggests that the use of MF-TDMA framing and of physical-layer scheduling as a preswitching stage allows for the use of standard switch fabrics onboard with additional fault tolerance and buffer mechanisms. The details of the scheduler and of the RF front end, including demodulation and demultiplexing, are presented as well as suitable switch fabrics and their performance/implementation impact. ATM is now widely considered the delivery medium for the broadband services of the future. This fact has also attracted the attention of the satellite community. Current satellite ATM trials have concentrated on trunking applications using available broadcast satellites. However, the US FCC filings for Ka band satellites, as well as Canadian W and European initiatives, have focused on a new generation of digital regenerative multibeam onboard processing satellites.",

The optimum soft decision metrics use channel state information to account for signal strength variations due to fading. The formulation for computing the optimum soft decision metrics is given for the general case in which the statistics of the additive noise on the channel is nonstationary. However, the formulation is applied to a more simple case in which the noise is assumed to be stationary. The results indicate that at moderate signal-to-noise ratios, the 2 dB advantage usually claimed for soft decision decoding over hard decision decoding on Gaussian channels is achievable on fading channel, with the rate 3/4 code used, if the channel state information is incorporated in the soft decision metrics.",

   "abstract": "The role of microwaves is discussed in achieving future wireless personal communications (FWPC) systems. An overview of the FWPC system is presented and the challenges to meet its demands are examined. Special attention has been paid in defining research challenges in the light of microwave perspectives. Among several research challenges, the key challenges are briefly described, such as propagation modeling, antenna diversity and millimeter waves. A description of their potentialities shows the state of the art of future wireless personal communications. It outlines some aspects of the prospective evolution of FWPC systems and expects to draw the research interest of the microwave community in the creation of a \"global village\".",

   "abstract": "As broadband multimedia services and wireless services become popular, there is growing interest in the industry to support ATM over a wireless link, and wireless access to fixed ATM networks. We focus on the internetworking of PCS and ATM networks, in which the air interface remains one of the PCS standards and the backbone is an ATM network with mobility support. It is desirable to minimize the impact of the internetworking and mobility support on the existing/emerging PCS and ATM specifications. A network architecture, a protocol reference model, and signaling protocols for PCS mobility support over fixed ATM networks are described. They are compared against other implementation alternatives and the trade-offs are discussed. Some performance results of the proposed architecture are also presented.",

   "abstract": "The development of the information society will require the introduction of high-capacity transport networks with high performance and low cost. There are currently two ACTS (Advanced Communications Technologies and Services program launched by the European Commission) projects addressing specifically the problem of trans-European optical transport networks using WDM (wavelength division multiplexing). Important issues addressed are the high capacity transmission on existing fiber infrastructure and the introduction of flexibility in the network through the use of optical cross-connects. If these networks become a reality, they could drastically change the evolution of both telecommunication and computer networking because of their transparency and the abundance of inexpensive bandwidth.",

This article quantifies this overhead by describing a benchmarking framework implemented in a reliable, portable, and easily expandable toolset designed to conduct measurements of well-defined parameters and performance metrics on equipment that is either isolated or connected to a live network. The usefulness of this toolset is then demonstrated in a test suite applied to assess call rates and connection establishment latency of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint ATM connections in the MAGIC, ATDnet, and AAI WANs, on the campus ATM LAN at NRL, and on individual switches in our laboratories.",

   "abstract": "A report is given on the results of a series of objective measurements conducted by COMSAT in a laboratory environment aimed at characterizing the narrowband performance of the ITU-T G.729 8 kb/s conjugate-structure algebraic code-excited linear prediction (CS-ACELP) speech coder. The test procedures followed ITU-T Recommendation G.720, \"Characterization of Low-Rate Voice Coder Performance with Non-Voice Signals\". It was concluded that the G.729 algorithm has excellent performance with narrowband signals in general (e.g., single tones and DTMF signals). As for Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) interregister signals, the G.729 CS-ACELP frequently failed to correctly identify SS5 digit 6 in a number of occurrences, using worst-case analysis equipment. This indicates that the SS5 performance of G.729 codecs in trunks where SS5 is used should be carefully measured before the network planner decides on its deployment. Great care should also be taken for tandem connections, since no test has been performed for these configurations.",

   "abstract": "This article describes a proposed network architecture for both the ground and space segments of a satellite network supporting multimedia services with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. The space segment proposal is geared toward a TDMA-based satellite network comprising many nongeostationary satellites, while the ground segment proposal does not put any restriction an the satellite network. The ground segment proposal is based on the new ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2) which we consider to have a major role to play in offering an efficient way to provide multimedia services over ATM networks. Indeed, it allows easy encapsulation of the complete set of media component sessions which forms a multimedia transaction into a single ATM virtual channel connection. An additional advantage of AAL2 is that it can run over any arbitrary slotted access system independent of the ATM format (i.e., without transporting the ATM cell headers). This is important for efficient interfacing of the ground and space segments. The space segment proposal aims at providing a robust, easily managed and controlled architecture to guarantee QoS by using a combination of connectionless and connection-oriented techniques. This is achieved by: defining a fixed logical network architecture (i.e., independent of the motion of the satellites); limiting the functionality of the switches in the sky; and using adequate addressing and routing procedures.",

A very important problem in fade countermeasure systems is the need to detect signal quality quickly and accurately. In fact, the countermeasure has to be initiated before the signal degradation effect an the bit error rate is detected by the user. This article presents an overview of different methods to evaluate signal quality, which are based on the availability of soft quantized levels of PSK demodulated signals at the receiver. It is shown that this class of methods has a good theoretical performance. Also, an innovative procedure is presented which adapts one of the methods to some existing hardware, and tunes up a set of parameters in order to compensate for the fact that the hardware is to same extent impaired.",

Magic WAND is investigating wireless ATM technology for customer premises networks in the framework of the Advanced Communications Technologies and Services (ACTS) program funded by the European Union. The MAC protocol, known as MASCARA, is a hub-based, adaptive TDMA scheme which combines reservation- and contention-based access methods to provide multiple access efficiency and quality-of-service guarantees to wireless ATM terminal connections sharing a common radio channel. The traffic scheduling algorithm is delay-oriented to meet the requirements of the various traffic classes defined by the ATM architecture. The results of the simulation of a number of scenarios are presented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

   "abstract": "The growing use of multimedia communication applications, with specific bandwidth and real-time delivery requirements has created the need for an integrated services Internet in which traditional best-effort datagram delivery can coexist with additional enhanced quality of service (QoS) delivery classes. Such classes provide data flows with QoS commitments with regard to bandwidth, packet loss, and delay through the reservation of network resources along the data path, which can be done using the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). This article is a tutorial on how RSVP can be used by end applications to ensure that they receive the end-to-end QoS that they require.",

   "abstract": "Comparing market estimates for wireless personal communication and considering proposals for wideband multimedia services with the existing spectrum allocations for these types of systems show that spectrum resource management remains an important topic in the near and distant future. In this article the authors start by presenting a quite general formulation of the radio resource management problem where the three key allocation decisions are concerned with waveforms (\"channels\"), access ports (or base stations), and, finally, with transmitter power. Some approaches to these problems found in the literature are reviewed. In particular, the principles of random channel allocation schemes, as found in frequency-hopping or direct-sequence CDMA systems, are compared with deterministic dynamic channel allocation schemes. The article closes by giving an outlook of some of the key problems in resource management in future wireless multimedia systems.",

   "abstract": "When the mechanisms of fading channels were first modeled in the 1950s and 1960s, the ideas were primarily applied to over-the-horizon communications covering a wide range of frequency bands. The 3-30 MHz high-frequency (HF) band is used for ionospheric communications, and the 300 MHz-3 GHz ultra-high-frequency (UHF) and 3-30 GHz super-high-frequency (SHF) bands are used for tropospheric scatter. Although the fading effects in a mobile radio system are somewhat different than those in ionospheric and tropospheric channels, the early models are still quite useful to help characterize fading effects in mobile digital communication systems. This tutorial addresses Rayleigh fading primarily in the UHF band. That affects mobile systems such as cellular and personal communication systems (PCS). Part I of the tutorial itemizes the fundamental fading manifestations and types of degradation.",

The paper itemizes the fundamental fading manifestations and types of degradation. Two types of fading, large-scale and small-scale, are described. Two manifestations of small-scale fading (signal dispersion and fading rapidity) are examined, and the examination involves two aspects: time and frequency. Two degradation categories are defined for dispersion: frequency selective fading and flat fading. Two degradation categories are defined for fading rapidity: fast and slow. A mathematical model using correlation and power density functions is presented. This model yields a symmetry to help view the Fourier transform and duality relationships that describe the fading phenomena.",

The main reason for this was to cover not only users at universities and laboratories (Mbone users) but also those at enterprises and homes (even dial-up users). Since the number of users who could access the Mbone were limited, SoftwareVision provided other users with the opportunity to participate in this exciting event. The event was broadcast all over the world, so some users, particularly those on the opposite side of the world, stayed at home (till very late at night) and could see and hear the conference by dial-up connections. The quality of the video was satisfactory enough for them to listen to what the speakers said and see the slides of the overhead projections. The accumulated number of users who accessed this two-day event was 353. This shows there is enough potential demand for remote participation in the conference. This broadcasting was initiated by the members of the IEICE (Institute of Electronics. Information, and Communications Engineers).",

   "abstract": "Discusses experiences of the authors in transmitting the proceedings of some events at IEEE GLOBECOM '96 in London, England, during November 17-22, 1996. Live video and audio of all the events in the Churchill Auditorium of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center were captured and transmitted, in real time, as well as stored and transmitted later, for remote participants in three continents, over the Internet. Two independent systems were used simultaneously, one supplied by researchers from NTT Laboratories in Japan and the other by researchers from University College London. The former system is based on a server model of distribution, while the latter is based on the use of network-level packet multicast. Both systems employ compression algorithms, so the network capacity requirement in each case was on the order of 100 kb/s to 200 kb/s total, thus enabling remote participants without very high-end network connectivity to take part. Receivers only need software for a PC running most popular versions of Windows or a UNIX workstation to be able to receive either type of transmission, or to retrieve the recorded sessions from NTT Laboratories servers. The multimedia transmission was carried over carefully engineered links that traversed many different subnet technologies, including point-to-point circuits, SMDS networks, ATM networks, and fast Ethernet switches. This was both to give a high level of assurance that the traffic would not experience too much interference from other traffic, and to ensure very low packet store and forward delays. The system ran for four days continuously, and was generally very successful.",

The current narrowband residential Internet access infrastructure using dial-up through the PSTN not only is too slow, but also leads to high service blocking probability. Hence, providing an \"always-on\" high-speed Internet access service has been viewed as the new killer application for residential broadband networks. Residential broadband Internet service design requires understanding of the networking requirements of broadband Internet applications. This article provides a framework for characterizing applications requirements in general, with special emphasis on Internet applications such as Web browsing. The author presents a classification of applications based on their networking requirements, and discusses the traffic and quality of service requirements for each application class.",

Satellites provide unique advantages such as remote coverage with rapid deployment, distance insensitivity, bandwidth on demand, immunity to terrestrial disasters, and offering broadband links. Satellite ATM networks will play an important role in the rapidly evolving information infrastructure.

The objective of this survey is to present the state of the art in satellite ATM networks and to point out open research problems. We explain the satellite ATM network architecture and cover the requirements and technical barriers for seamless integration of ATM and satellite networks. We describe the feasibility of the existing ATM cell transport methods, and deal with conventional and new satellite link access methods, and some error control schemes for the satellite environment. We then describe the problems of the proposed traffic and congestion control schemes, followed by the error performance of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Service-Specific Connection-Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) for the satellite ATM network. We present basic requirements and a possible architecture for local area-metropolitan area network (LAN-MAN) interconnection using satellite ATM and then discuss the requirements for multimedia services in satellite ATM networks.",

   "abstract": "CDMA has many benefits compared to TDMA and FDMA systems mainly because it is inherently self organizing. This article shows how the benefits of self organization can be extended to TDMA and FDMA systems also, and describes the results of research conducted by the authors. Self-organizing channel assignment not only increases the capacity and improves the call quality, but also obviates the need for frequency planning, which opens the door for innovative new services and technologies to be introduced into the operators' systems. This makes self-organization useful even in areas where operators are not yet facing capacity problems.",

   "abstract": "Traditionally, mobile operators have planned their networks to accommodate mobile terminals at ground level. Increasingly, mobile users communicate while stationary from within high-rise buildings. With mobiles operating at a variety of different heights and mobilities, plus the requirement to accommodate increasing teletraffic and multimedia services, there is a need to compact small cells into the three-dimensional city space. This article is concerned with using city buildings to act as electromagnetic molds that define the size and shape of each three-dimensional cell. Issues related to using these cells to form a mobile radio network are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Network protection and reconfiguration is becoming increasingly important in fiber optic communications systems. This is driven by the intense traffic and high cost of lost high-data-rate optical connections. Optical cross-connects at the nodes in transmission systems are developing rapidly in response. A key optical component required for these applications is an optical space switch. Since the required timescale of network reconfiguration at the optical level is on the order of 50 ms to prevent electrical intervention. The optical space switching speed must be approximately 5 ms or faster. The demand created by these applications has motivated the development of a solid state optical space switch based on a novel planar-waveguide technology. This planar integrated optics technology relies on the thermo-optic effect in specialized optical polymer materials and results in reliable optical space switches without moving parts to wear out. This article reviews the state of the art in solid state optical space switches based on thermo-optic polymers and applications of these switches in network communication systems. The same polymer-based planar waveguide technology used to make the solid state optical space switches of today provides the basis for WDM devices. Electro-optic modulators, and devices integrating several functions (space switching, wavelength multiplexing, light generation and detection) in one component in the years to come.",

   "abstract": "The growth of the global Internet, and of the World Wide Web in particular, has proposed a new cultural space, a channel for cultural communications where netizens exchange in new ways ideas and opinions that travel far in new directions. Memory is the basis for information organization and circulation; consequently memory organizers, such as libraries and museums, are metamorphosing their configuration, their structure, the services offered, while we are altering the idea we had of their meaning. The global Internet has changed the ways researchers carry on their information-intensive activities and seek emerging content in the document repositories. The evolution is still going on: the potentials will be converted into salient features, driven by approaches, springing from new and still fuzzy ideas and trends that take into account the global configuration of the Internet with the interrelationships among the different protagonists. This article is a visionary's fresco of the scenario where this evolution is taking place. With a description of current mechanisms for information managing in the Web, a comparative analysis of the hot points where R&amp;D is more active, and some specific proposals, the visionary argues for making the idealistic scenario an operational one. Topics discussed include indexing, cataloguing, document requests and the use of software agents.",

   "abstract": "A variety of signal processing techniques have been developed over the past 10 years to increase the bit rate of digital transmission through telephone loop twisted pairs. The ISDN basic rate access 2B1Q digital subscriber line (DSL) was the first technology of this type to be deployed commercially at 160 kb/s full-duplex transmission on a single twisted pair. Other transmitter/receiver circuits have been developed over the years that support symmetric and asymmetric data transmission from several hundreds of kilobits per second to several megabits per second using the 2B1Q line code in the case of HDSL and various modulation techniques (QAM, CAP, and DMT) in the case of ADSL. These more recent forms of xDSL circuitry have begun to be used to provide commercial Internet access. This article analyzes the system level considerations for using these technologies in the increasing complex loop network of telephone companies. A \"next generation\" of xDSL access system is proposed, and the requirements for such a system are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Effective end-to-end management of today's globalized heterogeneous corporate customer networks, a mixture of ATM WANs and ATM LANs, is essential for customers at the cutting edge of technology. ATM WAN and ATM LAN management systems generally have different management policies and management information models. Studies on the customer network management system (CNMS) to realize end-to-end customer network management have thus adopted the telecommunications management network (TMN) interoperability concept, which is based on CNM manager and agent interoperation. This article proposes an end-to-end customer network management method that realizes interoperation. In order to realize configuration management, fault management, and performance management, the CNM agent extracts the information needed by CNMS from the ATM transport network operations system and controls the operations system accordingly.",

   "abstract": "To introduce broadband interactive services in a fiber-coax CATV network with high splitting ratio, a high-density wavelength multiplexing upgrading strategy in combination with conventional TDMA techniques is presented. It features flexible network reconfiguration via wavelength reassignment at the fiber terminating network units, a high interactive services capacity per user, and improved network scalability. On the fiber part of the network the interactive channels are carried in baseband, time-multiplexed (in ATM) in a number of wavelength channels. The article gives an overview of the most distinctive characteristics of TOBASCO. The system architecture as well as the evolutionary upgrade path are presented. The implications of the flexible wavelength allocation scheme on the network topology and, in particular, dynamic assignment strategies are analyzed. Finally, the field trial to be carried out in Gent is discussed.",

For example, users will be asking for higher quality, greater functionality, and lower charges for high-speed, high-throughput data transfer. To respond effectively to the wishes of sophisticated and varied users, technology development must be pursued from the user's point of view. For this reason, research and development is being performed on middleware to open up network functions and make it possible for the user and network to cooperate with each other. This article discusses the development of major technologies for achieving an enhanced OCN (next-stage OCN) which should become a catalyst far the future multimedia network, and presents a future vision for the network.",

   "abstract": "Competition in deregulated telecommunication markets forces network operators to modernize their access networks-often called the \"last mile\" to the customer-to provide a mix of multimedia and traditional telecommunication services. Economics necessitate an evolutionary, step-by-step approach to migrate from the present access infrastructure-composed mainly of existing telephone networks and cable TV networks-to the ultimate information superhighway. At the end of the day, however, networks of different operators should provide interconnectivity for the same set of services. A system concept is described that drives access network technology toward a \"common platform\" with generic access methods, cognate routing and switching, and common, standardized communication protocols. Simulation results show some performance figures of the common platform concept. An implementation on a CATV network is presented as well.",

   "abstract": "This article deals with the ETSI computation model-the E-model-for evaluating speech communication quality in telephone networks. The reasons why such models are of interest for transmission planning of modern networks and the various subjective tests and customer surveys that must form the basis for the computation algorithms are discussed. Then a survey is given of models that are described in the ITU's documents. The structure of the new E-model and the various considerations taken in its development and verification are also discussed. Results from application of the E-model on typical connections agree well with results from other models and from published subjective tests. In particular, impairments caused by low-bit-rate codecs can be quite well predicted by the model, better than by the hitherto used methodology of \"quantizing distortion units.\" The E-model has also been used in the process of updating some of the ITU-T C-series Recommendations on transmission planning.",

Pan American will be a cost effective 7300 km trunk and branch undersea cable system with landings in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Aruba, and the United States. It will be configured into four logical rings that will automatically protect traffic in the rest of the network should a fault occur in any branch. Initially planned to operate at 2.5 Gb/s on a single wavelength, the rings can be stacked using wavelength division multiplexing to increase capacity as demand for international services to the region grows. A highly sophisticated network management system will operate, administer, and maintain the entire network from a centralized, secure location.",

This research was funded by the United Kingdom DTI-EPSRC project, \"Personal Communications LINK Project\" (PCP) under the title \"Wireless ATM LAN\", and carried out in collaboration with Symbionics Developments Ltd. of the United Kingdom. The article outlines the basic characteristics of ATM technology and sets the design objectives for the ATM WLAN. It proposes system architectures and protocol reference models (PRMs) for the establishment of ATM WLAN using IEEE 802.11 and HIPERLAN. The system architecture and PRM of an optimum design for ATM WLAN are presented along with the mechanism for mobility management and handover execution. Finally, it discusses the multiple access scheme adopted in the proposed ATM WLAN.",

   "abstract": "The concept of personal communication services (PCS) is only now beginning to take shape. In the past, PCS was described as services that were planned in certain frequency bands, such as in the 900 MHz narrowband licenses auctioned to the paging carriers (termed narrowband PCS) and the 1800 MHz frequencies auctioned for voice services. PCS has also been used as a synonym for certain technology standards like IS-136 TDMA, GSM (also known as DCS-1800), or IS-95 CDMA. However, the industry is now realizing that PCS is really a collection of voice and/or data services that meet the following minimum criteria: a single address or contact number to locate a user, the ability of the network to locate the recipient of the message, true universal coverage, and the independence of defined services from delivery mechanisms and technology. It can be argued that no single network or technology can address all these different attributes at an attractive price for all customers. This has caused existing service providers to invest in the internetworking of different wide area networks (WANs), establishment of standardized platforms for service creation, and development of content-aware smart applications. This article looks at several such developments in the context of the efforts underway at RAM Mobile Data USA LP to provide PCS using the Mobitex/sup R/ technology as its core. This article analyzes the Multi-Network Access Services (MNAS) which allow interconnection of several WANs, including satellite, circuit-switched cellular (CSC), public switched telephone network (PSTN), and paging networks. The approach is flexible enough to allow interconnection to additional networks that may be required in the future. This article also looks at the efforts on development of smart applications and services that are content-aware but independent of the underlying network technologies used. The proposed approach allows customers to use a single application to access similar services over multiple networks.",

   "abstract": "The wireless local loop (WLL) system is a local telephone system without wireline connection. It is believed to be a fast and cost-effective means to provide local phone service in rural areas and third world countries. WLL is a fixed radio communication system; narrowbeam antennas can be employed at both the base station and subscriber's side at high spots so that the propagation between base station and house is very close to free space propagation. This gives the WLL system many inherent advantages over the traditional cellular system, such as bigger coverage area, low power, reduced interference, higher capacity, no fast fading, and no handoff. In this article ideal multiple-tier hexagonal cells are used to derive the capacity of a CDMA WLL system. First, the reverse link interference from each tier to the center cell is calculated separately. Then, the interference ratio of reverse links in a WLL system is analytically derived as a function of total tier number. The result shows that interference from other cells is proportional to the beam width of the house antenna. The authors also found that tier number plays a vital role in system capacity in a free-space propagation (20 dB/dec) environment. At the extreme, the system capacity will drop to zero for an infinite-tier cell structure. A WLL simulator is also built to verify the authors' analytical solution.",

The successful modeler combines analytical or simulation skills with a deep understanding of the technology. In the emerging information networking environment comprising new technologies such as ATM, Internet, wireless, etc., and new services such as video, multimedia, data and personal communications services, the old paradigms of circuit-switched calls and Erlang distributions have been severely challenged. The confluence of the shifts in technologies and services along with the convergence of computing, telecommunications, consumer electronics, and electronic media industries, and the shift from a monopolistic to competitive business paradigm, has created a tremendously rich lode of fundamental problems that need to be addressed by teletraffic engineers. In this article the author describes the historical role of the teletraffic engineer, reviews several of the major paradigm shifts, and discusses some of the challenges facing the teletraffic community with an emphasis on modeling wireless communications systems.",

Experimental validation and verification is an essential component in the overall development of any novel technology. In this article the authors report the results of several controlled experiments measuring the transport of traffic in a wide area ATM network: the very high-speed backbone network service (vBNS). We illustrate how the characteristics of a tagged traffic stream change as the traffic traverses the network. Also, IP applications traffic is characterized at the ATM level. Lastly, we comment on the validity of theoretical assumptions often made in the research literature.",

   "abstract": "Traffic models are at the heart of any performance evaluation of telecommunications networks. An accurate estimation of network performance is critical for the success of broadband networks. Such networks need to guarantee an acceptable quality of service (QoS) level to the users. Therefore, traffic models need to be accurate and able to capture the statistical characteristics of the actual traffic. We survey and examine traffic models that are currently used in the literature. Traditional short-range and non-traditional long-range dependent traffic models are presented. The number of parameters needed, parameter estimation, analytical tractability, and ability of traffic models to capture marginal distribution and auto-correlation structure of the actual traffic are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The advances in photonic device technologies are bringing ultra-high-bit-rate networking-at speeds towards 100 Gb/s and beyond-much closer to practical reality. It is increasingly likely that in the longer term ultrafast optical time-division techniques-together with wavelength multiplexing-will be used in networks at all levels, from the transcontinental backbone to the desktop. Examples of devices include a subpicosecond clock source packaged inside a laptop personal computer and an OTDM switch on a single semiconductor chip, both produced at HHI. Advances similar to these make it possible now to envisage the use of OTDM techniques, not just in the highest layers of national and international networks, but also much closer to the user-such as the world-first demonstrations at BT Laboratories of a 40 Gb/s TDMA LAN and a 100 Gb/s packet self-routing switch for multiprocessor interconnection. Ultrafast networks might even provide the interconnection backplane inside future desktop routers and servers with massive throughput.",

A client using such databases would browse an old census database, look up references in an object-oriented database system, access descriptions and pictures over the Internet, or combine different information using NCSA Mosaic, Web, or backend databases. This article describes our experiences within the context of the DOK (distributed object kernel). This project aims to design a secure database middleware that enables users to effectively search, update, and combine information in distributed, heterogeneous environments. The DOK system uses security agents to maintain a DOK federation in a secure state. Different types of security agents are involved in the enforcement of security policies. Coordination agents are responsible for managing the whole federation, and delegate functions to more specific agents, called task agents. By delegating the access to information of local databases to database agents, task agents are able to control any access to a federation by using specifically designed security procedures.",

   "abstract": "Intranets are composed of a network of various devices, systems, and services supporting a wide variety of applications within an organization. Providing a secure, reliable, and efficient operating environment to support the organization's daily activities and its business is the most challenging task faced by operations and management staff today. Current management practices typically involve the use of separate, incompatible tools and techniques for managing networks, systems, and applications. What is needed desperately is a simple, uniform framework for managing not only networks but also systems and applications. Web-based management is a promising approach that can provide a truly integrated management solution. This article examines the key emerging technologies involved in Web-based management. The authors present an integrated architecture that can be used to manage all the networking and computing resources in an Intranet. Also presented are several specific examples where Web technology has been applied in managing different target resources for validating the architecture.",

   "abstract": "The Internet has fallen prey to its most successful service, the World Wide Web. The networks do not keep up with the demands incurred by the huge amount of Web surfers. Thus, it takes longer and longer to obtain the information one wants to access via the World Wide Web. Many solutions to the problem of network congestion have been developed in distributed systems research in general and distributed file and database systems in particular. The introduction of caching and replication strategies has proven to help in many situations; therefore, these techniques are also applied to the Web. Although most problems and associated solutions are known, some circumstances are different with the Web, forcing the adaptation of known strategies. This article gives an overview of these differences and currently deployed, developed, and evaluated solutions.",

   "abstract": "The very-high-speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored high-performance network service implemented by MCI. It was first implemented as an IP/ATM network with an OC-3 (155 Mb/s) infrastructure. The vBNS was activated on a test basis late in 1994, and the full network topology was on-line in early 1995. The NSF's high-performance connections program is now expanding the vBNS to reach more research and education (R&amp;E) institutions, and the vBNS backbone is currently being upgraded to OC-12 (622 Mb/s) speeds. The vBNS supports scientific applications between NSF-supported supercomputer centers (SCCs), directly connected research institutions, and research institutions that are served by other networks. The vBNS also provides a test environment for early deployment and evaluation of new internetworking technologies.",
