Examples of its application are presented. An additional benefit experienced with the use of this framework is a more consistent, disciplined analysis of service parameters, adding to the thoroughness with which service providers and customers alike assess the quality of communications services.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He suggests that by using these levels as a reference model, it might be possible to design human communication systems by factoring the design activity itself, thereby simplifying each step and producing a total system that transfers meaning efficiently between its users. He gives an example showing the use of a modularized reference model to design a system.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The DCS consists of a number of subsystems including circuit-switched voice and data, secure voice, packet data, and message processing networks. These networks utilize terrestrial, radio, and satellite transmission capabilities provided by both military and commercial carriers. The objectives of DCS system control are to provide maximum utilization of available DCS resources at all times; to maintain connectivity among critical users in all levels of stress; and to assist in reconfiguring and reconstituting the DCS whenever necessary. The discussion covers the current system; new requirements; the objective control structure; the operations support system; the approach used to integrate control of all subsystems; subregional control facilities; and implementation status.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

He addresses what he believes should be the main point of interest to the telephone companies when they are assured that QPSX will measure up to the public network requirements, namely, reliability and maintainability. He uses QPSX and FDDI to compare dual bus/dual ring reliability, showing that QPSX is less reliable. The original authors refute Dr. Rocher's comments regarding the reliability of QPSX, and they emphasize that the numerous other advantages of QPSX listed in their article stand undiminished.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The first data link would use the extant marine radiobeacon network (a medium-frequency system) and provide coastal coverage. The second data link would use pseudosatellites and provide additional lines of position as well as carry the differential correction.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The measured diversity improvement factors for digital radio against multipath dispersive fading are larger than those predicted by the existing analog radio model by at least one order of magnitude. Applications of these findings will lead to substantial savings in the cost for diversity protections for digital radio routes. These discoveries stimulated the development of new models of diversity improvement factors for digital radio and the development of the DRDIV computer program for engineering digital radio routes. Background information is given on multipath fading and diversity concepts, and a glossary of terms is included.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The advantages of store-and-forward (S/F) message transfer at the application layer and problems with existing systems are discussed. Current systems suffer from the limitation that if an intermediate message transfer agent (MTA), the entity responsible for storing and forwarding messages, cannot store a message in its entirety due to insufficient buffer space, then the transfer fails. A mechanism is introduced, called message fragmentation, to transfer messages too large to be completely stored on an intermediate MTA automatically and efficiently. In addition to letting a large message pass through the network, fragmentation improves performance in an S/F message-based system. Schemes developed for flow control, deadlock prevention, and buffer management in packet-switched networks are described, and their suitability for use in the message-handling environment is discussed. Several novel schemes for buffer management in the message-handling environment are presented. The EAN X.400-based S/F message-handling system developed at the University of British Columbia is briefly cited as an example.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

They discuss present network and technology trends, focusing on the reduction of the amount of electronic hardware, the disappearance of bandwidth efficiency as an important factor, and the state of the optical network today. They then turn to the future network and technology, showing how the central office can be dispensed with by operating the network on a radio mode, with each terminal assigned a specific frequency.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The concept is characterized by a service-independent architecture, integrated operations and service management systems, and programmable network entities. The full realization of this vision will require major advancements in the control software and signaling capabilities of existing network elements and operations systems, as well as the development of entirely new systems. Evolutionary strategies are discussed that can move the embedded network toward the ultimate goal and begin to achieve many of the benefits of the future vision in the near term. In particular, an intermediate intelligent network architecture called IN/1+, which could be implemented by 1991, is presented. IN/1+ is focused on circuit-switched capabilities and provides a significant movement toward the intended IN/2 architecture with a reasonable commitment of industry resources.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The IN/2 approach provides opportunities to implement new services while reducing the service introduction interval. The IN/1 architecture provides new-service introduction from a centralized point, allowing users throughout a wide geographic area to have access to the service simultaneously. The IN/2 concept extends the IN/1 approach and sharply reduces the new-service introduction interval. IN/2 applies the premise that multiple network services or service features can be constructed from a set of reusable network capabilities, which apply to many services and are therefore independent of a particular service application. An overview of the IN/2 architecture is presented, highlighting the key technical issues.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "A key factor in the transition of the existing network to an intelligent network (IN) environment is the need to partition the network intelligence and to ensure the coexistence of the embedded switch services with the externally controlled services. If the network intelligence can be defined by entities (e.g. access control and routing, connection control, basic call control, feature control, etc.), then the issue is how to manage their distribution over the evolving network elements (NEs). The authors focus on the early phases of the IN, during a 1991-2 time frame, when these features must interwork with the existing features (e.g. those within the Centrex service). They provide an overview of the features interactions and arbitration policies prevailing in today's network. They then describe the framework for both single- and multinode networked features models. The issues of call control distributed over the NEs of the IN are treated as extensions to the concepts and interfaces needed to provide networked services like areawide Centrex and private virtual networks. A model for offering IN/1+ services is described.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The general form of today's information services is discussed as a baseline for considering the future, and some key technological advances (including a broadband public-switched network) that are expected to greatly influence the continuing evolution of such services are listed. A description is given of a multimedia information services laboratory, consisting of a services testbed and application prototypes, which was constructed to illustrate and study important aspects of future services. The end-to-end performance requirements for these services are examined. Two examples are given to illustrate universal communications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

A systematic review is provided of the various techniques that can be used to perform the actual packet-by-packet routing operation at the upper layer, called the packet forwarding function. The function components of a routing system and its characteristics (responsiveness to changes in network state and degree of centralization) are discussed. Five routing techniques are then examined, namely source, directory, destination, global-path, and channel-link-path routing.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The issue of security, which is considered to be the final hurdle to be overcome in achieving interoperability of US Army computer systems, is discussed. In particular, the problem of transferring data across security boundaries is examined. The primary concern is to defend against unauthorized disclosure of high-side (e.g. top secret) data to low-side (e.g. secret) users. This might be caused by high-side errors, by malicious high-side software, or by active penetration from the low side. Other concerns include defending against modification or destruction of high-side data as well as denial of service to high-side users. Typical current solutions are described. The use of a security guard (also known as a security filter), i.e. a device or set of controls that mediates data transfers across security boundaries, to prevent leakage and penetration is examined. Lessons from past failures with guards and experience with an operational guard are discussed. Although military applications are addressed, the security issues raised are also thought to apply in the commercial sector.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The term workspace is used to denote a collection of such objects belonging to some application, and the software tools needed to access these objects. The major components of the system and the user interface are presented. A prototype implemented in C under 4.3BSD UNIX is discussed. The system is then related to and contrasted with other work on group collaboration. The suitability and shortcomings of UNIX as an operating system for building group collaboration software tools are assessed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Trunk scheduling is considered as a means to reallocate delay fairly among various traffic classes and thus reduce the overall network delivery delay of packets. Two service prioritization schemes to accomplish this in integrated services packet switching networks are discussed. These are based on either the total HOP distance (source-destination distance) between the packets' source and destination or that weighted by the packets' local delay at the switching node. Three types of servicing are considered, and the case of highest-priority servicing (head of the line) is studied in some detail. It is shown while the highest-priority servicing of total-distance prioritization can potentially lead to extensive end-to-end network delays for packets in the low-priority classes, the delay-weighted total-distance case results in a more fair and balanced treatment of all priority classes. The basic fast hardware architecture is presented for implementation of the delay-weighted total-distance-based service prioritization, which should make the discipline suitable for practical purposes.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Two classes of traffic are addressed, namely business-oriented low-rate-data traffic and bulk data traffic of corporate networks. Satellite access, throughput, and delay are considered. The size of the network population that can be served in an RA/TDMA environment is calculated. User protocols are examined. A typical VSAT business scenario is described.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) in a demodulated video signal is a function of the modulation index, which is proportional to the ratio of frequency excursion to input signal amplitude. The index is made as high as possible to obtain the best noise performance in blank areas without undue distortion due to RF spectrum truncation in busy areas. It is shown that this tradeoff can be markedly improved by adjusting the modulation index adaptively. This greatly improves the noise performance in just those areas where the noise would otherwise be most visible. Essential system concepts are presented, and the derivation of the adaptation factors is discussed. The principles are applied to a monochrome system and then the processing of color images is considered. Results of a computer simulation of two of the many possible implementations of this adaptive scheme are presented.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Before the early 1950s, work was done on quantitatively measuring phase distortion and equalizing lines with such distortion. The advent of the digital computer in the early 1950s and the resulting military and commercial interest in large-scale data processing systems led to interest in using telephone lines for transmitting digital information. The research efforts during this period and the resulting commercial products are described. The third era, during the 1970s was characterized by extensive research and technology advances. The discussion focuses on advances in timing recovery, adaptive filtering, semiconductor technology and modem design, and pulse-shaping filters. The late 1970s and early 1980s have seen the development of ultrahigh-speed modems. Coding for performance improvement and the development of 19.2 kb/s modems in this period are discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
