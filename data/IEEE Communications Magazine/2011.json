      "abstract": "In this article we present a survey on the technical challenges of future radio access networks beyond LTE-Advanced, which could offer very high average area throughput to support a huge demand for data traffic and high user density with energy-efficient operation. We highlight various potential enabling technologies and architectures to support the aggressive goal of average area throughput 25 Gb/s/km<sup>2</sup> in beyond IMT-Advanced systems. Specifically, we discuss the challenges and solutions from the controlling/ processing perspective, the radio resource management perspective, and the physical layer perspective for dense urban cell deployment. Using various advanced technologies such as interference mitigation techniques, MIMO, and cooperative communications as well as cross-layer self-organizing networks, we show that future urban wireless networks could potentially offer high-quality mobile services and offer an experience similar to the wired Internet.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a quantitative survey of mobile data traffic surge and a strategic solution to traffic offloading. As diverse mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers become ubiquitous, the explosive increase of data traffic in 3G cellular networks is a major concern for network operators. The rapid increase of mobile data traffic is unprecedented - a tenfold increase in a year is common. Thus, mobile data traffic offloading in 3G cellular networks is necessary. In this article we examine the effect of a network strategy deploying multiple wireless networks. We first discuss the relationship between the spread of smartphones and their contribution to the mobile data traffic surge. To see how mobile data traffic is transferred among different networks, we illustrate the traffic trend of the 3W (WCDMA, WIBRO, and WiFi) network in KT Corporation. Based on the composition of traffic, we also discuss functions and roles of the 3W networks in accessing mobile Internet. From these results, we show that deploying multiple wireless networks is an effective way of traffic offloading.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a channel model for broadband indoor Power Line Communications (PLC) is presented and discussed. The modeling approach is based on the physical structure of the electrical networks inside homes and small offices. The structure has been simplified to derive a parametric model that still preserves the essential behavior of these channels in the HF band (up to 30 MHz). The model provides realistic channels by setting values to a reduced number of physical parameters. In addition, statistical distributions for such parameters that allow generating ensembles of random channels are suggested. The validity of the generated channels is assessed by comparing their behavior to the one of channels measured at several indoor power networks. Hence, this model can be employed to estimate the performance of transmission techniques on PLC channels, to aid in the design of PLC systems or to make prototype conformance tests.",

      "abstract": "Context awareness, as one of the key techniques applied in ubiquitous computing, makes information technology invisible and seamless to people's daily living. As a result, numerous context frameworks have been developed for simplifying the development of context-aware applications by providing low-level context data operations such as acquisitions and simple aggregations in terms of APIs or toolkits. These frameworks are still falling short in requiring developers to explicitly deal with context-related tasks such as constraint enforcement in the application code. In this article, we present a framework to bridge the gap. More specifically, an application context model (ACM) is proposed for developers to specify their requirements on the context-related tasks. At application runtime, the ACM is instantiated for automatic context realization by the application context engine (ACE), which supports the full life cycle of each ACM instance (initialization, execution, and termination). We validate the concept of the framework through a case study, and present the experimental results based on the system prototype.",

      "abstract": "Network-based defense (NBD) and the all-IP network make authentication ever more important. However, a generally accepted and comprehensive authentication suite is lacking. This work is a step toward filling the gap. The article proposes a three-level framework for authentication in NBD tactical ad hoc networks. Hop-by-hop network-level authentication provides basic protection. End-to-end application-level authentication is included only when finer resolution is needed. The third level of authentication relates to physical node access. The framework may serve as a reference for authentication in other networks as well. An additional contribution is the approach used to derive the authentication framework, which has general relevance.",

The mobile communications industry is maturing. In order to remain competitive many operators now focus on reducing their capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX), by outsourcing some of their business activities and/or by sharing some network infrastructures. This article presents a possible evolution of the 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) and Quality of Service (QoS) architecture to better support Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) and more flexible CN sharing solutions. This goal is achieved with a clearer separation of the business roles (e.g. access and network providers) and the introduction of a Network Policy Function (NPF) for the management of the CN.",

      "abstract": "Self-Organizing Networks (SON) are currently being introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system as a key driver for improving the operation of wireless networks. Given that many challenges have been identified when moving from the SON concept to practical implementation, this article claims the suitability to gain insight into the problem by taking advantage of optimization mechanisms in live Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. From that perspective, this article outlines a roadmap from actual manual optimization toward the inclusion of SON concepts in future networks. In particular, an optimization framework is developed considering different stages that include the collection of inputs from different sources (network counters, measurement reports, drive tests), the tuning parameters to achieve optimization, and the optimization procedure itself. Even though the proposed framework is presented and evaluated for convenience in a UMTS context, it is rather generic and technology-agnostic and, therefore, it can be formulated as an initial reference for LTE selfoptimization use cases. The proposed framework is applied to a practical coverage optimization use case supported by data extracted from a real UMTS network in a European city, illustrating the capability to automatically identify a cell with sub-optimal coverage and to provide a solution to the problem. The extension of the case study to LTE is also analyzed. Finally, as a result of the lessons learned, the article makes a projection to the LTE context by identifying the key points to be solved for the materialization of a self-optimization procedure.",

      "abstract": "VLANs are widely used in today's enterprise networks to improve Ethernet scalability and support network policies. However, manuals and textbooks offer very little information about how VLANs are actually used in practice. Through discussions with network administrators and analysis of configuration data, we describe how three university campuses and one academic department use VLANs to achieve a variety of goals. We argue that VLANs are ill-suited to some of these goals (e.g., VLANs are often used to realize access control policies, but constrain the types of policies that can be expressed). Furthermore, the use of VLANs leads to significant complexity in the configuration of network devices.",

However, the concept has grown into multiple dimensions, encompassing sensor networks able to provide real-world intelligence and goal-oriented collaboration of distributed smart objects via local networks or global interconnections such as the Internet. Despite significant technological advances, difficulties associated with the evaluation of IoT solutions under realistic conditions in real-world experimental deployments still hamper their maturation and significant rollout. In this article we identify requirements for the next generation of IoT experimental facilities. While providing a taxonomy, we also survey currently available research testbeds, identify existing gaps, and suggest new directions based on experience from recent efforts in this field.",

However, these solutions tend to increase the frame delay of some stations. If these stations run delay-sensitive applications, e.g., VoIP and video conferences, their quality of service would be seriously degraded. In this article we introduce and classify the existing solutions. The frame delay of each type of approach is illustrated by analytical results. We also propose an adaptive approach to solve this delay issue. The proposed approach could accurately model the condition of each station and concurrently adjust multiple MAC parameters. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach not only achieves airtime fairness but also improves frame delay. Therefore, the proposed approach could be applied to improve the quality of service of multimedia applications over WLAN environments.",

      "abstract": "Wireless LAN radio interfaces based on the IEEE 802.11a standard have lately found widespread use in many wireless applications. A key reason for this was that although the predecessor, IEEE 802.11b/g, had a poor channelization scheme, which resulted in strangling adjacent channel interference (ACI), 802.11a was widely believed to be ACI-free due to a better channelization combined with OFDM transmission. We show that this is not the case. ACI does exist in 802.11a, and we can quantify its magnitude and predict its results. For this, we present minor modifications of a simple model originally introduced by that allow us to calculate bounding values of the 802.11a ACI, which can be used in link budget calculations. Using a laboratory testbed, we verify the estimations of the model, performing experiments designed to isolate the affected 802.11 mechanisms. This isolation was enabled by not using the wireless medium, and emulating it over cables and attenuators. Our results show clear throughput degradation because of ACI in 802.11a, the magnitude of which depends on the interfering data rates, packet sizes, and utilization of the medium.",

Due to the quality of service requirements of these applications, these distributed resources can be connected by a wavelength-routed optical network, allowing each application to get dedicated bandwidth. These networks are referred to as LambdaGrids. One important service provided in these networks is advance reservation. Applications need to coordinate the use of both grid resources and the network. Advance reservation allows these applications to reserve bandwidth in advance to guarantee availability. In this article, we discuss different networks and frameworks that support advance reservation of bandwidth.

      "abstract": "Reverberation chambers (RC) are a popular tool for laboratory wireless communication performance evaluation, and their standardization for Over-The-Air (OTA) measurements is underway. Yet, the inherent limitations of single-cavity RCs to emulate isotropic Rayleigh-fading scenarios with uniform phase distribution and high elevation angular spread put their representation of realistic scenarios into jeopardy. Recent advances in the last few years, however, have solved all these limitations by using more general mode-stirred reverberation chambers (MSC), wherein the number of cavities, their stirring and coupling mechanisms, and their software postprocessing algorithms is far from simple, representing a new era for wireless communications research, development, and over-the-air testing. This article highlights recent advances in the development of second-generation mode-stirred chambers for wireless communications performance evaluation.",

      "abstract": "As an ultimate broadband access solution for future Internet, the passive optical network (PON) brings many advantages such as cost effectiveness, energy savings, service transparency, and signal security over other last-/first-mile technologies. Over the past several years, we have witnessed significant development and deployment of time-division multiple access (TDMA) PONs such as IEEE 802.3ah Ethernet PONs (EPONs) and ITUT G.984 Gigabit PONs (GPONs) to provide high-quality triple-play services for residential users. However, future Internet applications, apart from triple-play service (e.g., peer-to-peer [P2P] social networking, online video sharing, grid computing, and mobile Internet), along with their unique traffic characteristics and huge bandwidth requirements, pose big challenges for current PON design and migration, which in turn are driving legacy TDMA PONs toward ultra-high-speed flexible next-generation PONs such as wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) PONs and optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) PONs, and/or a hybrid WDM/OFDM/ TDM PON.",

Since flexibility in this case comes at a price of computing resource overhead, we propose a conceptually simple though powerful framework for digital signal processing applications. The abstraction layer and operating environment (ALOE) is an open source execution environment for software- defined radios. It is essentially based on a hardware abstraction layer, a lightweight and time-driven software architecture, and a simple interface format. ALOE accounts for heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms. Its cognitive computing resource management capabilities enable flexible and dynamic management of SDR platforms and applications for distributed realtime execution of applications and dynamic reconfiguration of platforms.",

      "abstract": "We developed a user interface prototype for the Android smartphone, which recommends a number of applications to best match the user's context. To consider the user's context of use, we utilized 5 prototypical variables; time, location, weather, emotion, and activities. The developed system derives the best three recommended applications based on the results of supervised machine learning from such data sets. To consider the history of past context information, in addition to the current one, we developed a novel and effective probabilistic learning and inference algorithm named \"Spatiotemporal Structure Learning.\" By extending Na\u00efve Bayesian Classifier, the spatiotemporal structure learning can create a probability model which represents relationship between time-series contextual variables. We implemented a prototype system which shows the current context and the inferred recommendation of applications. For the prototype system, we developed an Android widget application for the user interface and a Java-based server application which learns structure from training data and provides inference results in real time. To gather training data and evaluate the proposed system, we conducted a pilot study which showed 69 percent accuracy in predicting the user's application usage. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of an adaptive user interface applied to a state of the art smartphone. We also believe that the suggested spatiotemporal structure learning can be applied to number of application areas including healthcare or energy problems.",

      "abstract": "The IP Flow Information Export protocol (IPFIX) is an IETF Proposed Standard for the export of information about network flows in IP networks. It is the logical successor to Cisco Net- Flow version 9, upon which it is based. The key innovations of IPFIX are the flexible definition of a network flow and the runtime description of record formats through templates based on a well defined, extensible information model. These allow IPFIX to export flow information from present as well as future networks, and make it applicable to network management beyond the network and transport layers. In this article, we describe the protocol, from its motivation and history through its design and implementation, and explore its deployment within a network monitoring research project.",

In this article, we reason why the wireless community should start looking at the 3-300 GHz spectrum for mobile broadband applications. We discuss propagation and device technology challenges associated with this band as well as its unique advantages for mobile communication. We introduce a millimeter-wave mobile broadband (MMB) system as a candidate next generation mobile communication system. We demonstrate the feasibility for MMB to achieve gigabit-per-second data rates at a distance up to 1 km in an urban mobile environment. A few key concepts in MMB network architecture such as the MMB base station grid, MMB interBS backhaul link, and a hybrid MMB + 4G system are described. We also discuss beamforming techniques and the frame structure of the MMB air interface.",

      "abstract": "Context enabled mobile applications are considered to provide a richer experience and to enhance the user interaction by acquiring information that allows the identification of the user's current situation. Modern context inference infrastructures can source, process and deliver user information. However, a commercialization towards a context service has still been prohibited by the need for global service coverage and accurate context identification. With the advent of Next Generation Networks, telecom operators can leverage All-IP networks to design external service interfaces that integrate a diverse set of sources and context inference processes that are easily scalable, extendable, and robust at the same time. This article presents a telecom operator service that supplies mobile applications with context information to illustrate how context infrastructures can leverage NGN capabilities. The article introduces an innovative context inference approach involving third Party applications within the inference process itself. This is done by structuring the ontology context model in layers of complexity and inferring particular context information via modules, which are designed in collaboration with third party developers. Furthermore, the service is compliant with state-of-the-art IP Multimedia Subsystem infrastructures and provides an interface that uses HTTP/SOAP and HTTP/REST communication as well as the Session Initiation Protocol of the IMS. A first proof of concept indicates an increased service adoption, a higher accuracy of context, and an increased robustness towards errors.",

The proposed solution bases on standardized NGN service enabler operation principles that allows for efficient in-service QoE estimation and optimization. QoE control is accomplished through context-based QoE modeling, the principal role of which is to provide a detailed description of the circumstances, under which the communication is established and by which the end-user's QoE is affected. Implementation results and findings confirm feasibility and efficient design of the QoE controller proposal as well as full compliance with the requirements for its deployment into real-world NGN environments.",

      "abstract": "Peer to Peer streaming (P2P-TV) applications have recently emerged as cheap and efficient solutions to provide real time streaming services over the Internet. For the sake of simplicity, typical P2P-TV systems are designed and optimized following a pure layered approach, thus ignoring the effect of design choices on the underlying transport network. This simple approach, however, may constitute a threat for the network providers, due to the congestion that P2P-TV traffic can potentially generate. In this article, we present and discuss the architecture of an innovative, network cooperative P2PTV application that is being designed and developed within the STREP Project NAPA WINE<sup>1</sup> Our application is explicitly targeted to favor cooperation between the application and the transport network layer.",

The official registered WINNER+ Independent Evaluation Group evaluated this proposal against ITU-R requirements. The first part of the article gives an overview of the ITU-R evaluation process, criteria, and scenarios. The second part is focused on the working method of the evaluation group, emphasizing the simulator calibration approach. Finally, the article contains exemplary evaluation results based on analytical and simulation approaches. The obtained results allow WINNER+ to confirm that the 3GPP LTE Release 10 &amp; Beyond (LTE-Advanced) proposal satisfies all the IMTAdvanced requirements, and thus qualifies as an IMT-advanced system.",

The retrieved 3D models act as the building components for the automatically constructed 3D scene. Two CCN-based applications are also described, which perform the query routing and similarity search on each node of the CCN network.",

The framework expands the traditional definition of Shannon capacity to incorporate notions of delay and outage. Novel tools are described for upper and lower bounding the network performance regions associated with these metrics under a broad range of assumptions about channel and network dynamics, state information, and network topologies. We also develop a flexible and dynamic interface between network applications and the network performance regions to obtain the best end-to-end performance. Our proposed framework for determining performance limits of wireless networks embraces an interdisciplinary approach to this challenging problem that incorporates Shannon Theory along with network theory, combinatorics, optimization, stochastic control, and game theory. Preliminary results of this approach are described and promising future directions of research are outlined.",

      "abstract": "Currently, a large number of activities on Internet redesign are being discussed in the research community. While today's Internet was initially planned as a datagram-oriented communication network among research facilities, it has grown and evolved to accommodate unexpected diversity in services and applications. For the future Internet this trend is anticipated to continue even more. Such developments demand that the architecture of the new-generation Internet be designed in a dynamic, modular, and adaptive way. Features like these can often be observed in biological processes that serve as inspiration for designing new cooperative architectural concepts. Our contribution in this article is twofold. First, unlike previous discussions on biologically inspired network control mechanisms, we do not limit ourselves to a single method, but consider ecosystems and coexisting environments of entities that can cooperate based on biological principles. Second, we illustrate our grand view by not only taking inspiration from biology in the design process, but also sketching a possible way to implement biologically driven control in a future Internet architecture.",

      "abstract": "Carrier aggregation is one of the key features for LTE-Advanced. By means of CA, users gain access to a total bandwidth of up to 100 MHz in order to meet the IMT-Advanced requirements. The system bandwidth may be contiguous, or composed of several non-contiguous bandwidth chunks that are aggregated. This article presents a summary of the supported CA scenarios as well as an overview of the CA functionality for LTE-Advanced with special emphasis on the basic concept, control mechanisms, and performance aspects. The discussion includes definitions of the new terms primary cell (PCell) and secondary cell (SCell), mechanisms for activation and deactivation of CCs, and the new cross-CC scheduling functionality for improved control channel optimizations. We also demonstrate how CA can be used as an enabler for simple yet effective frequency domain interference management schemes. In particular, interference management is anticipated to provide significant gains in heterogeneous networks, envisioning intrinsically uncoordinated deployments of home base stations.",

The nontrivial dynamics in channel quality and spatiotemporal spectrum availability call for new ways of spectrum allocation. In this article, we advocate that auction theory can play a decisive role in shaping this evolving landscape since auctions are agnostic to user utility functions, and can build versatile and lightweight allocation mechanisms. Starting from auction preliminaries, we discuss how various intrinsic features of spectrum markets can be addressed with a modified version of auctions.",

      "abstract": "Narrowband power line communication systems in the frequency range below 500 kHz may play an important role in building up a smart grid. In the last few years, many efforts have been made to characterize power line networks. However, there are few guidelines for translating these results into real-life applications, such as performance comparison of different NB-PLC systems with realistic channel conditions or investigation of PLC systems considering critical transmission channels. In this article we propose a topology-independent approach that covers the channel characterization, channel emulation, and performance evaluation of PLC systems with realistic channel conditions in the laboratory. A comparison of the modem performance measured under real channel conditions with the performance obtained with the emulated channel conditions verifies the accuracy of the channel emulation and the correctness of the proposed approach.",

This prompted an outpouring of research work related to CR, including the publication of more than 30 special issue scientific journals and more than 60 dedicated conferences and workshops. Although the theoretical research is blooming, with many interesting results presented, hardware and system development for CR is progressing at a slower pace. We provide synopses of the commonly used platforms and testbeds, examine what has been achieved in the last decade of experimentation and trials relating to CR, and draw several perhaps surprising conclusions. This analysis will enable the research community to focus on the key technologies to enable CR in the future.",

In replying to the comments, the original author notes that he explained how his work informed the technology of the ARPANET as well as its timing relative to that of Paul Baran's. Prior to the writing of Davies' posthumous article, he contacted the author about these topics, and did respond accordingly.

However, the lack of an IP-based network architecture precluded sensor networks from interoperating with the Internet, limiting their real-world impact. Given this disconnect, the IETF chartered the 6LoWPAN and RoLL working groups to specify standards at various layers of the protocol stack with the goal of connecting low-power and lossy networks to the Internet. We present the standards proposed by these working groups, and describe how the research community actively participates in this process by influencing their design and providing open source implementations.",

It also proposes the priorities of the post-disaster network planning and construction, as well as a study on the future-oriented disaster countermeasures of networks and technologies. An earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale struck Wenchuan County of Aba Prefecture of Sichuan Province at 2:28:04 pm of May 12, 2008. The terrible catastrophe posed an all-round test to China in terms of disaster management, a test not only on the emergency response capability of all government departments, but also on the abilities of the whole society and ordinary citizens to deal with a catastrophe. It especially put the emergency capability and fast response capability of the communication sector, the Life Line, to a severe test.",

      "abstract": "A new network architecture for the Internet needs ingredients from three approaches: information- centric networking, cloud computing integrated with networking, and open connectivity. Information-centric networking considers pieces of information as first-class entities of a networking architecture, rather than only indirectly identifying and manipulating them via a node hosting that information; this way, information becomes independent from the devices they are stored in, enabling efficient and application- independent information caching in the network. Cloud networking offers a combination and integration of cloud computing and virtual networking. It is a solution that distributes the benefits of cloud computing more deeply into the network, and provides a tighter integration of virtualization features at computing and networking levels. To support these concepts, open connectivity services need to provide advanced transport and networking mechanisms, making use of network and path diversity (even leveraging direct optical paths) and encoding techniques, and dealing with ubiquitous mobility of user, content and information objects in a unified way.",

      "abstract": "This work addresses the fundamental problem of the trade-off between resource efficiency and user fairness in wireless networks that use opportunistic radio resource allocation. The concept of managing the trade-off by controlling the system fairness index is applied. In order to do that, two adaptive utility-based resource allocation frameworks consisting of subcarrier assignment and power allocation algorithms are proposed. These frameworks are named utility-based alpha-rule and beta-rule, and are suitable for non-real-time and real-time services, respectively. Not only can both frameworks be designed to work as wellknown classic policies found in the literature, but also as adaptive policies, which are able to meet a desired system fairness target. System level simulations show that the proposed frameworks are powerful tools to the network operator, since they can decide in which trade-off point of the efficiency-fairness plane they want to operate the system.",

A cooperating set of antennas can be collocated at a common cell site or distributed across multiple sites. As such, MUMIMO can be applied to a wide variety of architectures ranging from traditional cellular to more elaborate intertwined cooperative designs. We consider examples of such MU-MIMO architectures, and study the impact the scheduling criterion, cell density, and coordination can have on the average and cell edge user rates across different designs. Importantly, MU-MIMO has inherent physical layer overheads, which, as the examples illustrate, depend on the degree of coordination and the architecture. Such overhead considerations are very important in assessing net rates and, depending on the scenario, can motivate designs using less cooperation.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative communication has been shown as an effective way to exploit spatial diversity to improve the quality of wireless links. The key feature of cooperative transmission is to encourage single-antenna devices to share their antennas cooperatively such that a virtual and distributed antenna array can be constructed, and, as a result, reception reliability can be improved and power consumption can be reduced significantly. With better understanding of such a physical layer technique, it becomes critically important to study how the performance gain of cooperative diversity at the physical layer can be reflected at the networking layer, thus ultimately improving application performance. This article presents an overview of network performance in cooperative wireless networks.",

Interference can be exploited or mitigated by cooperation between sectors or different sites. Significant gains can be shown for both the uplink and downlink. A range of technical challenges were identified and partially addressed, such as backhaul traffic, synchronization and feedback design. This article also shows the principal feasibility of COMP in two field testbeds with multiple sites and different backhaul solutions between the sites. These activities have been carried out by a powerful consortium consisting of universities, chip manufacturers, equipment vendors, and network operators.",

It entails a holistic approach, supporting content manipulation capabilities that encompass the entire content life cycle, from content publication to content resolution and, finally, to content delivery. CURLING provides to both content providers and customers high flexibility in expressing their location preferences when publishing and requesting content, respectively, thanks to the proposed scoping and filtering functions. Content manipulation operations can be driven by a variety of factors, including business relationships between ISPs, local ISP policies, and specific content provider and customer preferences. Content resolution is also natively coupled with optimized content routing techniques that enable efficient unicast and multicast- based content delivery across the global Internet.",

The system performance, in terms of bit error rate, outage probability, and achieved spectral efficiency, depends on constellation signaling, applied diversity, and channel estimation. Resources dedicated to channel estimation and feedback traffic contribute to the overall system and network energy consumption, and the resulting CO<sub>2</sub> emission. We consider the trade-offs among different methodologies and parameters toward an energy-efficient green communication system design. Below, we discuss the degrees of freedom in the design of communications systems with imperfect channel estimation and diversity, and investigate their energy saving options. We present the case studies of single- and multicarrier systems applying both margin-adaptive and rate-adaptive pilot-assisted transmission.",

      "abstract": "The explosive demand for wireless data services that followed the introduction of application phones continues to create significant challenges for mobile operators. Measurement campaigns indicate that the consumption of wireless network capacity follows a power law where 20 percent of the users consume more than 80 percent of capacity. This creates unfairness among users in terms of the data volume they are allowed to consume and, more important, during congested periods of time it degrades the quality of experience of all the users. As a response, many operators are attempting to control demand by gradually moving away from unlimited data plans with the introduction of volume caps and tiered charging. Many operators throttle the heavy users after they have exceeded their cap, and consider doing the same during times of congestion. This article evaluates the concept of deprioritization of heavy users in wireless networks for congestion management, the difference between deprioritization and throttling, and the enabling technologies to implement the feature in real-world networks.",

However, existing systems rely on either the vehicular ad hoc network or application-layer peer-to-peer protocols over a broadband wireless network suffering from low lookup success rate, high lookup latency, and maintenance overhead of the P2P network. This article proposes a two-tier VANET/P2P architecture that exploits both VANET and P2P technology. In the low tier, vehicles form a VANET via intervehicle communication to exchange traffic information. On top of the VANET, a portion of the vehicles further establish a P2P overlay through a broadband wireless infrastructure to mitigate the disconnectivity problems of the VANET. Simulation results demonstrate that the two-tier architecture can significantly improve the lookup success rate compared to the single-tier VANET systems while reducing lookup latency and maintenance overhead compared to the single-tier P2P systems.",

      "abstract": "Multiparty networked applications, which are gaining interest in areas as diverse as online games, e-learning, e-health, and collaborative work, tend to depend on a set of common functions. In conventional IP networks, these shared functions require application-specific servers, leading to scale diseconomies and complicating interoperability. The IP Multimedia Subsystem addresses this by incorporating basic services called service enablers, which can be used as building blocks to facilitate application development. This article discusses our experience creating innovative enablers for IMS networks, and combining them into new multimedia applications. An enabler-centric process is described, and the configuration of a development IMS network is explained, with suggestions on how to replicate this architecture with freely available components. Following these principles, we designed and implemented a series of novel group-centric enablers exploiting the advantages of group management, which we describe in detail. A use case made possible by these enablers is shown, consisting of an e-health scenario for remote medical visits. We reflect on the advantages and challenges introduced by this development methodology, and provide insight on how a project of this nature should be approached.",

      "abstract": "A wireless network allows multiple nodes to share a set of available resources for data transmission. The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to achieve their individual objectives or a group objective. Game theory is a mathematical tool developed to understand the situations of conflict among rational entities. In this article, we consider the applications of game theory to address the problem of distributed radio resource allocation in wireless networks under uncertainty, where an individual wireless node has to make a decision without having complete information about the other nodes in the network. In particular, a noncooperative game model with incomplete information is our focus. First, different approaches to solve the distributed radio resource allocation problem under uncertainty are reviewed. Then different game theoretic approaches to resource allocation in wireless networks and related work in the literature are presented. Application of a Bayesian game is then discussed to solve the distributed resource allocation problem. To this end, we provide an example to illustrate the application of a Bayesian game-theoretic model to solve the distributed bandwidth sharing problem among multiple mobile nodes competing for the shared bandwidth from a wireless access point. In this case, a mobile node is unable to completely observe other mobile nodes' behavior (e.g., speed of movement, bandwidth demand). A distributed algorithm is proposed to obtain the bidding strategy of the mobile nodes for bandwidth auction in this game model. The Bayesian Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a comprehensive analysis of dynamic spectrum access operational parameters in a typical hidden node scenario with protected wireless microphones in the TV white space. We consider all relevant effects and use an analysis framework that properly combines probabilistic technical factors to provide specific policy recommendations including the exclusion zone distances and the sensing-based DSA threshold detection levels. First, man-made noise measurements were taken in different locations and the amount of interference from man-made noise in potential wireless microphone channels was analyzed. Data collection results show that man-made noise levels can be up to 30 dB above the thermal noise floor. Furthermore, indoor-to-outdoor path loss measurements were conducted to determine the required exclusion distance for DSA-enabled TV band devices to ensure reliable wireless microphone operation in a typical application. The results show that the required exclusion zone can be safely and conservatively set at around 130 m when the results from man-made noise measurements and wireless microphone propagation measurements are used. Additionally, we developed a simulation to determine the required DSA sensing threshold levels for impairment-free wireless microphone operation. An indoor-to-outdoor path loss model was created based on the above path loss measurement results. This statistical path loss model was used to determine the received signal level at TV band devices and the interference level at the wireless microphone receiver. Our results show that the sensing threshold can be set at around -110 dBm (in a 110 kHz channel) for impairment- free wireless microphone operation when man-made noise and representative propagation models are used.",

The primary motivations of this system are to enhance the bandwidth, split ratio, and loss budget of existing PONs, without mandating the replacement of the ONU and passive optics. The technical issues to be overcome in DSM-PON are considered, including management of the ONUs' spectral distribution and various filter designs. Several system applications of the scheme are suggested that have good practical and economic benefits.",

Engineers identified pulse code modulation, PCM, as offering a robust solution to the problem and launched a system development effort in 1956. Some difficult technical problems were identified; the solutions were found and incorporated into a new system design. The product was T-Carrier, which was introduced into service in 1962. This new application of PCM was highly successful and the technology was licensed to the independent telephone industry. The race toward an all-digital network of digital transmission and switching was off and running.",

      "abstract": "There is growing recognition that we are rapidly approaching the physical capacity limit of standard optical fiber. It is important to make better use of optical network resources to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic demand. One promising way is to introduce elasticity and adaptation into the optical domain through more flexible spectrum allocation, where the required minimum spectral resources are allocated adaptively based on traffic demand and network conditions. In this article, we discuss elastic and adaptive optical networks from the perspective of future standardization. We first overview the architecture, enabling technologies, and benefits of elastic and adaptive optical networks with the new concept of an optical corridor. We then present possible adoption scenarios from current rigid optical networks to elastic and adaptive optical networks. We discuss some possible study items that are relevant to the future standardization activities. These items include optical transport network architecture, structure and mapping of the optical transport unit, automatically switched optical network/generalized multiprotocol label switching control plane issues, and some physical aspects with possible extension of the current frequency grid.",

These important changes open up exciting opportunities for cognitive radio to enable and support a variety of emerging applications, ranging from smart grid, public safety and broadband cellular, to medical applications. This article presents a high-level view on how cognitive radio (primarily from a dynamic spectrum access perspective) would support such applications, the benefits that cognitive radio would bring, and also some challenges that are yet to be resolved. We also illustrate related standardization that uses cognitive radio technologies to support such emerging applications.",

In this highly demanding and dynamic context, new frameworks and (meta-) architectures for supporting experimentation are proposed, aiming at discovering how existing and emerging testbeds and experimental resources can be put together in such a way that testing and experimentation may be carried out according to specific requirements (industry, academia, etc.). The work presented in this article addresses a number of the fundamental principles and their corresponding technology implementations that enable the provisioning of large-scale testbeds for testing and experimentation as well as deploying future Internet platforms for piloting novel applications. The proposed concepts and architecture of Panlab, a pan-European testbed federation, aspires to facilitate and support user needs in these new areas.",

      "abstract": "With advances in computing technologies and active user participation through smart devices such as the iPhone and Android, user needs are becoming varied and complex. It is quite natural, then, that a single Web service may not be sufficient to fully satisfy the diverse goals of users in their daily lives. A set of cohesively connected Web services/mashups may be able to deal with these goals. An increasing number of open APIs can facilitate various types of service compositions with users as the service creators. Recently, Internet, telecommunications, and third-party providers have opened their services to the public in the form of open APIs, a trend following the Web 2.0 paradigm. However, most service creation environments do not have sufficient knowledge (particularly, available services and their functionality) to support service creation by users. The problem of knowledge scarcity is that users may have difficulty in finding relevant open APIs for a given situation, finally resulting in rather straightforward types of service. In this article we present two kinds of collective intelligence for user-driven service creation: the user's own experiences in service composition, and activity knowledge from the web. These collective intelligence types will aid in creating enduser service compositions by enforcing knowledge support in terms of user experiences and activity-aware functional semantics, and will finally accelerate the development of various kinds of converged applications. Using the beneficial roles of collective intelligence as key enablers of future service creation environments, this article also shows a new potential for user-driven composite services within the next few years.",

      "abstract": "The Internet, undoubtedly, is the most influential technical invention of the 20th century that affects and constantly changes all aspects of our day-to-day lives nowadays. Although it is hard to predict its long-term consequences, the potential future of the Internet definitely relies on future Internet research. Prior to every development and deployment project, an extensive and comprehensive research study must be performed in order to design, model, analyze, and evaluate all impacts of the new initiative on the existing environment. Taking the ever-growing size of the Internet and the increasing complexity of novel Internet-based applications and services into account, the evaluation and validation of new ideas cannot be effectively carried out over local test beds and small experimental networks. The gap which exists between the small-scale pilots in academic and research test beds and the realsize validations and actual deployments in production networks can be bridged by using virtual infrastructures. FEDERICA is one of the facilities, based on virtualization capabilities in both network and computing resources, which creates custom-made virtual environments and makes them available for Future Internet Researchers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research projects that have been using the virtual infrastructure slices of FEDERICA in order to validate their research concepts, even when they are disruptive to the test bed\u2019s infrastructure, to obtain results in realistic network environments.",

      "abstract": "Energy consumption is becoming an increasingly important issue throughout the community. For network operators in particular it is a concern as networks expand to deliver increasing traffic levels to increasing numbers of customers. The majority of the energy used by the Internet today is consumed in the access network, and this will continue to be the case for the short-to-mid- term future. Access technologies should thus be a prime focus for energy use mitigation. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of energy consumption in current and future access networks. We present the energy consumption of DSL, HFC networks, passive optical networks, fiber to the node, point-to-point optical systems, UMTS (W-CDMA), and WiMAX. Optical access networks are the most energy efficient of the available access technologies.",

This article reviews one such approach of applying a common communication technique, equalization, to correct for nonlinear distortions in analog circuits, which is analogized as non-ideal communication channels. The efficacy of this approach is showcased by a few latest advances in data conversion and RF transmission integrated circuits, where unprecedented energy efficiency, circuit linearity, and post-fabrication adaptability have been attained with low-cost digital processing.",

Such upgrade options must consider several technical and cost factors for evolution toward a shared multiple-channel PON using Wavelength- Division Multiplexing (WDM). WDM can facilitate the seamless upgrade of PONs, since capacity can be increased by adding new wavelength channels. We study the requirements for optimal migration toward higher bandwidth per user, and examine scenarios and cost-effective solutions for PON evolution.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we present a feasibility analysis for performing vehicular dynamic spectrum access across vacant television channels via a queueing theory approach. In this study, we model the vacant TV channels as a multiserver, multipriority, preemptive queue. Queueing theory has been extensively employed in the open literature to model multiple access architectures as well as analyze network performance in both wired and wireless communication frameworks. On the other hand, to the best of the authors' knowledge, not many researchers have tried to resort to a queueing theory approach to analyze dynamic spectrum access networks on a system level, including the specific case of vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA). Leveraging previously reported quantitative measurements obtained from a wireless spectrum measurement campaign conducted along a major interstate highway (I-90) located in Massachusetts, we modeled vacant TV channels as a multiserver queueing system in which available servers represent vacant TV channels. The servers become unavailable from the perspective of a vehicle in a time/location-varying fashion such that they represent spatially occupied TV channels. Both M/M/m and M/G/m models are employed to evaluate the probability that a vehicle finds all channels busy, as well as to derive the expected waiting times. We also consider cases where there are multiple priority classes of service requests such as a channel request by a first--responder vehicle.",

      "abstract": "Real-time services are very challenging for current network infrastructures. One of these services is online gaming, which has acquired more importance in the last years. The quality experienced by users could be improved by the use of a smarter network, which includes some proxies near the players in order to transfer intelligence from the game server to network borders. Proxies have been largely used for other services, such as web browsing and VoIP. First Person Shooters are a popular genre of online games that generate high rates of small packets. This issue becomes important in some scenarios where many flows of a game share the same path, as would happen between a proxy and the central server of a game. These flows could be multiplexed to improve efficiency by reducing packet overhead, thus allowing a bigger number of players to share the same link. A method named Tunneling, Compressing, and Multiplexing (TCM) has been proposed to multiplex these flows. In this article, this method has been tested using the traffic of eight popular First Person Shooters. The method has shown its ability to achieve bandwidth savings of about 30 percent for IPv4 and above 50 percent for IPv6 for all the games. The added delay and jitter are small enough to not annoy players.",

However, as energy saving and environmental protection become global demands and inevitable trends, wireless researchers and engineers need to shift their focus to energy-efficiency-oriented design, that is, green radio. In this article, we propose a framework for green radio research and integrate the fundamental issues that are currently scattered. The skeleton of the framework consists of four fundamental tradeoffs: deployment efficiency-energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency-energy efficiency, bandwidth-power, and delay-power. With the help of the four fundamental trade-offs, we demonstrate that key network performance/cost indicators are all strung together.",

      "abstract": "Narrowband power line communications (NB-PLC) systems operating in the frequency range 3-500 kHz were developed and used in the past few decades for telecommunications, metering, control, and automation. Recently, OFDM-based NB-PLC solutions known as G3 and PRIME came to the market after a long monopoly of single-carrier technologies, offering higher bit rates, robustness, and flexibility, which are vital for smart grid applications. However, it was realized that an international standard is important to ensure worldwide interoperable products and avoid market fragmentation. In the beginning of 2010, the IEEE Standards Association and ITU-T started standardization of NBPLC technologies based on OFDM, launching the P1901.2 and G.hnem projects, respectively. This article gives a technical overview of the ITU-T G.hnem standard, which defines a unified NB-PLC OFDM-based technology targeting multiple smart grid applications: smart metering, distributed automation, in-home energy management, generic home automation, car charging, and others, using IPv6 as the main networking protocol. ITU-T Recommendations G.9955 (G.hnem physical layer) and G.9956 (G.hnem data link layer) were consented for approval in February 2011; their final approval is expected in December 2011.",

      "abstract": "Machine-to-machine communications is characterized by involving a large number of intelligent machines sharing information and making collaborative decisions without direct human intervention. Due to its potential to support a large number of ubiquitous characteristics and achieving better cost efficiency, M2M communications has quickly become a market-changing force for a wide variety of real-time monitoring applications, such as remote e-healthcare, smart homes, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. However, the flourishing of M2M communications still hinges on fully understanding and managing the existing challenges: energy efficiency (green), reliability, and security (GRS). Without guaranteed GRS, M2M communications cannot be widely accepted as a promising communication paradigm. In this article, we explore the emerging M2M communications in terms of the potential GRS issues, and aim to promote an energy-efficient, reliable, and secure M2M communications environment. Specifically, we first formalize M2M communications architecture to incorporate three domains - the M2M, network, and application domains - and accordingly define GRS requirements in a systematic manner. We then introduce a number of GRS enabling techniques by exploring activity scheduling, redundancy utilization, and cooperative security mechanisms. These techniques hold promise in propelling the development and deployment of M2M communications applications.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of different wireless technologies has led to fragmentation of interfaces and APIs that are used to control and manage air interfaces and wireless links. The emergence of new networking and application concepts that support increasingly heterogeneous access methods, especially when combined with future cognitive radio technologies, significantly increase the already high complexity of development projects and software architectures. Dissimilar wireless interfaces also complicate the development of middleware components for higher layers of the protocol stack. In this article we present a new generic interface and API architecture that has been developed and prototyped in several different wireless platforms to address these problems. We introduce the basic framework of the architecture, and explain how generic and open interfaces can significantly lower development and deployment costs. The developed interface architecture can be seen as a lower level middleware, or as an enabling technology to implement different technology transparent network middlewares. We also briefly comment about prototyping and standardization status of technology.",

In response to this observation the Mobile Virtual Centre of Excellence (VCE) Green Radio project was established in 2009 to establish how significant energy savings may be obtained in future wireless systems. This article discusses the technical background to the project and discusses models of current energy consumption in base station devices. It also describes some of the most promising research directions in reducing the energy consumption of future base stations.",

      "abstract": "Mobile application processors are soon to replace desktop processors as the focus of innovation in microprocessor technology. Already, these processors have largely caught up to their more power hungry cousins, supporting out-oforder execution and multicore processing. In the near future, the exponentially worsening problem of dark silicon is going to be the primary force that dictates the evolution of these designs. In recent work, we have argued that the natural evolution of mobile application processors is to use this dark silicon to create hundreds of automatically generated energy-saving cores, called conservation cores, which can reduce energy consumption by an order of magnitude. This article describes GreenDroid, a research prototype that demonstrates the use of such cores to save energy broadly across the hotspots in the Android mobile phone software stack.",

In this article, we first identify the fundamental challenges in home M2M networks. Then we present the architecture of home M2M networks decomposed into three subareas depending on the radio service ranges and potential applications. Finally, we focus on QoS management in home M2M networks, considering the increasing number of multimedia devices and growing visual requirements in a home area. Three standards for multimedia sharing and their QoS architectures are outlined. Cross-layer joint admission and rate control design is reported for QoS-aware multimedia sharing. This proposed strategy is aware of the QoS requirements and resilience of multimedia services. Illustrative results indicate that the joint design is able to intelligently allocate radio bandwidth based on QoS demands in resource-constrained home M2M networks.",

In future networks, it is anticipated that network entities such as routers will be equipped with in-network storage due to the trend of ever decreasing storage cost. In this article, we propose a novel content delivery architecture called ISP-centric content delivery (iCODE) by which an ISP can provide content delivery services as well. iCODE can provide efficient content delivery services since an ISP can cache contents in routers with storage modules considering traffic engineering and the locality of the content requests. Compared to CDN and P2P systems, iCODE can offer reduced delivery latency by placing the contents closer to end hosts, and incentives to ISPs by reducing inter- ISP traffic and allowing traffic engineering. We also discuss the technical and business issues to realize the iCODE architecture.",

      "abstract": "This article sheds light on communication needs of evacuees in shelters during a post-disaster period and advocates that it is essential to develop a completely new communication service for those in shelters to maintain communication channels with those outside shelters as well as with those in other shelters. We then present assumptions and requirements in developing such service and show a service and system concept, termed Shelter Communication System. SCS is composed of a computer (termed Shelter Server) connected to the Internet and a set of personal computers (termed shelter PCs), one in each shelter, also connected to the Internet via an appropriate Internet access connection such as High Speed Packet Access. Shelter Server and Shelter PCs cooperatively provide a message communication service for those in shelters and those outside shelters. A prototype of SCS is presented to demonstrate feasibility of SCS. A simple evaluation shows that SCS potentially provides a message communication service for enormous number of evacuees in shelters in the case of large-scale disasters and surpasses other message communication services such as cellular phone mail and facsimile.",

      "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks enable communications between clouds of mobile devices without the need for a preexisting infrastructure. One of their most interesting evolutions are opportunistic networks, whose goal is to also enable communication in disconnected environments, where the general absence of an end-to-end path between the sender and the receiver impairs communication when legacy MANET networking protocols are used. The key idea of OppNets is that the mobility of nodes helps the delivery of messages, because it may connect, asynchronously in time, otherwise disconnected subnetworks. This is especially true for networks whose nodes are mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) carried by human users, which is the typical OppNets scenario. In such a network where the movements of the communicating devices mirror those of their owners, finding a route between two disconnected devices implies uncovering habits in human movements and patterns in their connectivity (frequencies of meetings, average duration of a contact, etc.), and exploiting them to predict future encounters. Therefore, there is a challenge in studying human mobility, specifically in its application to OppNets research. In this article we review the state of the art in the field of human mobility analysis and present a survey of mobility models. We start by reviewing the most considerable findings regarding the nature of human movements, which we classify along the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of mobility. We discuss the shortcomings of the existing knowledge about human movements and extend it with the notion of predictability and patterns. We then survey existing approaches to mobility modeling and fit them into a taxonomy that provides the basis for a discussion on open problems and further directions for research on modeling human mobility.",

      "abstract": "The recent proliferation of smartphone-based mobile Internet services has created an extraordinary growth in data traffic over cellular networks. This growth has fostered interest in exploring alternatives to alleviate data congestion while delivering a positive user experience. It is known that a very small number of users and applications cause a big percentage of the traffic load. Hence, adopting smarter traffic management mechanisms is one of the considered alternatives. These mechanisms allow telecom operators to move selected IP data traffic, for instance, between the cellular infrastructure and the WLAN infrastructure, which is considered a key feature in the latest 3GPP and IETF specifications. This article presents and compares two possible approaches to IP flow mobility offloading that are currently being considered by the IETF. The first one is based on extending existing client-based IP mobility solutions to allow flow mobility where the user terminal is fully involved in the mobility process, and the second one is based on extending current network- based IP mobility solutions where the user terminal is not aware of the mobility.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular communication networks have emerged as a promising platform for the deployment of safety and infotainment applications. The stack of protocols for vehicular networks will potentially include Network Mobility Basic Support (NEMO BS) to enable IP mobility for infotainment and Internet-based applications. However, the protocol has performance limitations in highly dynamic scenarios, and several route optimization mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these limitations. This article addresses the problem of IP mobility and its specific requirements in vehicular scenarios. A qualitative comparison among the existent IP mobility solutions that optimize NEMO BS in vehicular networks is provided. Their improvements with respect to the current standard, their weaknesses, and their fulfillment of the specific requirements are also identified. In addition, the article describes some of the open research challenges related to IP mobility in vehicular scenarios.",

However, IP has to be delivered to the last node in the field in order to become the lingua franca of the future smart grid. This article presents a novel approach in power line communication that delivers high resilient communication capable of efficiently transmitting IPv6. Based on the requirements of smart grid applications, the architecture of the communication system developed in the DLC+VIT4IP project is presented. New techniques for integrating IPv6, IPsec security, robust header compression, and end-to-end QoS are described, demonstrating the capability of PLC to efficiently handle IPv6 in the field level of the smart grid.",

      "abstract": "The future Internet architecture, aiming at the unification of diverse network technologies, must deal with a series of fundamental issues. This article addresses a specific aspect of the identity management issue: the diversity of user identities and identity related user data exchanged among users and services. Existing research efforts propose solutions applicable only within specific service contexts or administrative domains. Any efforts for interoperation and convergence among them require laborious adaptation of their internal mechanisms and protocol formats with the presence of a global ID as a prerequisite. This article proposes a new distributed architecture called Dynamic Identity Mapping, Association N' Discovery System (DIMANDS) that discovers and creates trusted and secure associations among a user's identity related data that reside in various network locations and contexts.",

      "abstract": "Bluetooth has become a ubiquitous technology present in almost every electronic device. A question often asked by manufacturers and final users is whether it can be used for uses other than the ones for which it was designed; in particular, for improved multimedia traffic support, with the fewest modifications in the implementation of the protocol (both hardware and software). In this article we analyze the impact on performance of the lowest levels of the Bluetooth architecture through a relevant parameter known as the polling time, T<sub>poll</sub>. Here, we report on simulations of specific algorithms that allow to dynamically adapt the network to an optimal value of T<sub>poll</sub> during transmission. We place special emphasis on the role of the kind of traffic on the network (e.g., constant bit rate, burst, multimedia-like). In addition, we analyze the results of simulations by comparing these algorithms with the static allocation value defined in the Bluetooth specification. Our results provide insight on how to optimize the transmission of multimedia traffic over piconets at the lowest layers of the Bluetooth architecture.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications play a critical role in enabling numerous important cooperative safety applications. V2V safety communications rely on broadcast of self-state information (e.g., position, speed, and heading) by each vehicle, which allows a vehicle to track its neighboring vehicles in real time. One of the most pressing challenges in this research is to maintain acceptable tracking accuracy of neighboring vehicles while avoiding congestion in the shared communication channel. In this article we describe the evaluation of a transmission control protocol that adapts the message rate and transmission power for V2V safety communications. This protocol has been implemented on V2V test vehicles with wireless radios and integrated with existing active safety applications. The testing and evaluation results show that proposed communication design works well in practice, its performance matches the observations from previous simulations and shows great promise for a large-scale deployment of V2V cooperative safety systems.",

The next generation of applications will continue this trend and be more interactive and distributed, putting the prosumers at the center of a massively multiparticipant communications environment. Furthermore, future networked media environments will be high-quality, multisensory, multi-viewpoint and multistreamed, relying on HD and 3D video. These applications will place unprecedented demands on networks between unpredictable and arbitrarily large meshes of network endpoints. We advocate the development of intelligent cross-layer techniques that, on one hand, will mobilize network and user resources to provide network capacity where it is needed, and, on the other hand, will ensure that the applications adapt themselves and the content they are conveying to available network resources. This article presents an architecture to enable this level of cooperation between the application providers, the users, and the communications networks so that the quality of experience of the users of the application is improved and network traffic optimized.",

      "abstract": "Every day, more services in the Internet (Youtube, Facebook, etc.) are being massively used, while network operators struggle to maintain their performance. Since simulations are not always accurate and evaluation prior to deployment is a must, it is often convenient to build an emulation testbed to test these services in more realistic environments. This methodology proposes four steps to guide researchers in this task. Before running the experiments and gathering results, it is necessary to specify the service under test, define the testbed requirements, and allocate the resources properly. For this reason, a set of techniques are proposed to solve the most common challenges at every step, such as adding real users or selecting the best simulation technique for our goals. The purpose is to efficiently employ the available resources without compromising the realism and accuracy of results. The application of the methodology to a case study, a high-quality audio and video on-demand service over a communication network, shows how resource constraints can be overcome to accomplish our goals.",

Nevertheless, the need for improved network efficiency and the business interests of Internet service providers (ISPs) are both strong drivers toward a cross-layer approach in peer-to-peer protocol design, calling for P2P systems that would in some way interact with the ISPs. Recent research shows that the interaction, which can rely on information provided by both parties, can be mutually beneficial. In this article we first give an overview of the kinds of information that could potentially be exchanged between the P2P systems and the ISPs, and discuss their usefulness and the ease of obtaining and exchanging them. We also present a classification of the possible approaches for interaction based on the level of involvement of the ISPs and the P2P systems, and we discuss the potential strengths and the weaknesses of these approaches.",

Two types of cognitive base-stations are considered: the macro-cell evolved-NodeB (eNB) and the femtocell Home evolved NodeBs (HeNB). In the context of an isolated cell or a multi-cell LTE network, the insufficiency of traditional interference management schemes is shown. Implementation of cognitive tasks such as radio scene analysis and dynamic resource access are then introduced. We argue that such cognitive basestations can exploit their knowledge of the radio scene to intelligently allocate resources and to mitigate prohibitive Co-Channel Interference (CCI). Given the distributed architecture of LTE networks, we will elaborate on cognitive interference mitigation solutions and further propose two different Game Theoretical mechanisms to achieve CCI mitigation in a distributed manner.",

      "abstract": "The current radio environment is characterized by its heterogeneity. Different aspects of this heterogeneity include multiple operators and services, various radio access technologies, different network topologies, a broad range of radio equipment, and multiple frequency bands. Such an environment has a lot of technical and business opportunities. Examples are joint management of several radio access networks within one operator to balance load of these networks, detecting and using unused spectrum in the allocated frequency bands without interrupting the operation of the primary users of such frequency bands, and spectrum trading between several operators. To exploit such opportunities, the concept of cognitive radio system has been developed. Many CRS usage scenarios and business cases are possible. This has triggered a lot of standardization activity at all levels, including in the International Telecommunication Union, IEEE, European Telecommunications Standards Institute, and European Association for Standardizing Information and Communication Systems; each of these organizations is considering multiple CRS deployment scenarios and business directions. This article describes the current concept of the CRS and shows the big picture of international standardization of the CRS. Understanding of these standardization activities is very important for both academia and industry in order to select important research topics and promising business directions.",

Each of these services may have different QoS requirements based on the overall end user's perception. New QoS policies are required that adapt the traditional QoS regulatory model to this emerging context. This article presents a user-centric approach to identify key factors contributing to the development of QoS regulation for future networks. A case study shows the application of our user-centric QoS model to Internet QoS regulation in Spain. The results of the study demonstrate the need to adapt current regulatory frameworks to ensure competition, pluralism, and diversity in the new network environment.",

The IETF GEOPRIV architecture provides a unified geolocation system for the Internet, allowing applications to benefit from current geolocation design patterns as well as some new security and privacy features.",

      "abstract": "This article originates from a panel with the above title, held at IEEE VTC Spring 2009, in which the authors took part. The enthusiastic response it received prompted us to discuss for a wider audience whether research at the physical layer (PHY) is still relevant to the field of wireless communications. Using cellular systems as the axis of our exposition, we exemplify areas where PHY research has indeed hit a performance wall and where any improvements are expected to be marginal. We then discuss whether the research directions taken in the past have always been the right choice and how lessons learned could influence future policy decisions. Several of the raised issues are subsequently discussed in greater details, e.g., the growing divergence between academia and industry. With this argumentation at hand, we identify areas that are either under-developed or likely to be of impact in coming years \u2014 hence corroborating the relevance and importance of PHY research.",

      "abstract": "Due to their broadcast nature, wireless networks are highly susceptible to jamming attacks resulting in denial of service. Game theory provides powerful tools to model and analyze such attacks. This article discusses a class of such jamming games played at the MAC layer among a set of transmitters and jammers. The equilibrium strategies resulting from these jamming games characterize the expected performance under DoS attacks and motivate robust network protocol design for secure wireless communications. A key characteristic of distributed wireless access networks is that users do not have complete information regarding the other user's identities, the traffic dynamics, the channel characteristics, or the costs and rewards of other users. Bayesian games are shown to be useful for modeling such uncertainties under different models for the MAC layer. Different wireless network scenarios with single-stage and repeated game formulations are described to illustrate the performance loss of jamming attacks with increasing network uncertainty.",

This article focuses on the Layer 3 WMN, which provides the same service interfaces and functionalities to the conventional mobile host (MH) as the conventional wireless local area network. Three essential design issues to realize seamless mobility management in the Layer 3 WMN are identified and systematically discussed in this article. They are IP address resolution, location management, and Media Access Control (MAC) address resolution. The Layer 3 WMN backbone requires systematic management of the IP and MAC addresses of each MH, which can be realized by four basic approaches: centralized management, home management, replication management, and distributed management. It is shown that the address pair management architecture is fundamental to realizing efficient packet forwarding and address resolution. Design guidelines are provided to realize Layer 3 WMN supporting seamless MH roaming, considering the applicability of address pair management architectures with regard to WMN scale and client mobility; this applicability is considered based on a qualitative evaluation of the management overhead and handover performance.",

      "abstract": "In this article, a survey of several important equilibrium concepts for decentralized networks is presented. The term decentralized is used here to refer to scenarios where decisions (e.g., choosing a power allocation policy) are taken autonomously by devices interacting with each other (e.g., through mutual interference). The iterative long-term interaction is characterized by stable points of the wireless network called equilibria. The interest in these equilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they can be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To achieve these equilibria, several learning techniques - the best response dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement learning algorithms, and regret matching - are discussed in terms of information requirements and convergence properties. Most of the notions introduced here, for both equilibria and learning schemes, are illustrated by a simple case study, an interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs.",

Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and its ancestors are emphasized, while some Ethernet contributions to DSL are also cited.",

      "abstract": "Designing for competition is an important consideration for the design of future Internet architectures. Network architects should systematically consider the loci of competition in any proposed network architecture. To be economically sustainable, network architectures should encourage competition within each locus, anticipate and manage the interactions between the loci, and be adaptable to evolution in the loci. Given the longevity of network architectures relative to network technologies and applications, it is important to ensure that competition is not unnecessarily foreclosed at any particular locus of competition.",

      "abstract": "Machine-to-machine communications are gaining tremendous interest from mobile network operators, equipment vendors, device manufacturers, as well as research and standardization bodies. Indeed, M2M is a promising technology for the development of Internet of Things communications platforms, with high potential to enable a wide range of applications in different domains. However, providing suitable answers to the issues stemming from IoT platform design requires middleware-level solutions to enable seamless interoperability between M2M-based applications and existing Internetbased services. To the best of our knowledge, available proposals in the field are still immature and tend to be proof of concept prototypes that address specific issues stemming from IoT domains. This article starts from a different perspective and aims at investigating the possibility of implementing M2M solutions on top of currently available, mature, production-level solutions. In this vein, we here present and discuss the design and implementation of an M2M application in the field of road traffic management that integrates, for the sake of efficiency, with a broad IMS-based service infrastructure.",

To serve mission-critical services in public safety and disaster relief communications using the fiber-wireless integration, key challenges such as fault recovery, security, and quality of service assurance must be addressed. This article introduces MC-FiWiBAN, a new emergency-aware architecture that leverages layer 2 virtual private networks to support mission-critical services over the integration. Each virtual private network corresponds to a specific mission-critical system requirements bundle that is stipulated in the service level agreement and fulfilled via an effective resource management paradigm. Simulation results show that MC-FiWiBAN can commit guaranteed quality of service for emergency and non-emergency services.",

      "abstract": "Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have emerged as a cutting edge technology for next-generation communications, and are undergoing rapid development and inspiring numerous applications. This article presents an investigation of the application of M2M communications in the smart grid. First, an overview of M2M communications is given. The enabling technologies and open research issues of M2M communications are also discussed. Then we address the network design issue of M2M communications for a home energy management system (HEMS) in the smart grid. The network architecture for HEMS to collect status and power consumption demand from home appliances is introduced. Then the optimal HEMS traffic concentration is presented and formulated as the optimal cluster formation. A dynamic programming algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal solution. The numerical results show that the proposed optimal traffic concentration can minimize the cost of HEMS.",

However, it still remains challenging to strike a balance between content sharing and rights management. Marlin is developing open standards for interoperable DRM technology. The Octopus and NEMO frameworks in Marlin are the underlying technologies to realize seamless content sharing and rights management to support a wide variety of business models. We demonstrate the use of Octopus and NEMO in a practical manner by means of Marlin Broadband Network Services (MBNS) and Marlin Shared Domain (MSD). Marlin Simple Secure Streaming (MS3) is designed for protecting streaming content in a simple and efficient manner. We show the industrial adoption of Marlin as the first step toward creating an open and interoperable DRM ecosystem through example deployments of Marlin technology in the market.",

      "abstract": "BitTorrent is the most successful peer-to-peer application. In the last years the research community has studied the BitTorrent ecosystem by collecting data from real BitTorrent swarms using different measurement techniques. In this article we present the first survey of these techniques that constitutes a first step in the design of future measurement techniques and tools for analyzing large-scale systems. The techniques are classified into macroscopic, microscopic, and complementary. Macroscopic techniques allow us to collect aggregated information of torrents and present very high scalability, able to monitor up to hundreds of thousands of torrents in short periods of time. Microscopic techniques operate at the peer level and focus on understanding performance aspects such as the peers\u00bf download rates. They offer higher granularity but do not scale as well as macroscopic techniques. Finally, complementary techniques utilize recent extensions to the BitTorrent protocol in order to obtain both aggregated and peer-level information. The article also summarizes the main challenges faced by the research community to accurately measure the BitTorrent ecosystem such as accurately identifying peers and estimating peers' upload rates. Furthermore, we provide possible solutions to address the described challenges.",

In this article, we provide an overview of these standards from the media access control technology perspective, and the similarities and dissimilarities between the IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn standards are discussed, as well as potential performance issues.

It allows mobile users to participate in multimedia conferences involving, besides an XMPP-based chat, both audio and video streams. The article discusses the design and implementation of the conferencing client and highlights the most notable solutions we devised in order to effectively handle a whole suite of protocols, ranging from signaling (SIP/SDP, XMPP) to real-time streaming (RTP). We also provide information about the main performance figures characterizing the client's behavior.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative relaying is an important technology adopted in 4G cellular networks to improve network coverage and capacity. A relay network will require careful planning and deployment in order to fully exploit the potential performance gain in system capacity and cell coverage. Efficient mobile association and load balancing schemes play an important role in achieving high system capacity and satisfactory user experience in a traditional cellular network. This objective becomes more challenging when low-power relay nodes are overlaid with the existing high-power base stations. In this article, the main challenges for mobile association and load balancing in a cooperative relay network are addressed. A jointly optimal mobile association and load balancing framework that aims to maximize the relay network capacity is presented. In addition, a heuristic algorithm that enables a practical implementation is described. Simulation results show that the proposed mobile association and load balancing method outperforms the conventional counterparts.",

We present a brief overview of existing mobile crowdsensing applications, explain their unique characteristics, illustrate various research challenges, and discuss possible solutions.

      "abstract": "The multitude of applications envisioned for vehicular ad hoc networks requires efficient communication and dissemination mechanisms to prevent network congestion. In-network data aggregation promises to reduce bandwidth requirements and enable scalability in large vehicular networks. However, most existing aggregation schemes are tailored to specific applications and types of data. Proper comparative evaluation of different aggregation schemes is difficult. Yet, comparability is essential to properly measure accuracy, performance, and efficiency. We outline a modeling approach for VANET aggregation schemes to achieve objective comparability. Our modeling approach consists of three models, which provide different perspectives on an aggregation scheme. The generalized architecture model facilitates categorization of aggregation schemes. The aggregation information flow model supports analysis of where information is aggregated by a scheme. The aggregation state graph models how knowledge about the road network and its environment is represented by a scheme. Furthermore, it facilitates error estimation with respect to the ground truth. We apply each modeling approach to existing aggregation schemes from the literature and highlight strengths, as well as weaknesses, that can be used as a starting point for designing a more generic aggregation scheme.",

The idea is to use multilength variable-weight optical orthogonal codes as signature sequences of a hybrid WDM/OCDM system. To provide the requested classes of service, the code weight and code length of MLVW-OOCs are designed based on the characteristics of the requested classes of service. In order to mitigate multiple access interference, we propose to utilize a multilevel signaling technique and interference remover structure based on advanced optical logic gate elements. We show that utilizing such a technique improves the QoS of the proposed scheme.",

By contrast, in this treatise, we endeavor to further develop a link between the traditional fixed-rate codes and the recently developed rateless codes by delving into their underlying attributes. This joint treatment is beneficial for two principal reasons. First, it facilitates the task of researchers and practitioners, who might be familiar with fixed-rate codes and would like to jump-start their understanding of the recently developed concepts in the rateless reality. Second, it provides grounds for extending the use of the well-understood code-design tools - originally contrived for fixed-rate codes - to the realm of rateless codes. Indeed, these versatile tools proved to be vital in the design of diverse fixed-rate-coded communications systems, and thus our hope is that they will further elucidate the associated performance ramifications of the rateless coded schemes.",

In this work, we introduce the basic principles of NC and discuss their applicability to NG-PONs, with a focus on layer 2 design. Our example illustrations and simulations demonstrate significant potential performance improvements in various NG-PON scenarios while clarifying some underlying topological constraints of NC.",

Although many of these challenges are political, there are significant technical challenges that are currently being addressed by the research community. This article presents some of the challenges faced by the NM architecture from the tactical edge and across the global information grid, where IPbased networks and radios must work together seamlessly in joint missions in the presence of encryption tunnels. It shows some cases where unconventional NM techniques must be considered in order to meet the objectives of joint missions. These techniques should be considered when different networks from the same force (e.g., the U.S. Army), joint U.S. military services' networks, and coalition forces' networks interface together. The article is divided into three main sections. The first presents some of the urgent challenges facing NM interoperability across the GIG, while the second covers an architectural approach that relies on gateway nodes and abstraction techniques. The third section presents a conflict resolution case showing how different tactical network managers need to interface to each other with techniques that are not considered in commercial networks.",

      "abstract": "The cost of failures within communication networks is significant and will only increase as their reach further extends into the way our society functions. Some aspects of network resilience, such as the application of fault-tolerant systems techniques to optical switching, have been studied and applied to great effect. However, networks - and the Internet in particular - are still vulnerable to malicious attacks, human mistakes such as misconfigurations, and a range of environmental challenges. We argue that this is, in part, due to a lack of a holistic view of the resilience problem, leading to inappropriate and difficult-to-manage solutions. In this article, we present a systematic approach to building resilient networked systems. We first study fundamental elements at the framework level such as metrics, policies, and information sensing mechanisms. Their understanding drives the design of a distributed multilevel architecture that lets the network defend itself against, detect, and dynamically respond to challenges. We then use a concrete case study to show how the framework and mechanisms we have developed can be applied to enhance resilience.",

      "abstract": "Mobile network operators, with decreasing revenue but high network performance requirements, are standing at a crossroads. Investing in 3GPP defined highly functional mobile networks and the consequent maintenance to sustain the market-driven network service quality standard results in high total cost of ownership unseen in fixed operators. Revenue reduction will make it significantly difficult to fund such TCO in the future. In this light, sharing networks is a viable solution to reduce network expenditure, as can also be seen from present trends. However, current networking sharing solutions, although reducing TCO, come with limitations in network management flexibility, and standalone decision making in network expansion and service introduction. Virtualization-based isolation techniques have the potential of enabling network sharing along with management flexibility and independence among the sharing entities. However, virtualization brings added complexity to the overall network management structure. In this article, we propose a next mobile network architecture, where the physical network infrastructure is shared by multiple entities, but the management and control of the physical infrastructure, virtual network creation and maintenance, and the usage of the virtual networks are decoupled from each other to reduce management complexity in each segment. In addition, we address the technical as well as business perspectives of the proposed architecture, discuss open issues, and provide research directions to realize such a flexible value-added commercial network for the future.",

Operational effectiveness for surveillance missions can be enhanced further through network centric capability, where distributed UGS networks have the ability to perform surveillance operations autonomously. NCC operation can be enhanced through UGSs having the ability to evaluate their awareness of the current joint surveillance environment, in order to provide the necessary adaptation to dynamic changes. NCC can also provide an advantage for UGS networks to self-manage their limited operational resources efficiently, according to mission objective priority. In this article, we present a crosslayer approach and highlight techniques that have potential to enable NCC operation within a mission-orientated UGS surveillance setting.",

This demand has increased the need for an evaluation framework to analyze the quality of such multimedia services and network performances for the related research areas. This article proposes OEFMON, an open framework for evaluating the quality of multimedia transmissions over networks. OEFMON integrates a multimedia module and a network simulator. The major advantages of OEFMON compared to other existing work are support for any number of multimedia codecs, adaptive coding based on network feedback, on-the-fly observation of multimedia transmission, and easy extension for other tools. A couple of case studies are performed to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our framework.",

      "abstract": "In next generation networks, voice, data, and multimedia services will be converged onto a single network platform with increasing complexity and heterogeneity of underlying wireless and optical networking systems. These services should be delivered in the most cost- and resource-efficient manner with ensured user satisfaction. To this end, service providers are now switching the focus from network Quality of Service (QoS) to user Quality of Experience (QoE), which describes the overall performance of a network from the user perspective. High network QoS can, in many cases, result in high QoE, but it cannot assure high QoE. Optimizing end-to-end QoE must consider other contributing factors of QoE such as the application-level QoS, the capability of terminal equipment and customer premises networks, and subjective user factors. This article discusses challenges and a possible solution for optimizing end-to-end QoE in Next Generation Networks.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been intense focus on increasing the energy efficiency of IT infrastructure. We advocate the need to consider energy consumption holistically over the entire lifetime of these devices. Life cycle energy considerations include a number of factors, of which operational energy consumption is just one. Of all the IT components, networks have received relatively little attention when it comes to energy efficient operation, and even that has been too focused on operational power consumption. In this article, we describe the challenges relating to life cycle energy management of network devices, present a sustainability analysis of these devices, and develop techniques to significantly reduce network operational power. A distinguishing feature of our work is that it is applicable to legacy devices, and as such can be deployed now, as opposed to waiting for new standards and products to be developed.",

We argue that the architecture of routers in constructing the Internet can be improved so as to fully utilize chances to save energy related to transmission equipment.

      "abstract": "The femtocell concept is an integral part of the telecommunication industry's efforts to provide high-throughput, high quality services into the users' home. In contrast to conventional cell types which are well-planned by the operators, femtocell base stations are supposed to be installed by customers themselves, similar to a WiFi access point. Unlike WiFi, however, femtocells operate mainly in licensed bands, such that operators are in control of the radio interface. This brings new challenges as well as opportunities for femtocell design; these include sophisticated mobility and interference management, increased reliability, as well as deployment in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive progress in femtocell design has been made in Advanced WiMAX recently, which is associated with the IEEE 802.16m update in 2011. This article gives an overview and update on novel concepts and mechanisms for femtocell support in the network architecture and air interface that have been adopted into the WiMAX Forum network specifications and the IEEE 802.16m specification.",

Not only electric energy but also data flows are required between all the actors involved. A communication network between components and actuators is needed for functionalities such as grid operation, monitoring, and protection. This article studies powerline communication for a low-voltage direct current distribution system. An LVDC system is considered as part of future smart grids. The channel characteristic measurements carried out for an LVDC laboratory setup and the subsequent theoretical and practical analysis show that the studied LVDC distribution system provides a suitable medium for the high frequency band PLC between 5 and 20 MHz when an inductive PLC signal coupling method is used. Moreover, the article proposes an IP-based PLC network concept for the LVDC system; the concept is based on commercial industrial compliant HF band PLC modems.",

In-service monitoring of the PON's fiber infrastructure is a powerful enabling tool to those ends, and a number of techniques have been proposed, some of them based on optical time-domain reflectometry. In this work we address the required features of PON monitoring techniques and review the major candidate technologies. We highlight some of the limitations of standard and adapted OTDR techniques as well as non-OTDR schemes. Among the proposed optical-layer monitoring schemes, we describe our novel optical-coding-based reflection monitoring proposal and report on recent progress. We end with a discussion of promising solution paths.",

      "abstract": "Scalable video delivery over peer-to-peer networks appears to be key for efficient streaming in emerging and future Internet applications. Contrasting the conventional server-client approach, here, video is delivered to a user in a fully distributed fashion. This is, for instance, beneficial in cases where a high demand for a particular video content is imposed, as different users can receive the same data from different peers. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneous nature of Internet connectivity, the content needs to be delivered to a user through networks with highly varying bandwidths. Moreover, content needs to be displayed on a variety of devices featuring different sizes, resolutions, and computational capabilities. If video is encoded in a scalable way, it can be adapted to any required spatio-temporal resolution and quality in the compressed domain, according to a peer bandwidth and other peers\u00bf context requirements. This enables efficient low-complexity content adaptation and interoperability for improved peer-to-peer streaming in future Internet applications. An efficient piece picking and peer selection policy enables high quality of service in such a streaming system.",

However, all real-time services require that synchronization and timing information be delivered over the network. Performance of timing distribution is quantified using particular metrics and adherence to requirements determined by using masks. The traditional metrics, TDEV and MTIE, have extensions to packet-switched networks for addressing the corruption of timing information by packet delay variation. The principles of metrics and masks and these extensions are presented here.",

Recent announcements of first practical 10G-EPON demonstrations [1, 2] indicate rapid adoption of these specifications by system vendors. Given the growing interest in 10G-EPON, it is useful to examine the worst-case scenario performance of this new first-mile access network in both downstream and upstream channels. Due to the number of technical changes introduced to 10G-EPON when compared with 1G-EPON, the obtained performance figures are substantially different from those of its predecessor. The results presented in this article have been obtained through an analytical model and confirmed by detailed simulation.",

      "abstract": "The power consumption of a network becomes a critical performance metric for a petabit-per-second scale Internet, in addition to the system cost. We investigate the power and cost efficiency of all-optical and electrical technologies to understand the design principle for petabit-scale hybrid optical switch nodes for optical packet and burst switching. In order to achieve an efficient hybrid design, we point out the interesting observation that the use of long packets switched by passive-medium photonic switches can substantially reduce power consumption and system cost. For contention resolution, shared electronic memory buffers are more effective and power efficient than fiber delay line buffers. An empirical optimization exhibits that a traditional all-optical solution is not the best choice for power and cost efficiency. Using passive-medium photonic switches with electronic memory buffers, we can introduce a substantial savings in power and cost, approximately half of those of commercially available optical cross-connect systems, with a packet loss rate as low as 10<sup>-</sup>6.",

In this article we characterize the power consumption in the different types of networks and discuss strategies to reduce the power consumption.",

      "abstract": "Providing power from the central office to telephone apparatus is used in copper-based systems to achieve high availability, low cost, and low electricity power consumption. It is feasible to power the telephone at customer premises optically by sending optical power over the optical fiber connection. Very-low-power-consumption optical communications systems such as interferometer-based systems must be used. The power consumption of a standard telephone apparatus in its different states is analyzed, and a simple mathematical model is developed and used to calculate the power required to operate the telephone for different durations of different states. Optical power levels transmitted over optical fiber are limited by nonlinear effects and safety standards. The mathematical model is used to compare the power consumption, electricity cost, and carbon footprint of a telephone system over copper twisted pair, GPON, and interferometric systems. Current standard GPON and EPON equipment cannot be powered over optical fiber, and must use battery backup. An interferometric system can consume less power than a copper-based system, depending on the optical source's electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency, the photovoltaic cells' optical to electrical conversion efficiency, and Call and Ringing durations. Low-cost telephone service with 24/7 availability over optical fiber provides the infrastructure to offer broadband and HDTV exploiting the more than 30,000 GHz capacity of the optical fiber.",

The precongestion notification (PCN) mechanism is a measurement-based approach, recently standardized by the IETF, optimized toward the admission of inelastic flows, where the number of flows is sufficiently large that individual bursts of flows can be compensated by silence periods of others. In this article, we discuss the implications of applying PCN to protect video services, which have less predictable behavior. Several algorithms for protecting video services in multimedia access networks are described. Through performance evaluation, we show the impact of these algorithms on the network utilization and video quality, and present guidelines on how to configure a PCN system.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of wireless technologies has resulted in mobile phones and wireless devices becoming essential and ubiquitous elements in everyday domestic and business activity. Wireless devices are also used by emergency and support services. While wireless communication is more flexible than wired communication, it is often not robust, and the coverage is not always complete. In this article, we describe a mobile middleware architecture using delay-tolerant network (DTN) technology, and publish/subscribe concepts. The purpose of the middleware is to add resilience and reach to wireless communications, and reduce battery drainage of the mobile devices and hence extend operational lifetime. The same technology has the potential to provide a fallback communication platform providing greater penetration than that which would otherwise be available in situations where the conventional cellular structure is no longer working or access is limited. It can enable mobile users to connect through the help of multiple radio interface technologies and to exploit physical movement using the inherent relaying capability of DTNs. The approach exploits the synergy between publish/subscribe message-oriented middleware (MOM) and DTN, as neither requires an end-to-end connection at one moment in time. Scenarios based on exploiting any available connection, communication even when there is extreme wireless coverage failure, and a prototype developed on the Android mobile platform are presented. Some relevant issues are also analyzed related to the practical deployment, viz. message routing, energy efficiency, and security.",

      "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption in the Internet has become an increasingly important goal recently. Previous work on reducing energy consumption has primarily looked at either changing link rates or putting interfaces to sleep. Due to the unpredictable nature of traffic, the energy savings achieved have been modest, do not scale, and incur losses and delay. This article proposes a different approach to the problem, which involves aggregating traffic from multiple input links prior to feeding them to the switch interfaces. The main results we obtain are that energy consumption, measured as fraction of interfaces that are awake, scales linearly with load for all loads and the algorithms are fully deterministic yielding zero packet loss.",

Apart from presenting a detailed description of QoS itself, it overviews classes of service (CoS) proposed by main standardization bodies and maps them across various transmission technologies. Standards and concepts related to less commonly used, though not less important, terms such as Grade of Service (GoS), Quality of Resilience (QoR), and Quality of Experience (QoE) are also discussed. While provisioning of QoS, CoS, GoS, and QoR is related to various aspects of networking and network performance, QoE describes resulting service features as perceived by the customer. Relations between those intrinsic network features and resulting human-experienced quality are discussed. The above set of QoX terms (where X stands for Service, Experience, etc.) is sufficient to describe and distinguish all aspects of service provisioning.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation networks, as envisioned by ITU-T, are packet-based networks, capable of provisioning consistent and ubiquitous services to end users independent of the network, access technology, and devices used. RESTful web services are now being contemplated as a technology for service provisioning in NGNs. They are emerging as an alternative, which may be more adequate than SOAP-based web services in some cases. SOAP-based web services are modular applications that can be discovered and invoked over a network. RESTful web services, on the other hand, are defined as a network architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. This article presents a survey on RESTful web services for service provisioning in NGNs. It introduces the concept of RESTful web services and reviews the state of the art of RESTful-based service provisioning in NGNs. It also provides an evaluation of the overall suitability of RESTful web services for service provisioning in NGNs, and discusses research directions. RESTful web services do show significant potential for service provisioning in NGNs. However, open issues such as publication/discovery and mechanisms for the development of complex session-based services need to be solved before its full potential can be realized.",

If a catastrophic disaster destroyed a city's central network office, telecommunications users in that region would lose their network connectivity - data, voice, cellular - until the office's capabilities could be restored. That isolation could put lives and livelihoods at risk as an affected city tried to respond to a large natural or man-made disaster. AT&amp;T has a mature network emergency management and business continuity program that plans for and responds to events that affect the AT&amp;T network and its support systems around the globe. Within that NEM plan, the AT&amp;T Network Disaster Recovery team is responsible for the restoration of a failed network office's services. This article will describe NDR's mobile response process and how it fits within AT&amp;T's overall response to a disaster.",

      "abstract": "Prioritization of flows in a home network based on traffic classification is still no guarantee that enough bandwidth will be available between a content server and a client. Besides, such QoS technologies need to be supported by every device in the end-to-end path to be effective, which is relatively expensive for the owners of home networks. In any small-scale IP network, best effort or QoS-enabled, at home or anywhere else, it is therefore preferable to diagnose the network in real time before admitting a new flow. In this article we analyze existing probing techniques, and demonstrate a new method to probe the available bandwidth between a server and a client in a heterogeneous IP-based home network. The tool works with existing end-user devices, is non-intrusive, has a short measurement time, does not require preknowledge of the link layer network topology, and is accurate enough to make decisions about the admission of high-throughput high-quality streams such as for IPTV services.",

      "abstract": "Cellular wireless networks are expected to provide high-quality audio and video services while enabling fast and low-cost Internet access to mobile users. The need for green cost-efficient networks is twofold: reduce the service price and preserve the environment. In this work, we discuss the various strategies that help reduce infrastructure costs, power costs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with no impairments on the quality of network services. These strategies range over a wide area from enhancing the electronics, to developing new energy-aware radio access protocols, to deploying enhanced base stations with tunable capacity. To reduce both capital and operational expenditures, and the GHG footprint, manufacturers propose new compact installation with lightweight antenna systems, very efficient power amplifiers, and efficient hardware and software. The resulting economy can be up to 50 percent or more by reducing the electricity bill, sparing the use of air conditioning, and deploying compact sites that would seldom require maintenance. Recent scientific publications confirm that a very high gain could be achieved by optimizing the use of base stations proactively, and huge additional improvements could be obtained by optimizing power saving mechanisms by leveraging traffic statistics.",

      "abstract": "Intervehicle communication has become an extremely hot topic in networking research, opening up new research challenges well beyond those of classical mobile ad hoc network research. In October 2010, a Dagstuhl seminar has been organized bringing together many of the internationally leading experts in this field to discuss open issues and challenges related to IVC. This article reports the main findings of this meeting, that was set up to cover a wide range of topics. In particular, the following four areas were studied in working groups: Fundamental Limits and Opportunities of IVC, IVC Communication Principles and Patterns, Security and Privacy in IVC, and IVC Simulation and Modeling. A general conclusion drawn is that IVC is now at a turning point where the firstgeneration systems are engineered and will soon be brought to the market, while at the same time, IVC is experiencing the beginning of a new era characterized by a more fundamental research approach.",

IEEE standards including IEEE 802.11p and IEEE P1609.1-4 have emerged to provide a framework for intervehicular communication (IVC). However, due to particular characteristics of IVC, such as high mobility, unstable connectivity, and network partitioning, information routing becomes inevitably challenging. This article reviews the recent research progress to highlight research challenges in vehicular routing protocol as a guideline for future development of IVC applications. The article focuses on the IEEE DSRC/WAVE standard. The state of the art in IVC routing protocols is surveyed, and open issues for further research are highlighted in the article.",

Small cells have a big role to play in orchestrating a cellular network that can overcome the explosive mobile traffic upsurge at little cost to the network operator. However, if left unchecked, a large-scale small cell deployment can substantially increase the network energy consumption with strong ecological and economic implications. In this article, we introduce energy-efficient SLEEP mode algorithms for small cell base stations in a bid to reduce cellular networks' power consumption. The designed algorithms allow the hardware components in the BS to be astutely switched off in idle conditions, such that the energy consumption is modulated over the variations in traffic load. Three different strategies for algorithm control are discussed, relying on small cell driven, core network driven, and user equipment driven approaches. Based on a mixed voice and data traffic model, the algorithms present energy saving opportunities of approximately 10-60 percent in the network with respect to no SLEEP mode activation in small cells, coupled with additional capacity incentives.",

To unleash their full potential, access to sensors should be opened such that their data and services can be integrated with data and services available in other information systems, facilitating novel applications and services that are based on the state of the real world. We describe our vision and architecture of a Semantic Web of Things: a service infrastructure that makes the deployment and use of semantic applications involving Internet-connected sensors almost as easy as building, searching, and reading a web page today.",

The original model in legacy fixed telephony networks was in most cases quite simple: the price of the communication depended on the destination, time, and duration of the call. With the emergence of mobile and multimedia networks, the charging model became more complicated. More and more frequently, a subscriber is able to choose between a variety of options on top of the standard tariff. Each option is then applicable to a certain kind of traffic only. The goal of this article is to study how these new charging models impact the technology of online charging systems.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of multilayer networking capabilities opens the path for the deployment of advanced network architectures and resilience concepts. In this article we propose a novel resource-efficient homing scheme we call dual homing with shared backup router resources (SBRR). As the scheme realizes shared routerlevel redundancy with the help of dynamic circuit-switched services, it can achieve significantly lower network costs than today's dual homing architectures. We focus on the discussion of operational aspects related to control plane functions and the evaluation of cost savings. In addition, we address further issues such as the impact of the new homing architecture on the end-to-end connection availability and energy efficiency.",

The components and circuits that are propelling deep submicron silicon technologies in mm-wave system front-ends are surveyed in this article. Onchip passives and interconnect are highlighted, as these are not scaling as aggressively as the transistors with each new IC generation. Other design aspects of wireless front-end circuit blocks relevant to wideband communication and radar ranging are also outlined, specifically the voltage-controlled oscillator and tuned amplifiers for gain and power output. A description of a 2 \u00d7 2 phased-array transmitter demonstrator operating at 60 GHz and fabricated in 65 nm bulk CMOS concludes the discussion.",

One solution to reduce the extra hardware cost and RF circuit imperfection is the utilization of a single RF front-end in a MIMO system. This article discusses the different alternatives to realize single RF front-end transceivers, including the antenna selection technique, time-division multiplexing, code-division multiplexing, and the parasitic antenna method. The implementation technique for each approach is presented, and a performance study has been conducted. The practical limitations of a single RF front-end design alternative are also discussed.",

Next, a 16-element phased-array transceiver chipset for non-line-of-sight communications is described, with emphasis on a new power-efficient phased-array transmitter. Examples of gigabit-per-second line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight link experiments are provided, and system-level implementation trade-offs are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Public acceptance, and thus the economic success, of an ITS is highly dependent on the quality of deployed privacy mechanisms. In general, neither users nor operators should be able to track a given individual. One approach to facilitate this is the usage of pseudonym pools, which allow vehicles to autonomously switch between different identities. We extend this scheme with that of a time-slotted pseudonym pool of static size, reducing the storage and computation needs of the envisioned ITS while further improving users' privacy. In addition, we allow the exchange of pseudonyms between vehicles, eliminating the mapping between vehicles and pseudonyms even for the ITS operator. We support the exchange of both current and future pseudonyms, further enhancing users' privacy. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach and back up privacy claims by performing a simulative study of the system using the entropy of nodes' anonymity sets as the primary metric.",

      "abstract": "This article presents an overview of the background, technology, regulation, and standardization in the course of deploying smart utility networks (SUNs) in TV white space (TVWS) communications, two wireless technologies currently receiving overwhelming interest in the wireless industry and academia. They are independent to and uncorrelated with each other, but share the same mission: conserving resources and increasing efficiency. This article reviews the systems as separate technologies, and then combines them to propose a hybrid solution that draws out their respective advantages. The first part focuses on SUNs and describes the SUN usage model with typical application requirements and practical examples, followed by the latest developments in standardization initiatives with emphasis on the currently active IEEE 802.15.4g and 802.11ah groups. The second part discusses TVWS, studying and summarizing the regulations governing its usage, and then reports on the standardization bodies' responses to these regulations with a focus on IEEE 802.11af, 802.19.1, and 802.22. Finally, the third part amalgamates the SUN usage model with TVWS regulations and deployment scenarios, providing relationship mapping between the SUN components and regulation-compliant TVWS devices. Further discussions concentrate on the opportunities and challenges along the path of realizing a practical SUN in the TVWS spectrum under the current technical and regulatory conditions. Several recommendations are made from both regulatory and technical standpoints to further increase utilization of SUNs in TVWS.",

      "abstract": "Multiple-antenna techniques constitute a key technology for modern wireless communications, which trade-off superior error performance and higher data rates for increased system complexity and cost. Among the many transmission principles that exploit multiple-antenna at either the transmitter, the receiver, or both, Spatial Modulation (SM) is a novel and recently proposed multiple-antenna transmission technique that can offer, with a very low system complexity, improved data rates compared to Single-Input- Single-Output (SISO) systems, and robust error performance even in correlated channel environments. SM is an entirely new modulation concept that exploits the uniqueness and randomness properties of the wireless channel for communication. This is achieved by adopting a simple but effective coding mechanism that establishes a one-to-one mapping between blocks of information bits to be transmitted and the spatial positions of the transmit-antenna in the antenna-array. In this article, we summarize the latest research achievements and outline some relevant open research issues of this recently proposed transmission technique.",

      "abstract": "Multicarrier modulation has been employed in numerous modern wireless communications standards due to its ability in providing high data rates while simultaneously counteracting the effects of intersymbol interference due to multipath fading channels. In the recent years, multicarrier modulation is being investigated as a possible candidate data transmission scheme for achieving spectrally agile wireless access in scenarios where unlicensed users temporarily \"borrow\" unoccupied licensed frequency bands while minimizing interference with spectrally adjacent signals, i.e., opportunistic wireless access. Specifically, the divide-and-conquer data transmission approach employed by multicarrier modulation makes it an attractive option for realizing wireless communication systems that do not require a single continuous transmission frequency band. In this article, we present several multicarrier transmission solutions designed for efficiently achieving opportunistic wireless access. In particular, we shall investigate two types of spectrally-agile multicarrier modulation schemes, namely, non-contiguous orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing and non-contiguous nonorthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. The viability of these two techniques employed within an opportunistic wireless access scenario is assessed using actual spectrum measurement data, and a comparative study in terms of out-of-band interference mitigation as well as implementation complexity is provided.",

SpiderRadio is built using commodity IEEE 802.11a/b/g hardware and the open source MadWiFi driver. This helps us in developing and testing our prototype without having to buy and manage several licensed spectrum bands. We begin with a discussion of the key research issues and challenges in the practical implementation of a dynamic spectrum access network. Then the lessons learned from the development of dynamic spectrum access protocols, designing management frame structures, software implementation of the dynamic spectrum access network protocol stack, and testbed experimental measurement results are presented. Several trade-offs in prototype implementation complexity vs. network performance are also discussed. We also identify potential security vulnerabilities in cognitive radio networks, specifically as applied to SpiderRadio, and point out some defense mechanisms against these vulnerabilities.",

A modular programmable router architecture, which takes advantage of emerging standards, is proposed to support dynamic management and configuration capabilities of network resources and services. The new node design concepts allow vendor-independent development of hybrid router functionalities and possible investigation of new standard interfaces. Validation of the proposed approach is proven in an open source software router context, emulating a hybrid circuit/packet service based on optical switching technology. The software emulator obtained allows programmable hybrid router functionalities to be tested at different levels of abstraction and with different modeling granularities, and is able to represent both logical and physical aspects.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, digital modulation schemes are bijective (i.e., the signal constellation points are disjunct), and the mapping is unique. Only recently it has been discovered that non-bijective modulation schemes may outperform bijective modulation schemes when employed in conjunction with suitable channel coding and iterative processing. In this in-depth tutorial, we clarify myths and facts about non-bijective modulation. Emphasis is on superposition modulation (SM). Without active signal shaping, SM outperforms bit-interleaved coded modulation with PSK or square QAM modulation at even lower receiver complexity.",

All indicators suggest that this trend will continue, and vehicles will soon become first class citizens on the Internet. Vehicle networking opens the door to a vast new class of applications ranging from car monitoring and diagnosis to passenger assistance, communication, and entertainment. In this article we present a comprehensive survey of the existing mobility support solutions, and discuss various design trade-offs and remaining issues in view of vehicle networking. We hope that these discussions can provide useful inputs to car manufacturers in their design considerations for bringing all cars online.",

Current bridged networks do not have mechanisms that enable meeting these requirements under general traffic conditions. IEEE 802.1AS is the AVB standard that will specify requirements to allow for transport of precise timing and synchronization in AVB networks. It is based on IEEE 1588-2008, includes a PTP profile that is applicable to full-duplex IEEE 802.3 transport, and adds specifications for timing transport over IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.3 EPON, and CSN media. This article provides a tutorial on IEEE 802.1AS that updates earlier descriptions, and new simulation results for timing performance.",

The idea is to stream multimedia content from a single source to multiple receivers with direct or multihop connections to the source. First we look into existing solutions for video streaming on the iPhone that use point-to-point architectures. After acknowledging their limitations, we propose a solution based on network coding to efficiently and reliably deliver the multimedia content to many devices in a synchronized manner. Then we introduce an application that implements this technique on the iPhone. We also present our testbed, which consists of 16 iPod Touch devices to showcase the capabilities of our application.",

      "abstract": "System-level simulation has been widely used to evaluate the comprehensive performance of different mobile cellular systems. System-level simulation methodologies for different systems have been discussed by different organizations and institutions. However, the framework for a unified simulation methodology and platform has not been established. In this article, we propose a general unified simulation methodology for different cellular systems. Both the design of the simulation structure and the establishment of the simulation platform are studied. Meanwhile, the unified modeling and the realization of various modules related to the system-level simulation are presented. The proposed unified simulation methodology and the general simulation platform can be used to evaluate the performance of multiple mobile communication systems fairly. Finally, the overall performance of LTE and Mobile WiMAX systems is evaluated through the proposed framework. The key simulation results for both Full Buffer and VoIP traffics are presented and discussed. It is shown that the LTE system exhibits better performance than Mobile WiMAX.",

      "abstract": "Social television, in essence, is a way to share and experience media with others. Rather than attempt to bridge physical distance by creating new social experiences, we have built a system called TakeoverTV that augments canonical social interactions by addressing three key questions: How can we better support social gatherings around media in public and private places?; How can we enable conversation across our devices rather than forcing us to communicate through them?; and How can we help people come to agreements about what media they want to watch together? Primarily aimed at public spaces like bars, TakeoverTV is a system that lets local users influence and interact with the movies and television programs shown on public displays. Our system collects the media preferences of all people physically present at a given location, lets users start a vote among all members of the space, and allows everyone to participate using tangible physical objects like tables in addition to smart devices. Over time, public establishments can evolve complex identities based on the preferences and votes of their patrons while generating valuable analytic data for patrons, establishment owners, content-providers, and advertisers alike.",

      "abstract": "The task of improving the effectiveness of public safety communications has become a main priority for governments. This is partly motivated by the increased risk of natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, and fires, and partly due to the risks and consequent impact of terrorist attacks. This article focuses on the experience from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme project known as EULER, which seeks to demonstrate the benefits of software defined radio technology to support the resolution of natural disasters of significant stature, which require the participation of different public safety and military organizations, potentially of different nations. In such scenarios, the presence of interoperability barriers in the disaster area is a major challenge because different organizations may use different wireless communication systems. In this context, the main aspect investigated in EULER is the definition of a common waveform that respects the software communications architecture constraints, and guarantees maximum portability across SDR platforms. This article discusses a range of issues that have been identified thus far within the EULER project; in particular, the perceived pan-European interoperability needs of public safety, and coordination with military devices and networks. Aspects of interoperability are also extended to the three dimensions of platform, waveform, and information assurance.",

      "abstract": "Large operators have embraced multiprotocol label switching, deploying it in their backbone networks to enable a number of services and applications such as virtual private networks to just name one. Since the inception of the respective IETF working group, MPLS has accumulated a number of features and has been extended to be applicable in new contexts such as optical networks in the form of generalized MPLS. Currently, MPLS is being further extended to finally mature into a technology from which to build a full-fledged packet transport network that fulfills a large number of traditional transport network requirements. Having celebrated the early teens of MPLS in 2009, the IETF might well find itself celebrating MPLS's coming of age with the completion of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). This article is a short tutorial on what MPLS-TP is, how it came about, and what it promises to deliver in the future.",

      "abstract": "Wireless actuators are small scale devices that can act on their environment. The IP multimedia subsystem is an architecture with the goal of seamlessly delivering multimedia services. Combining actuation capabilities with the IMS will certainly enable novel value-added services in areas such as environment monitoring, emergency management and home automation. We have previously proposed an architecture for such integration. This architecture relies on two key components: an actuation control function (ACF) that serves as a higher-level actuation control entity, and a wireless actuators/IMS gateway (WAG) dealing with the interworking between actuator networks and the IMS. In this article, we focus on the design and implementation of the ACF and the WAG. Furthermore, a prototype application is implemented to show how new applications can be built using our integrated architecture. Performance has also been evaluated, and several lessons were learned in the course of this work. One lesson is that integrating the IMS with various and evolving actuators is a continuous task. Without standard APIs for the interaction with actuators produced by different vendors, the WAG needs to be constantly upgraded. Another lesson is that while the introduction of actuation as an application building block in the IMS enables fast and easy development of applications with actuation requirements, the lack of mature IMS application development toolkits remains a barrier.",

      "abstract": "This article quantifies the global carbon footprint of mobile communication systems, and discusses its ecological and economic implications. Using up-to-date data and life cycle assessment models, we predict an increase of CO2 equivalent emissions by a factor of three until 2020 compared to 2007, rising from about 86 to 235 Mto CO<sub>2</sub>e, suggesting a steeper increase than predicted in the well-known SMART2020 report. We provide a breakdown of the global carbon footprint, which reveals that production of mobile devices and global radio access network operation will remain the major contributors, accompanied by an increasing share of emissions due to data transfer in the backbone resulting from rising mobile traffic volumes. The energy bill due to network operation will gain increasing importance in cellular business models. Furthermore, technologies to reduce energy consumption are considered a key enabler for the spread of mobile communications in developing countries. Taking into account several scenarios of technological advancement and rollout, we analyze the overall energy consumption of global radio access networks and illustrate the saving potential of green communication technologies. We conclude that, conditioned on quick implementation and alongside other \"classical\" improvements of spectral efficiency, these technologies offer the potential to serve three orders of magnitude more traffic with the same overall energy consumption as today.",

First, we analyze how the models free space propagation, Rayleigh fading, and Ricean fading in synthetic scenarios with and without background communication influence the simulation of communication in general. After that, we investigate the impact of the models on the simulated behavior of a V2X traffic efficiency application in a real inner city scenario. Our results show that the selection of the propagation model affects the number of delivered messages, but exerts no significant influence on the simulated effectiveness of a V2X traffic efficiency application in urban areas. Under those circumstances, a simplified propagation model is sufficient.",

      "abstract": "Recently, network operators around the world reported statistics of network energy requirements and the related carbon footprint, showing an alarming and growing trend. Such high energy consumption can be mainly ascribed to networking equipment designed to work at maximum capacity with high and almost constant dissipation, independent of the traffic load. However, recent developments of green network technologies suggest the chance to build future devices capable of adapting their performance and energy absorption to meet actual workload and operational requirements. In such a scenario, this contribution aims at evaluating the potential impact on next-generation wireline networks of green technologies in economic and environmental terms. We based our impact analysis on the real network energy-efficiency targets of an ongoing European project, and applied them to the expected deployment of Telecom Italia infrastructure by 2015-2020.",

      "abstract": "Spectrum trading markets are of growing interest to many spectrum management agencies. They are motivated by their desire to increase the use of market-based mechanisms for spectrum management and reduce their emphasis on command and control methods. Despite the liberalization of regulations on spectrum trading in some countries, spectrum markets have not yet emerged as a key spectrum assignment component. The lack of liquidity in these markets is sometimes cited as a primary factor in this outcome. This work focuses on determining the conditions for viability of spectrum trading markets. We make use of agent-based computational economics to analyze different market scenario and the behaviors of its participants. Our results provide guidelines regarding the number of market participants and the amount of tradable spectrum that should be present in a spectrum trading market for it to be viable. We use the results of this analysis to make recommendations for the design of these markets.",

      "abstract": "In this article, I develop two major propositions. First, the future Internet should be polymorphic, and it should conciliate different architectural networking paradigms. The second proposition is that the future Internet should necessarily build on a strong theoretical basis from a networking science that is in the course of development. Particularly, I describe how virtualization makes possible a polymorphic future Internet and provides for easy deployment of new cooperation schemes. Then I attempt to expound on the aspects of security and scalability of the future Internet. This analysis also hopes to account for some justification as to the need for a clean-slate approach to fundamentally tackle the shortcomings of the current Internet and why a polymorphic future Internet is needed to for the coexistence of evolutionary and revolutionary schemes. Admittedly, the future Internet has to be built on strong foundations of networking science. A global theory of cooperation over networks is therefore most needed to foresee the important issues in the design and deployment of the future Internet. Methodologies for experimenting and validating large-scale mechanisms by reproducible large-scale experiments are, moreover, among the expected outcomes of the emerging networking science, which I also discuss in this article.",

      "abstract": "Cloud computing is rapidly emerging as a new model for service delivery, including for telecommunications services (cloud telephony). Although many solutions are now available, cloud management and monitoring technology has not kept pace, partially because of the lack of open source solutions. To address this limitation, this article describes our experience with a private cloud, and discusses the design and implementation of a private cloud monitoring system (PCMONS) and its application via a case study for the proposed architecture. An important finding of this article is that is possible to deploy a private cloud within the organization using only open source solutions and integrating with traditional tools like Nagios. However, there is significant development work to be done while integrating these tools. With PCMONS we took the first steps toward this goal, opening paths for new development opportunities as well as making PCMONS itself an open-source tool.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, data communication networks have grown to immense size and have been diversified by the mobile revolution. Existing management solutions are based on a centralized deterministic paradigm, which is appropriate for networks of moderate size operating in relatively stable conditions. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that these management solutions are not able to cope with the large dynamic networks that are emerging. In this article, we argue that the adoption of a decentralized and probabilistic paradigm for network management will be crucial to meet the challenges of future networks, such as efficient resource usage, scalability, robustness, and adaptability. We discuss the potential of decentralized probabilistic management and its impact on management operations, and illustrate the paradigm by three example solutions for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.",

      "abstract": "The operation of cellular network infrastructure incurs significant electrical energy consumption. From the perspective of cellular network operators, reducing this consumption is not only a matter of showing environmental responsibility, but also of substantially reducing their operational expenditure. We discuss how dynamic operation of cellular base stations, in which redundant base stations are switched off during periods of low traffic such as at night, can provide significant energy savings. We quantitatively estimate these potential savings through a first-order analysis based on real cellular traffic traces and information regarding base station locations in a part of Manchester, United Kingdom. We also discuss a number of open issues pertinent to implementing such energy- efficient dynamic base station operation schemes, such as various approaches to ensure coverage, and interoperator coordination.",

      "abstract": "To rapidly meet increasing traffic demands from subscribers, the IEEE 802.3av task force was charged to study the 10G-EPON system to increase the data rate to 10 times the line rate of 1G-EPON. With the increase of the line rate, the energy consumption of 10G-EPON increases accordingly. Achieving low energy consumption with 10G-EPON has attracted broad research attention from both academia and industry. In this article we first briefly discuss the key features of 10G-EPON. Then, from the perspective of MAC-layer control and scheduling, we discuss challenges and possible solutions to put optical network units into low-power mode for energy saving. More specifically, we detail sleep-mode control and sleep-aware traffic scheduling schemes in two scenarios: sleep for over one DBA cycle, and sleep within one DBA cycle.",

Many variants or combinations of such methodologies have been introduced continuously to improve the classification accuracy and efficiency. However, the level of classification details is often bounded to identifying protocols or applications in use. In this article, we propose a fine-grained traffic classification scheme based on the analysis of existing classification methodologies. This scheme allows to classify traffic according to the functionalities in an application. In particular, we present a traffic classifier which utilizes a document retrieval technique and applies multiple signatures to detect the peer-to-peer application traffic according to different functionalities in it. We show that the proposed scheme can provide more in-depth classification results for analyzing user contexts.",

      "abstract": "This article gives an overview on the state of the art of the different options to save energy in copper-based broadband access nodes while maintaining performance and QoS. The main focus is on the potential energy saving in the physical layer and the access network architecture. We show that today the physical layer, when not optimized properly, is one of the main sources of energy consumption in copper-based access networks. On one hand this is due to the intrinsic high attenuation of the copper lines, and on the other hand to the different noise sources like electromagnetic coupling between lines in the same cable. The redesign of the access network by moving from a centralized network architecture to a more distributed network architecture, although initially driven by capacity increase needs, can be positioned as an energy efficiency enabler in the access nodes. It can be shown that under reasonable assumptions between 30 and 200 GWh per year can be saved globally. Some discussion and comparison of copper and fiber-based access networks from the \"green angle\" revealed that although FTTH can offer higher bandwidth at lower power, using the proper copper-based access network architecture is still able to come close on both aspects.",

      "abstract": "The advanced metering infrastructure of the smart grid presents the biggest growth potential in the machine-to-machine market today. Spurred by recent advances in M2M technologies, SG smart meters are expected not to require human intervention in characterizing power requirements and energy distribution. However, there are many challenges in the design of the SG communications network whereby the electrical appliances and smart meters are able to exchange information pertaining to varying power requirements. Furthermore, different types of M2M gateways are required at different points (e.g., at home, in the building, at the neighborhood, and so forth) of the SG communication network. This article surveys a number of existing communication technologies that can be adopted for M2M communication in SG. Among these, the most reliable technology to facilitate M2M communication in the SG home area network is pointed out, and its shortcoming is also noted. Furthermore, a possible solution to deal with this shortcoming to improve SG communications scalability is also presented.",

      "abstract": "To enable full mechanical automation where each smart device can play multiple roles among sensor, decision maker, and action executor, it is essential to construct scrupulous connections among all devices. Machine-to-machine communications thus emerge to achieve ubiquitous communications among all devices. With the merit of providing higher-layer connections, scenarios of 3GPP have been regarded as the promising solution facilitating M2M communications, which is being standardized as an emphatic application to be supported by LTE-Advanced. However, distinct features in M2M communications create diverse challenges from those in human-to-human communications. To deeply understand M2M communications in 3GPP, in this article, we provide an overview of the network architecture and features of M2M communications in 3GPP, and identify potential issues on the air interface, including physical layer transmissions, the random access procedure, and radio resources allocation supporting the most critical QoS provisioning. An effective solution is further proposed to provide QoS guarantees to facilitate M2M applications with inviolable hard timing constraints.",

      "abstract": "Traffic information systems are one of the key non-safety application areas of vehicular ad hoc networks. As such, TIS are much less delay sensitive than safety applications, which have recently attracted a lot of attention in VANET research. We propose a new message dissemination protocol, Adaptive Traffic Beacon (ATB), which is fully distributed and uses adaptive beaconing based on two key metrics: message utility and channel quality. It is shown that adaptive beaconing leads to much broader dissemination of messages (in terms of penetration rate) than flooding-based approaches, albeit at a slower rate. Adaptive beaconing thus seems to be much more suitable for TIS than flooding-based protocols.",

A wide variety of technologies have been proposed recently with different characteristics for diverse application environments. Such emerging technologies can be applied \u2014 depending on their specific features \u2014 to different e-health use cases. Additionally, some of those technologies have already adopted a path to medical device interoperability, while others are on their way to enable that potential. Hence the need to perform an overview of such technologies, which can be useful when designing interoperable, wireless-enabled e-health solutions. This article therefore reviews the emerging technologies that can be incorporated into the complex e-health information communication ecosystem and details the transport technologies that have adopted a specialized medical profile for ISO/IEEE 11073 interoperability such as USB, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. Discussion is focused on the expected path of novel emerging technologies toward ISO/IEEE 11073-compliant medical device interoperability. As a result, this article provides an up-to-date guideline for designers of standard-compliant wireless-enabled e-health architectures, helping in the selection of the appropriate technology for their designs.",

While there are several existing broadcast routing protocols for highway VANETs, very few solutions exist for urban VANETs in cities like New York City or Chicago. This article attempts to fill this gap by proposing a new broadcast routing protocol, Urban Vehicular BroadCAST (UV-CAST), which addresses both the broadcast storm and disconnected network problems in urban VANETs. Key challenges imposed by urban VANETs as well as new mechanisms needed for meeting these challenges are identified and presented. Performance of the proposed UV-CAST protocol is evaluated in terms of network reachability, received distance, and network overhead in ideal Manhattan Street scenarios as well as in real cities, such as Pittsburgh. The overall performance of UV-CAST is excellent.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum access has proposed tiering radios into two groups: primary users and secondary users. PUs are assumed to have reserved spectrum available to them, while SUs (operating in overlay mode) must share whatever spectrum is available. The threat of emulation attacks, in which users pretend to be of a type they are not (either PU or SU) in order to gain unauthorized access to spectrum, has the potential to severely degrade the expected performance of the system. We analyze this problem within a Bayesian game framework, in which users are unsure of the legitimacy of the claimed type of other users. We show that depending on radios' beliefs about the fraction of PUs in the system, a policy maker can control the occurrence of emulation attacks by adjusting the gains and costs associated with performing or checking for emulation attacks.",

      "abstract": "Frequency-agile radio systems need to decide which frequencies are safe to use. In the context of recycling spectrum that may already be in use by primary users, both the spatial dimension to the spectrum sensing problem and the role of wireless fading are critical. It turns out that the traditional hypothesis testing framework for evaluating sensing misses both of these and thereby gives misleading intuitions. A unified framework is presented here in which the natural ROC curve correctly captures the two features desired from a spectrum sensing system: safety to primary users and performance for the secondary users. It is the trade-off between these two that is fundamental. The spectrum holes being sensed also span both time and space. The single-radio energy detector is used to illustrate the tension between the performance in time and the performance in space for a fixed value of protection to the primary user.",

      "abstract": "This article describes the use of IEEE 1588 and boundary clocks for clock distribution (phase/time transfer) in telecom networks. The technology is primarily used to serve the radio interface synchronization requirements of mobile systems such as WiMAX and LTE, and to reduce the deployment and dependence of GPS systems in base stations. We discuss the most important functions that are necessary for phase/time transfer and present some initial field trial results using a chain of cascaded boundary clocks and synchronous Ethernet links across a packet and optical transport network that spans tens of kilometers and tens of network elements. The results indicate that it is possible to transfer accurate phase/time in a telecom network and meet the requirements of mobile systems. The article also discusses some of the challenges and highlights the ongoing activities in standardization bodies so that IEEE 1588 can be used as a technology in telecom networks.",

      "abstract": "Taking advantage of the multimode ability of modern mobile terminals, cellular operators are investing in alternate access networks (e.g., IEEE802.11 and IEEE802.16) to complement the increasingly overloaded cellular accesses. Complementing this, IP mobility support is gradually being introduced into network architectures, providing session continuity. To facilitate and optimize handover procedures between different access technologies in a seamless way, the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover Services standard provides technology agnostic mechanisms to obtain information and control link layers. Implementations of the standard are appearing, but since support of IEEE 802.21 primitives directly at the link driver level is not yet realized, they have to revert to proprietary wrapping mechanisms or use specific operating system solutions to circumvent this issue. In this article we present ODTONE, an IEEE 802.21 implementation that is operating-system-independent and open source, and offers a novel approach to interfacing with different link layers that facilitates the deployment of IEEE 802.21 mobility mechanisms in multiple scenarios. We present a scenario where we integrate our middleware with an IP mobility management protocol, Proxy MIP IPv6, highlighting ODTONE\u00bfs supporting features and impact while providing an open handover control architecture for network- based localized mobility management.",

In this article, we analyze the implications of hosting a BitTorrent proxy on a broadband router, which pushes the content to a mobile phone over wireless radio (WLAN or 3G). The amount of memory in a router is limited; therefore, our interest is in how to efficiently use memory to download BitTorrent content as fast as possible and at the same time transfer it to the mobile phone in an energy-efficient way. We investigate these aspects via a series of measurements. The results show that the proxy-based solution outperforms the torrent client running on the phone in terms of energy and download time. We also simulate the BitTorrent operation to understand how these memory-limited devices would influence the operation of the whole community.",

      "abstract": "In the field of grid computing over optical networks, joint scheduling of computing and network resources is an important issue. However previous research efforts were static approaches, which are difficult to implement in multidomain optical networks, especially in public carriers' networks with lots of dynamic background traffic. In this article we put forward that optical network virtualization can be a possible solution to the above mentioned problems. We analyze the benefits and challenges of joint scheduling over a virtualized optical network (VON) across multiple domains and discuss the impacts of dedicated and shared VON provisioning on scheduling problems. Then we propose a VON service composition framework for grid applications, which is different from traditional interdomain routing protocol. Finally, we show the feasibility of our proposal through simulation and an experimental demonstration over a field trial optical network testbed.",

      "abstract": "Ambient assisted living (AAL) services that provide support for people to remain in their homes are increasingly being used in healthcare systems around the world. Typically, these ambient assisted living services provide additional information though location-awareness, presence-awareness, and context-awareness capabilities, arising from the prolific use of telecommunications devices including sensors and actuators in the home of the person receiving care. In addition there is a need to provide abstract information, in context, to local and remote stakeholders. There are many different viewing options utilizing converged networks and the resulting explosion in data and information has resulted in a new problem, as these new ambient assisted living services struggle to convey meaningful information to different groups of end users. The article discusses visualization of data from the perspective of the needs of the differing end user groups, and discusses how algorithms are required to contextualize and convey information across location and time. In order to illustrate the issues, current work on nighttime AAL services for people with dementia is described.",

The two WiMAX authentication mechanisms (PKM versions 1 and 2) are discussed and a number of aspects affecting their authentication capabilities presented. Of particular n4056792ote is the handling of digital certificates and the lack of multiple certificate authority support. This lack essentially prevents the interoperability of WiMAX devices produced by different manufactures. Proposed recommendations are presented that should improve how WiMAX authentication operates and allow for mixed manufacturer device interoperability.",

The ease of deployment of Wi-Fi has made it ubiquitous in densely populated urban areas, and it was just a matter of time before wireless communities emerged. Using inexpensive wireless technology to communicate, autonomous wireless internetworks have been built, offering a variety of broadband services. Based on our own experience participating in one of the largest wireless communities worldwide, the Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network, we attempt to explain their structure and mechanisms, study the reasons for their emergence and growth, and predict their future evolution. We expect that future wireless communities will be oriented toward providing broadband access to nomadic users. To this end, we have proposed that wireless network access be shared in a peer-to-peer, reciprocal manner. Thus, ubiquitous broadband Internet access can be achieved at a low cost, at least in metropolitan areas where there is abundant wireless coverage, providing an inexpensive alternative to broadband cellular services.",

      "abstract": "Currently there is a very fundamental change happening in spectrum regulation, possibly the most fundamental ever in its history. This is the enabling of spectrum sharing, where primary (licensed) users of the spectrum, are forced to allow sharing with secondary users, who use license-exempt equipment. Such sharing is free for the secondary users, subject to the condition that they do not cause harmful interference to the primary users. The first instance of such sharing is occurring with the UHF digital TV spectrum, in what is commonly called TV white space. Regulators such as the FCC in the United States and Ofcom in the United Kingdom have indicated that other spectrum will follow suit. Cognitive radio is an enabling technology that allows such sharing. Following recent rulings by FCC and Ofcom and the emergence of a series of related industry standards, CR operation in TVWS is moving from the research domain towards implementation and commercialization, with use-cases that are of interest to telecom operators. In this article we describe three such use cases: future home networks, coverage of the street from inside buildings, and broadband access to rural and underserved premises. We present results of modeling and trials of technical feasibility, undertaken by the Innovate and Design team at BT. Based on our experience we draw conclusions regarding the feasibility and commercial importance of these use cases, and identify some of the remaining technical and commercial challenges.",

      "abstract": "This article is motivated by the recent recognition that channel fading for new wireless applications is not always well described by traditional models used for mobile communication systems. In particular, fading data collected for vehicleto- vehicle and wireless sensor network applications has motivated new models for conditions in which channel fading statistics can be worse than Rayleigh. We review the use of statistical channel models, describe our example applications, and provide both measured and modeling results for these severe fading conditions.",

      "abstract": "Live satellite news gathering services, featuring real-time streaming of high-quality video, are typically enabled via expensive SNG vehicles and satellite transmissions by TV news companies. With advances in broadband wireless access technologies, delivering live news broadcasting service over broadband wireless networks will become a reality. However, LNB services demand high video fidelity and may consume excessive uplink bandwidth in wireless networks. In addition, the channel condition of terrestrial wireless links between mobile nodes and base stations may vary with time and location, rendering quality of service for LNB services unstable, which is most undesirable to TV news companies. In this article, we share our experience of implementing a novel, cost-effective system called i-SNG for LNB services, under deployment for an M-Taiwan project by a TV company in Taiwan. Specifically, we aggregate bandwidth from locally available heterogeneous wireless networks by employing multilink SCTP, together with Concurrent Multipath Transfer, to cope with limitations in today's network environments. We then perform experiments over a test-bed with different network settings. The experimental results show that, compared with existing solutions, the proposed i-SNG system has superior performance in terms of higher throughput and better perceptual quality, making it an excellent solution for cost-effective LNB services. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses SCTP-based CMT for bandwidth aggregation in real-time video transmissions.",
