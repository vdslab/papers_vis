      "abstract": "NTT is aggressively promoting the deployment of fiber to the home in Japan in order to deploy broadband services. The demand for high-speed Internet access has been increasing rapidly. Until migration from metallic cables to optical fiber is complete, NTT needs to develop technology that can provide high-speed access over the existing metallic cable. We believe that high-speed subscriber transmission systems operating on the existing phone lines, in addition to fiber optic lines, will accelerate the deployment of broadband services. This article discusses the technical issues of deploying ADSL in Japan.",

It can be suppressed by employing buffer memories in the network; however, cell delay occurs as a consequence. This article proposes a lossless handover method for mobile ATM communication networks that both prevents cell loss and can suppress cell delay variation. The method was simulated on an experimental system to subjectively evaluate MPEG2 images relative to buffer memory size and the results obtained are presented.",

      "abstract": "The success of new service provision platforms will largely depend on their ability to blend with existing technologies. The advent of Internet telephony, although impressive, is unlikely to make telephone customers suddenly turn in favor of computers. Rather, customers display increasing interest in services that span multiple networks (especially Internet protocol-based networks and the telephone and cellular networks) and open new vistas. We refer to these services as hybrid services and propose an architecture for their provision. This architecture allows for programming the service platform elements (i.e., network nodes, gateways, control servers, and terminals) in order to include new service logics. We identify components that can be assembled to build these logics by considering a service as a composition of features such as address translation, security, call control, connectivity, charging, and user interaction. Generic service components are derived from the modeling of these features. We assure that our proposal can be implemented even in existing systems in return for slight changes. These systems are required to generate an event when a special service is encountered. The treatment of this event is handled by an object at a Java service layer. Java has been chosen for its platform-neutrality property and its embedded security mechanisms. Using our architecture, we design a hybrid closed user group service.",

Bit errors in typical satellite transmissions occur in bursts, and that should be taken into account when designing satellite ATM networks.

      "abstract": "Satellite-switched code-division multiple access is a system proposed for geostationary fixed satellite service. SS/CDMA provides both multiple access and switching to a multibeam satellite. In this article we present the system architecture and performance. The SS/CDMA consist of the common air interface (CAI) and the onboard code switching mechanism. The CAI provides signaling control and traffic channels. Traffic channel access and modulation is based on a spectrally efficient CDMA scheme. The satellite code-division switch (CDS) routes calls from an uplink to a downlink beam without onboard demodulation and channel decoding. This system operates with demand assignment control; that is, channel bandwidth and switch connections are only assigned per user request. The system can offer a wide variety of bit rates with wireline quality of service. The services provided are circuit-switched calls for voice data and video, and packet-switched for data. As shown, the proposed SE-CDMA can achieve high capacity and very low bit error rates at low signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the innovative switching technique can provide low complexity and achieve high throughput for all services.",

Myriad satellite networks have been announced that are expected to provide a vast repertoire of satellite-enabled telecommunications as well as global broadband access to the Internet. These constellations of satellites will compete for spectrum, as well as for orbital positions, and will introduce widespread RF interference among themselves as well as into the arena of terrestrial wireless communications.

      "abstract": "This article describes a novel architecture of a broadband radio access network using the two-layer network solution. The proposed downlink is compliant with the DVB-S standards, and a DECT custom solution is used in the return channel. The idea we present is based on the use of a \"single carrier with equalization\" system in order to directly link the end-user terminal, avoiding the most expensive part of the cabling network: the last mile. The article reports, some considerations concerning the advantages and disadvantages of the novel architecture. Successively, aspects such as frequency plan, architecture of the base station, local repeater, and user terminal, in combination with some practical studies, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This article describes a wireless local loop system based on wideband CDMA technology. The unique features of CDMA technology make it a formidable alternative for fixed wireless telephone applications. The W-CDMA technology used by this WLL system is selected to provide primarily ISDN-like services and data rates to subscribers. This technology also provides a smooth transition into the third generation wireless technology. The air interface used in this WLL system is an interim TTA standard, which specifies a CDMA-based protocol operating in the 2.30-2.40 GHz band. The standard allows two types of bandwidth (5 and 10 MHz). The WLL system described in this article includes the WLL gateway switch, the radio port controller and the radio interface unit. The gateway switch connects the radio system to the PSTN and ISDN. The RPC provides concentration and control functions to a number of base stations called RPs. The RIU is comprised of the fixed units attached to the residential or commercial buildings. Also included are the radio port operation and maintenance (RPOM) unit, which is responsible for maintaining and managing the radio network elements, and the interworking function unit, which is used as a gateway to data services such as the Internet and PSPDN.",

      "abstract": "Since the slice is the basic reconstruction unit at the display device, the MPEG-2-based video traffic in an ATM network is treated as many slice flows. For a real-time MPEG-2-based video service, the most important restriction is that all cells in a slice flow must be transmitted to their destination node completely before the deadline; otherwise, they should be dropped totally. The main purpose of this article is to propose a flow-oriented input-queued ATM switching router architecture with a scheduling strategy, MCL-MSL, taking advantage of the above characteristics to achieve higher-quality video services and more efficient utilization of network bandwidth. If the needed bandwidth for transmitting slice flows exceeds the available network bandwidth, MCL-MSL selects the slice flow with minimum slice loss for transmission. Furthermore, if multiple choices exist, it selects the one with maximum cell loss among them to achieve the most efficient bandwidth utilization.",

The UMTS, a member of the IMT-2000 family of systems, will offer global universal services up to 2 Mb/s for the mass market in the near future. For users demanding more capacity for \"bit-hungry\" high-quality applications, broadband mobile radio access systems are being developed, such as wireless LANs and the Mobile Broadband System. In this article broadband mobile systems are classified, taking into account services and quality, spectrum, and standardization issues. The practical experiences gained in two European research projects-ATM Wireless Access Communication System (AWACS) and System for Advanced Mobile Broadband Applications (SAMBA)-are described. Finally, a realistic look at possible future deployment is given.",

As an example, we describe SR3, a collision-free slotted MAC protocol which combines a packet scheduling strategy (called SRR), a fairness control algorithm (called MMR); and a reservation mechanism. SRR achieves an efficient exploitation of the available bandwidth, MMR guarantees fair throughput access to each node, and SR3, by permitting slot reservations, leads to tighter control on access delays, and can thus effectively support traffic classes with different QoS requirements.",

Defined at the network level, between operations systems of different TMN domains, it is intended as a support for the management of broadband connectivity services with end-to-end QoS and scheduling constraints in backbones operated by many network operators. The key feature of the present approach, distinguishing it from other existing Xcoop solutions, is in handling the integrated ATM and SDH technologies, covering both the configuration management and fault management functional areas.",

The digital subsystem is tested using extensions of the IEEE 1149.1 boundary scan standard to verify connections within circuit boards and between boards. The RF subsystem is tested using a loopback connection between the RF transmitter and receiver. An RF parametric self-test is performed using a digitally modulated signal (as opposed to a sinusoidal tone) as the test stimulus, and using samples from the receiver digitizer as test data. This loopback test scheme imposes a relatively small overhead on the RF system design.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a trace-driven analysis of IP over ATM services from an ATM-centric standpoint. We provide a characterization of TCP flows as VBR streams with burstiness (MBS) and throughput (SCR). On the other hand, a macroscopic analysis comprising percentage of flows and bytes per service, TCP average transaction duration, and bytes transferred both ways is also presented. The ATM link under analysis concentrates traffic from a large population of 1500 hosts from the Public University of Navarra campus network, that produce 1,700,000 TCP connections approximately in the measurement period of one week. The results obtained from such a wealth of data indicate that the sustained throughput of Web connections does not grow beyond 80 kb/s with 70 percent probability in the data transfer phase (i.e., in the established state), and we observe a strong influence of the connection establishment phase on the user-perceived throughput. On the other hand, the burstiness of individual TCP connections is rather small; namely, TCP connections do not produce bursts according to the geometric law given by slow start and commonly assumed in previously published studies.",

      "abstract": "In this article we focus on the transport and switching part of third-generation mobile access networks and outline some important aspects of applying ATM in these networks. In particular, we argue that in order for the mobile access network to support low-bit-rate delay-sensitive traffic consisting of short packets, the standardization of a new ATM adaptation layer, AAL2, and associated signaling protocol has been necessary. The AAL2 protocol has been designed to support low-bit-rate delay-sensitive services (typically compressed voice) where other adaptation layers fail to deliver the required QoS and maintain efficient resource utilization at the same time. Furthermore, in order to provide mobility and soft handover support in W-CDMA-based mobile networks such as UMTS or IMT-2000, there is also a strong demand for fast connection establishment and release. Therefore, when designing ATM-based cellular access networks some specific architectural and traffic management issues need to be addressed.",

      "abstract": "The technological revolution witnessed by the telecommunications industry is leading to the development of new applications, products, and protocols, which in turn solicits widely accessible, highly reliable, and high-quality networks. To meet the stringent quality and reliability requirements of today's complex communication networks, efficient test methodologies are necessary at all levels (system, board, circuit, etc.). Conventional test methodologies are being constantly challenged by ever-increasing speed and circuit size, which results in high costs associated with test hardware, test generation, and test application time. Built-in self-test offers a test methodology where the test functions are embedded into the circuit itself. The advantages of using BIST for complex telecommunication systems are numerous. Reduced test development time, low test application time, eliminating the need for very-high-speed hardware testers, provision for at-speed tests, in-field test capability, and high fault coverage are some of them. In this article we present a tutorial on the BIST methodology targeted mainly toward telecommunication systems, the test structures necessary for its incorporation both at the circuit and system levels, and test implementation at the higher levels of design abstraction.",

      "abstract": "A new generation of wireless transceivers is being intergrated into CMOS IC technology, which so far has been used mainly to realize digital and mixed analog-digital baseband circuits. This article reviews some of the RF CMOS circuit design techniques, and shows how an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these circuits influences choice of radio architecture. The CMOS approach to radio design calls for the elimination of discrete components in favor of high levels of on-chip integration which freely use translators and mix analog and digital functionality; in these respects, it departs from traditional RF circuit practices. Successful wireless devices of the future will require that radio system design evolve around these new trends in RF integration.",

To develop these system ICs in a timely manner, traditional IC design in which everything is designed from scratch, is replaced by a design style based on embedding large reusable modules, the so-called cores. Effectively, the design of a core-based IC is partitioned over the core provider(s) and the system-chip integrator. The development of tests should follow the same partitioning. We describe the differences between traditional and core-based test development, and present an overview of current industrial approaches. We list the future challenges regarding standardization, tool development, and academic and industrial research.",

      "abstract": "Advances in analog and digital telecommunications technology have provided us with a wide range of telecommunications networks since the invention of the analog telephony network by Bell in 1876, such as wireless and wired CATV networks, local, metropolitan, and wide area networks, and the Internet; and a range of protocols to go with these networks, such as Internet Protocol or ATM. Charging for services delivered across these networks has always been an issue of major concern to providers and users of telecommunications services. The ability to charge accurately and efficiently for a service is directly related to the potential quality, value, flexibility, and customer care available to the customer, and, equally important, provides a means of survival, growth, and profitability to the provider. ATM is becoming a significant carrier of telecommunications services because its technology can accommodate a wide variety of services such as multimedia on demand, voice services, or videoconferencing, demanded by today's rapidly changing market. While there are many schemes in use for the charging of mobile and fixed telephony, the area of Internet charging and, in particular, ATM charging is relatively uncharted to date. In this article we address the challenge of developing methods of charging for ATM services, and show solutions in the form of technical and commercial recommendations and a practical implementation of these recommendations.",

The 50th anniversary of information theory is an opportunity to briefly present the biography of this man and the development of one of his most fruitful concepts: that of forward error-correction schemes from a pure mathematical curiosity to an important discipline in computer and communications engineering.",

      "abstract": "The voice-grade telephone channel is the communication medium most widely available throughout the world. Its limitations, a relatively narrow bandwidth and a moderate SNR figure, have challenged telecommunication researchers and engineers over several decades to develop technologies able to pass higher and higher data rates. The sophisticated combination of trellis coding and quadrature amplitude modulation increases the bandwidth utilization close to the Shannon limit of 10 b/s/Hz for the 3.1 kHz bandwidth voice channel. However, the resultant data rate of about 30 kb/s does not even begin to approach the throughput needed by multimedia applications. Fortunately, twisted pair bandwidth reaches up to several megahertz, so multilevel signaling implemented as in the xDSF family of modems enables data rates of several megabits per second to be reached. Standard ADSL modems are able to deliver 8 Mb/s to a subscriber in the best case. VDSL modems can deliver 52 Mb/s, but only up to 300 m, so their mass implementation will only become possible when fiber migrates into an access network closer to the user premises. Both broadband xDSL solutions approach the Shannon limit and the related spectral efficiency as well, so there is not much room left for a transmission improvement.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing radio-based applications in software. The new architecture for implementing mobile telephony base stations has the potential of offering many benefits: great cost savings by using one transceiver per base transceiver station (BTS) instead of one per channel, tremendous flexibility by moving system-specific parameters to the digital part, and allowing the support of a wide range of modulation and coding schemes. A very important problem in designing software radio applications is the need to estimate the required complexity of processing to dimension systems. For example, with a software GSM BTS it is critical to estimate the number of channels that can be supported by a given processor configuration, and to predict the impact of future processor enhancements on its capacity. This article focuses on the design of a software implementation of a GSM BTS and proposes a platform-independent evaluation of its computational requirements based on SPEC benchmarks. It focuses on the design and performance of a library of software modules. Portability and computational requirements are discussed.",

A new option has become available: field programmable gate arrays. FPGA-based DSP platforms allow the designer to realize a data path that exactly matches the required processing, while at the same time maintaining the flexibility of a software approach. This article presents an overview of some FPGA DSP applications. Several filter designs are presented, and the use of CORDIC arithmetic for constructing an FPGA carrier recovery loop is outlined. In addition to presenting design examples that can be realized using present-generation devices and tools, we take a brief look at how the dynamic reconfiguration aspect of certain FPGAs could be exploited in future-generation communication technologies.",

It is argued that analog implementations of such decoders can be much more efficient than digital implementations. This article gives a tutorial introduction to research on this topic. It is estimated that analog decoders can outperform digital decoders by two orders of magnitude in speed and/or power consumption.",

Routers in the backbone could still be the potential bottleneck. In this article we consider some design issues of high-throughput optical routers which combine the advantages of WDM with the new optical switching technology. We first introduce a proposed Internet architecture based on the optical burst switching mechanism. Some important design issues in optical buffering and control function are addressed which are expected to have significant effects on router performance. Numerical results of a simulation study are also presented along with discussions.",

In this article, selected aspects of projects with the Vatican Library, the National Gallery of Art (United States), the Klau Library of Hebrew Union College, and Russia's State Hermitage Museum are reported. In these projects, both technical and institutional challenges were met. Three technical challenges are discussed: protecting the intellectual property rights of institutions to their online materials; producing high-quality images with data sizes that are suitable for Internet delivery; and achieving significant capture throughput. Finally, some opinions are offered on the outlook for digital libraries of cultural content.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary digital communication systems such as those being developed for the deployment of third-generation cellular require ever increasing performance levels in their signal processing chains to extract higher data rates and to provide decreasing price/performance ratios. Additionally, communication systems like 3G that must support multimode flexibility, such as the software radio, must be able to reconfigure their signal processing chains while keeping circuit complexity to a minimum. Given these constraints, DSP is the only viable alternative for baseband processing and digital IF processing. DSP is in many cases the only viable alternative to analog IF processing. Digital IF affords greater flexibility and higher performance in terms of attenuation and selectivity. It also offers better time and environment stability and lower equipment production costs than traditional analog techniques.",

Simple but practical examples are used to illustrate the various improvement techniques. Using the described methods, the inherent accuracy and linearity of the data conversion can be extended from about 10 bits to 16 bits and more.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a new high-speed network architecture called dynamic burst transfer time-slot-base network (DBTN). The DBTN network is based on circuit-switched network technology. A routing tag is attached to a burst at an ingress edge node and the burst is self-routed in a DBTN network, the circuit of which is created dynamically by the routing tag. The routing tag, which is called time-slots-relay, consists of link identifiers from the ingress to the egress nodes and is used to create the circuit. Subsequent data is switched over the circuit being created in an on-the-fly fashion. Each link identifier is loaded into the address control memory (ACM) of each circuit switching node, and thereby the circuit to the destination is created dynamically. Subsequent user data follows immediately after the time-slots-relay and is sent over the established circuit. Thus short-lived fairly large data transfers such as WWW traffic are efficiently carried. A circuit between adjacent nodes is created and released dynamically so bandwidth efficiency is improved compared with conventional circuit-switched networks. Time division multiplexing of the circuit-switched network is utilized so there is no delay jitter or loss within a burst. We address the performance of DBTN switches and report the experimental system.",

This is to provide millions of residential and business customers worldwide with high-speed always-on connectivity to the Internet, corporate intranets, and various online services. It is estimated that over 460 million copper loops worldwide could potentially be equipped end-to-end with xDSL access systems. Large-scale deployment of broadband access systems offering always-on connectivity to the global Internet and corporate intranets is seen as a key enabler of the bold vision articulated worldwide to utilize open Internet protocols and emerging technologies such as Java to create a unified software-defined (IP) global networking infrastructure. Such a networking platform would serve as a de facto medium for generation and delivery of integrated multimedia content, and revolutionize the way people around the world learn, do business, and interact with each other.",

      "abstract": "For a number of years, the network, software, and telecommunication industries have been working on a number of key technical issues dealing with the infrastructure support for hybrid services. From the end users' perspectives, hybrid services utilize various networks while hiding the underlying network technologies such as the wireless networks, phone system, and data networks. To this end, however, the data networks lack necessary power to support next-generation hybrid services. It is now generally understood that there is great value in creating a three-level network model with the middle level supporting a service platform that would contribute certain common services. Such a data network would provide the common services at its edges close to its points of presence (POPs) while maintaining control over all network components belonging to a specific network provider. It would interoperate with other networks to offer a uniform view and management of all hybrid services. This article describes the nature of the enhanced emerging networks and outlines the structure of a service platform that would support its functions.",

      "abstract": "In the transmission process of a variable bit rate video signal over an ATM network, cells are inevitably exposed to delays and losses due to the statistical multiplexing used in these networks. These phenomena affect the quality of the video signal, and without adequate measures to control the propagation of impairments, the quality of service may fall below acceptable levels. We introduce a set of control mechanisms at different levels of the protocol architecture to support MPEG-2 based video communications systems using ATM networks as their underlying transmission mechanism. We argue that in order to be able to create video systems able to cope with cell losses encountered in computer communications systems, a structured set of protocol mechanisms is required. Our results show the effectiveness of the proposed set of mechanisms in improving the robustness of the video delivery system.",

      "abstract": "It is expected that the explosion in Internet traffic implies a paradigm shift from a voice network to a data-centric network. The first and most important requirement of future transport networks is the large bandwidth transport capability which enables the paradigm shift. In addition, requirements for new service attributes are becoming more tangible. Furthermore, high reliability will be indispensable because the multimedia network will be the basis for the information society. To develop the robust and efficient networks that satisfy the requirements above, new network architectures and technologies should be developed. Photonic networks employing dense WDM technologies appear to be the solution. In this article, first the basic concept of the future photonic network is depicted. Next, the capability of large-capacity fiber transmission is shown. The critical degradation factor of fiber nonlinearity is analyzed, and the effectiveness of distributed amplification is quantitatively demonstrated. Furthermore, advances in fiber amplifiers which greatly widen the usable fiber window are shown. Other key technologies such as absolute frequency referencing and multiple channel frequency management techniques are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The architecture of today's long distance transmission networks, which we call the baseline architecture, is a complex and multilayered hierarchy of TDM circuits. One premise of the baseline architecture is that restoration from network failures is provided mostly by SONET/SDH rings. This article presents an alternative architecture that uses ATM and optical layer cross-connect technology for TDM services. Using a sophisticated set of network design tools developed at AT&amp;T Labs-Research, we show that the alternative architecture offers dramatic capital savings and improved network efficiency over the baseline architecture. Most of this savings can be attributed to use of OLXC mesh network restoration, which makes more efficient use of capacity than SONET/SDH rings, and use of ATM switching for transport of TDM circuits, which consolidates the numerous TDM equipment layers inherent to the baseline architecture. In addition, motivated by the rapid growth of IP services, we analyze in the alternative architecture whether to provide restoration for IP services in the IP layer itself, by rerouting packets over precalculated restoration paths with MPLS, or to alternatively provide restoration of failed IP layer links in the OLXC layer. One potential advantage of IP layer restoration is that network operators may choose to only restore a fraction of the services, in particular the \"priority\" services, affected by a network failure. This article gives some methodology of how to determine this fraction at which IP layer restoration is cost-competitive with OLXC restoration.",

      "abstract": "The Global Megamedia Network is a network service concept developed by NTT to be the key component in its information-sharing business strategy. The concept gives the architecture for providing full-fledged multimedia services during the next decade. It will be used to construct a high-throughput secure networking environment in which advanced multimedia services will be provided to customers in an easy and comfortable to use manner at an affordable cost. The GMN concept proposes the deployment of flexible and high-quality service provision platforms that enable high-performance networking (real-time transfer of megabytes of information), provide high functionality to make multimedia communications easy and comfortable, and provide services at about the same cost as existing telephony. This article first analyzes the market trends and customer needs we are facing in Japan. Then the GMN services concept and the network architecture for deploying services are explained. GMN-CL technologies are explained as the first step in developing full-fledged GMN services. Finally, NTT R&amp;D's testbed network, called GEMnet, is described and the results of field trials are presented.",

Nevertheless, today the number of wireless data subscribers is small, with the most formidable obstacle to user acceptance being the performance limitations of existing services and products. This article discusses combining enhanced data rates for CSM evolution (EDGE) with wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing in an asymmetrical solution to provide high-speed data rates, with wide-area coverage and good quality, for wireless packet data services.",

      "abstract": "A rich set of broadband access copper technologies is available in the market today, and more are coming out of the laboratories, rapidly moving to standardization. The most likely future scenario will be one where many different technologies coexist. This multi-access-technology paradigm poses an interesting internetworking problem where interoperability and capability to support today's and future user services play a major role in the design of a network architecture. This article begins with an overview of current and new xDSL access technologies to continue describing an access network design that harmonizes the interconnection between PON, xDSL, and native ATM transport technologies. The use of ATM technology for the interface to the broadband access and transport networks is then presented and justified. The article continues studying the protocol architectures proposed for access to network service providers, considered a driver application for broadband access deployment. Finally, different protocol architectures that can provide integrated services support at the user equipment are analyzed.",

      "abstract": "The changing business scenario for telecommunication services requires higher levels of openness compared to current technologies. The realization of a programmable and open network intelligence fosters the transition toward an open telecom market. This extended openness is requested to allow flexible component-based service integration; extended control/management capabilities are needed for new electronic business infrastructure, more service personalization and programmability, and integration and management of heterogeneous networks (Internet/B-ISDN/mobile, etc.). We present an integrated architecture for active and programmable networks and services based on the concept of an integrated service node. We study the business point of view, the B-ISDN/ATM point of view, and the Internet point of view. Each of these technologies is supported by an adapted and adaptive service node to introduce advanced service composition, control, and management capabilities. We present a possible implementation infrastructure, and discuss related issues.",

      "abstract": "Modern telecommunications systems are becoming increasingly complex, in both their internal construction and the degree of interconnectivity-and interdependence-between systems. This situation is exacerbated by regulatory demands for operator interworking and requirements for high-quality delivery to users. In this context, the crucial issue is the ability of systems to retain their operational state of high integrity. The number of integrity issues in such systems is vast, and these issues must be understood and managed throughout development, testing, interconnection, and maintenance. This article presents a framework for analyzing the integrity features of telecommunications systems, and elaborates on integrity-preserving policies that can be applied during system development and deployment. Moreover, a description of a case study based on ACTS project TRUMPET (DGXIIIB, AC112) is given.",

      "abstract": "In principle, the interaction of the resource reservation protocol (RSVP) and ATM should allow the IP level to benefit from some features of the ATM layer. The most interesting one is the native support of end-to-end quality of service provided by ATM. On the other hand, there are issues that must be clarified to define correct interworking: for example, the possible overlapping between the mechanisms used in the IP and ATM levels to support QoS, or the needed IP/ATM address resolution mechanism. This article proposes a solution to exploit ATM shortcut VCs supporting QoS in the Internet integrated services model. A straightforward enrichment to the RSVP protocol is defined, which only impacts the devices (hosts and routers) involved in the shortcut procedure. A mechanism for IP/ATM address resolution is provided, avoiding the use of other mechanisms such as NHRP. Special care has been taken to maintain compatibility with \"traditional\" RSVP hosts and routers.",

Using the telephone network or a similar low-speed network, an asymmetrical system can be implemented which offers interactive Internet services. Two such interactive data broadcast systems are described which have been implemented as demonstration platforms for interactive multimedia services; one is based on digital subcarrier techniques for analog television channels, the other on the MPEG-2 and DVB standards. The architecture of the hardware and software is presented, particularly the solutions available for carrying Internet datagrams over MPEG-2 transport systems. A multicast transport protocol with selectable reliability is described which is the basis of a generic distribution application. It exploits the potential benefits of direct broadcast satellites for delivering data to large groups of local caches.",

      "abstract": "The use of connection-oriented (CO) networks for the transport of IP traffic is seen to have value to both users and service providers. Given the expectation that most endpoint-generated traffic will be in the form of connectionless (CL) IP datagrams, we address the problem of how to internetwork a CL (IP) network with a CO network. CO networks can be packet-switched or circuit-switched. Examples of packet-switched CO networks include ATM and MPLS networks, in which resource reservations are made at the ATM or shim layer, and IP-switch-based networks, in which resource reservations are made at the IP layer. Examples of circuit-switched networks include SONET/SDH and WDM networks that consist of programmable optical crossconnects. We consider the internetworking problem for two modes of operation of CO networks: provisioned, in which connections are set up a priori, and switched, in which connections are set up on demand. The main focus of this article is on the more complex problem: the internetworking of CL IP networks with CO networks operated in a switched mode. Our solution consists of (i) interworking user plane protocols with protocol conversion in some cases instead of always using protocol encapsulation, (ii) interworking routing protocols by either simply having gateways know routing information of both networks or having all nodes know routing information of both networks, and (iii) interworking signaling protocols by using application- or transport-layer end-to-end handshakes to trigger connection setups through the CO network. We demonstrate throughput improvements with our integrated routing interworking scheme over the MPOA IP-ATM internetworking solution for two example networks.",

      "abstract": "Moore's (1965) law, which predicts that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every 18-24 months, has held remarkably well over three decades of semiconductor device production. Using historical data, a similar prediction is made for modem speeds, and in particular for the speed at which data can be transmitted over twisted wire pairs, where it is found that modem data rates have historically doubled every 1.9 years. This result suggests that rapid increases in bandwidth delivered to subscribers over the coming decades will have profound societal and economic effects, just as the development of the integrated circuit and the microprocessor have had. Nevertheless, the regulated aspect of telecommunications may limit the growth of bandwidth and the deployment of high-speed modems which deliver services over existing twisted wire pairs. The cable environment, which from a data transmission perspective is, generally speaking, less regulated, may allow for deployment of modems which support rates in excess of what is predicted by our Moore's law analogy. In this article we examine Moore's law as applied to modem technology, and how regulation may affect the deployment of broadband services.",

Since any label distribution protocol makes use of information obtained from the layer 3 routing protocol, and the routing protocol may not be loop-free, there is a possibility of an LSP forming a loop. This article focuses on MPLS loop prevention by which LSPs are prevented from forming loops.

      "abstract": "We introduce the concept of a light-tree in a wavelength-routed optical network. A light-tree is a point-to-multipoint generalization of a lightpath. A lightpath is a point-to-point all-optical wavelength channel connecting a transmitter at a source node to a receiver at a destination node. Lightpath communication can significantly reduce the number of hops (or lightpaths) a packet has to traverse; and this reduction can, in turn, significantly improve the network's throughput. We extend the lightpath concept by incorporating an optical multicasting capability at the routing nodes in order to increase the logical connectivity of the network and further decrease its hop distance. We refer to such a point-to-multipoint extension as a light-tree. Light-trees can not only provide improved performance for unicast traffic, but they naturally can better support multicast traffic and broadcast traffic. In this study, we shall concentrate on the application and advantages of light-trees to unicast and broadcast traffic. We formulate the light-tree-based virtual topology design problem as an optimization problem with one of two possible objective functions: for a given traffic matrix, (i) minimize the network-wide average packet hop distance, or (ii) minimize the total number of transceivers in the network. We demonstrate that an optimum light-tree-based virtual topology has clear advantages over an optimum lightpath-based virtual topology with respect to the above two objectives.",

Issues related to access of the hardware test features in the system are discussed. Linking the built-in self-test to diagnostic software reduces software complexity while increasing diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, the use of structural test features in a routine diagnostic test permits subcritical faults to be detected and recorded in nonvolatile memory, thus facilitating failure analysis. It can then be seen that the superior test coverage, fault resolution, and flexibility that access to hardware test features gives, will be beneficial in improving overall system quality and reliability.",

Specific MPLS architectural features discussed are separation of control and forwarding, the label stack, multiple control planes, and integrated IP and constraint-based routing. The article then discusses how these features address network scalability, simplify network service integration, offer integrated recovery, and simplify network management. Scalability is addressed through integrated routing enabling a natural assignment of traffic to the appropriate traffic engineering tunnels without requiring special mechanisms for loop prevention. Change is greatly reduced. The label stack enables an effective means for local tunnel repair providing fast restoration. Feedback through the routing system permits fast and intelligent reaction to topology changes. Service integration is simplified through a unified QoS paradigm which makes it simple for services to request QoS and have it mapped through to traffic engineering.",

A paramount objective of Internet traffic engineering is to facilitate the transport of IP traffic through a given network in the most efficient, reliable, and expeditious manner possible. Historically, traffic engineering in the Internet has been hampered by the limited functional capabilities of conventional IP technologies. Recent developments in multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and differentiated services have opened up new possibilities to address some of the limitations of the conventional technologies.

We begin by outlining the role of test and its impact on product cost and quality. A brief look at the pending test crises for mixed-signal circuits is also considered. Subsequently, we outline the evolution of test strategies with time, and their corresponding test setups for verifying the function of the analog portion of a mixed-signal circuit. The article also describes several circuit techniques for improving test access and providing built-in self-test solutions for telecommunication circuits.",

      "abstract": "Medium access control protocols are at the core of all forms of electronic communications systems. MAC protocols are designed to coordinate the transmission of packets, retransmission of damaged packets, and resolution of collisions among stations during a contention period. MAC protocols are foundations in low-level network architecture and play a significant role in the performance of higher-level protocols such as multiservices and multimedia application protocols. In this article five classes of MAC protocols are investigated with respect to their applications in satellite communications. These classes include fixed assignments, demand assignment, random access, hybrid random access and reservation, and adaptive protocols. Among several QoS objectives described in high-speed networking and the limitations inherent in satellite communications systems, in this article a set of important performance criteria are identified and used to evaluate different MAC protocols for satellite communications. The performance criteria include high channel throughput, low transmission delay, channel stability, protocol scalability, channel reconfigurability, broadband applicability, and low complexity of the control algorithm. For this, a simulation study is performed among selected MAC protocols from different classes, and their performances have been evaluated for NASA's Mars Regional Network.",

Satellite networks also present unique challenges in system design related to quality of service (QoS) provisioning. In certain system scenarios, medium access control plays a crucial role in the network's ability to deliver a QoS contract. This article focuses on the applications that we envision will utilize future broadband satellite networks, and detail the various system environments which may exist as well as the means by which medium access control protocols can be used to provide QoS. We focus on one system scenario in particular and provide some simulation results on the performance of demand assigned multiple access techniques.",

      "abstract": "For p.I see ibid., vol.37, no.3, p.72-9 (1999). Traffic models for satellite network simulation must cover a broad range of traffic types and characteristics because the type of users/terminals that will access a satellite channel will range from a single home user (low traffic aggregation) to Internet backbone nodes (very high traffic aggregation). In addition, since satellite resources are generally considered more scarce than their fiber counterparts, the accuracy and practicality of traffic models play a crucial role. We address these challenges by identifying three traffic modeling areas for satellite network simulation, and propose an effective and flexible traffic model for each area: a discrete autoregressive process for MBone video source modeling; the superposition of fractal renewal processes (Sup-FRP) model for Web request arrivals; and a generalized shot-noise-driven Poisson point process (GSNDP) for aggregate traffic flows modeling. The efficacy of the first two models is demonstrated based on statistical analysis of various video and Web traces. These simulation-oriented models provide accurate descriptions of source traffic at various levels of traffic aggregation, and thus enable satellite network researchers and practitioners to understand key network design and engineering issues such as QoS provisioning based on simulation.",

      "abstract": "In previous years, the manner in which countries around the world regulate telecommunications services has undergone rapid change. In many countries, liberalization of telecommunications regulation has occurred, and formerly government-owned PTTs have been privatized. Competition and entry into telecommunications markets has been the goal of these policies with a focus on encouraging more investment and modernization of telecommunications infrastructures. New Zealand was one of the countries which in the late 1980s decided to liberalize its policies and privatize its PTT. Its unique approach to this process is examined, including its decision not to create a regulatory agency to oversee telecommunications markets and its reliance on competition policy to protect consumers.",

Momentum has gathered pace to the point where EC is considered at least an essential adjunct to a company's business or, in some cases, the primary means of connecting vendors to their customers. This momentum has been at least, partly inspired by the convergence of content, commerce, communication, and the Internet. In many EC systems, the state of the market (current value and availability of goods and services) or another event needs to be disseminated to consumers so that they can take actions based on the information. IP multicasting is an emerging network technology that can greatly improve the efficiency of providing such information.",

      "abstract": "A new generation of satellite networks is being developed to handle highly bursty Internet and multimedia traffic. In these networks, satellite links are used for interconnecting remote network segments as well as for providing direct network access to homes and businesses. In this environment, the satellite network must support not only circuit switched traffic, but also packet services with highly bursty traffic patterns. The traditional circuit switched approach based on the user or network signaling is inadequate to carry dynamically varying packet traffic efficiently, necessitating faster bandwidth allocation solutions. Standard interworking solutions and air interfaces are very important for interoperability leading to proliferation of satellite networks to potentially millions of home and business users. In this article we provide an overview of the standardization effort that has started at the TIA in the area of satellite ATM networks. Subsequently, a bandwidth-on-demand multiservice satellite network architecture implementation is described.",

In other words, the network engineer has to resolve the trade-off between capacity and QoS requirements. Accurate modeling of the offered traffic load is the first step in optimizing resource allocation algorithms such that provision of services complies with the QoS constraints while maintaining maximum capacity. As broadband multimedia services became popular, they necessitated new traffic models with self-similar characteristics. We present a survey of the self-similarity phenomenon observed in multimedia traffic and its implications on network performance. Our current research aims to fill the gap between this new traffic model and network engineering. An immediate consequence of this study is the demonstration of the limitations or validity of conventional resource allocation methods in the presence of self-similar traffic.",

Instructional television is a much newer phenomenon, but we nonetheless have decades of experience. However, currently we are experiencing a \"virtual land rush\" (some would say \"gold rush\") in distance education because of the advent of the Internet. This article examines why this is occurring, provide an overview of online distance education activities in the United States, and present a survey of the relevant technologies and their prospects.",

This article describes our adaptive Web server, OpenWebServer, which uses the Reflection architectural pattern. The server supports the dynamic adoption of functionality, such as introducing additional protocols, modifying execution policies, and tuning system performance. This is achieved by specifying and coordinating metaobjects that represent various aspects within the Web server. We present a Java version of OpenWebServer, and describe its design using Reflection and other design patterns: Singleton, Bridge, Mediator, Observer, and Decorator. These patterns provide a better-factored design and allow the Web server to evolve continually beyond static and monolithic servers.",

      "abstract": "Optical interconnections for communication networks and multiprocessor systems have been studied extensively. A basic element of optical switching networks is a directional coupler with two inputs and two outputs or switching elements (SEs). Depending on the control voltage applied to it, an input optical signal is coupled to either of the two outputs, setting the SE to either the straight or cross state. A class of topologies that can be used to construct optical networks is multistage interconnection networks, which interconnect their inputs and outputs via several stages of SEs. Although optical MINs hold great promise and have demonstrated advantages over their electronic counterparts, they also introduce new challenges such as how to deal with the unique problem of avoiding crosstalk in the SEs. In this article we survey the research carried out, including major challenges encountered and approaches taken, on optical MINs.",

      "abstract": "There has been a sense in the software engineering community that we are continually reinventing the wheel. This phenomenon can be clearly seen in any large company; where projects go their own way, solving problems that are similar or identical to problems being solved by other projects, sometimes down adjacent corridors in the same building. It is easy to point at a lack of communication and the classic \"not invented here\" syndrome, but the fact is, there hasn't been an appropriate communication medium for transferring knowledge. The widely applied code libraries did not even begin to tackle this problem. The notion of a pattern is based on the work of building architect Christopher Alexander (1978), who captured solutions to recurring problems. When expertise is captured and shared with others, it also brings improved communication through a well defined vocabulary of pattern names that reflect the successful solutions. There is a significant effort in the software community to apply this idea to problems and solutions in software development. Patterns provide a way to reuse expertise that can be used across domains at all levels of development.",

This article describes the practical experiences gained from TCP/IP on ATM networks over a high-speed satellite link and presents performance comparison studies of such networks with the same host/traffic configurations over local area and wide area networks. These comparison studies on the LAN, WAN, and satellite environments increase our understanding of the behavior of high-bandwidth networks. NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), with its special characteristics and high data rate satellite channels, and the ACTS ATM Internetwork (AAI) were used in these experiments to deliver broadband traffic. Network performance tests were carried out using application-level software (Netspec) on SONET OC-3 (155.52 Mb/s) satellite links. Finally, we experimentally study the performance, efficiency, fairness, and aggressiveness of TCP Reno, TCP New Reno, and TCP SACK end hosts on ATM networks over high BDP networks.",

      "abstract": "The latest developments and experimentation in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology show that ATM will be a candidate transport mechanism in many private and public multimedia networks. Furthermore, the interest in satellite ATM systems has grown considerably because they can rapidly and economically extend the boundaries of any terrestrial network. Currently, there is a huge increase in the demand for satellite communications operating at the Ka-frequency bands; several different systems have been proposed and are under development worldwide. Two main scenarios for satellite access network protocols are presented in this article. The first one uses ATM cell encapsulation and satellite-specific protocols for establishing and managing a connection, whereas the second one provides a highly integrated solution with the ATM protocol stack and defines a new satellite ATM (S-ATM) protocol layer.",

      "abstract": "Cable TV has emerged as a promising access network infrastructure for the delivery of voice, video, and high-speed data traffic. A central issue in the design of protocols for CATV networks is to support different levels of QoS for diverse user applications. While CATV service providers and equipment have standardized, in the so-called MCNS protocol, the basic network architecture and interfaces, issues in the MAC layer for QoS support are likely to be left for differentiation in vendor products. This article first presents an overview of the basic CATV network architectural assumptions and the set of QoS requirements for supporting integrated services over CATV. It then discusses a MAC layer scheduling protocol that can efficiently multiplex constant bit rate traffic, such as voice over IP with guaranteed delay bound, and best-effort traffic, such as data services with minimum bit rate guarantee, while achieving fairness on any excess available bandwidth. The performance of this algorithm is illustrated by simulation results using Opnet. We also discuss a dynamic polling mechanism that enhances the link utilization while preserving delay bounds for latency-critical traffic.",

An information superhighway system is envisioned to fulfill the plethora of demand for wireless communications and the need for multimedia networks with multiservice requirements. The revolution in this technology will eventually free us, as communication users, from being tied down to a particular fixed location in a telephone network to person-to-person communications, via pocket-sized terminals, at an affordable price. This article briefly surveys the state of the art, standards, and technological growth experienced in mobile cellular (terrestrial and satellite) communications since the days of the ingenious inventions of Alexander Graham Bell and Guglielmo Marconi, over a century ago. Subsequently, we describe some emerging technological trends that can improve the capacity of third-generation systems and future outlooks for PCS networks in the next millennium.",

G.Lite is a new form of DSL, and its characteristics are discussed. The article then presents a vision for the evolution of an analog modem-based service to G.Lite and ADSL services. The article explains the standardized architecture of PPP over ATM for DSL, and explores how the unique characteristics of G.Lite affect higher-layer protocols (PPP over ATM). Finally, it discusses a vision of how DSL will be deployed together with home networking to provide broadband services to multiple devices in a user-friendly fashion.",

The concepts are embedded in the framework of the HIPERLAN/2 system, which is currently under standardization by the ETSI Broadband Radio Access Networks (BRAN) project. HIPERLAN/2 aims at the provision of broadband services with guaranteed QoS. Originally started as a WATM standardization initiative, its scope has been broadened and now aims at core network independence. Essential system functions, such as scheduling algorithms and random access, are reviewed in light of the spatial dimension. To give an impression of their performance, some key results are discussed. Although adopted for HIPERLAN/2, the ideas are generally applicable and can be transferred to various systems.",

      "abstract": "The third-generation IMT-2000 initiative of the International Telecommunication Union is aiming at the provision of a limited family of global standards providing worldwide multimedia wireless services in a host of environments encompassing indoor picocells to satellite megacells. The ITU IMT-2000 initiative has been supported by several regional standardization bodies such as the European Telecommunication Standard Institute with its Universal Mobile Telecommunication System. In this article a few air interface proposals for the satellite component of UMTS/IMT-2000 based on adaptation of the emerging terrestrial wideband CDMA standards are reviewed. In particular, S-UMTS requirements are examined together with W-CDMA applicability to the satellite environment. It is shown that with minor adaptations, the terrestrial W-CDMA air interface provides an efficient solution for the satellite UMTS component. This commonality will certainly help in the realization of low-cost low-size dual-mode user terminals encompassing both terrestrial and satellite components.",

There are many avenues for improvement of the Web; for example, in the areas of locating and organizing information. Current techniques for access to both general and scientific information on the Web provide much room for improvement; search engines do not provide comprehensive indices of the Web and have difficulty in accurately ranking the relevance of results. Scientific information on the Web is very disorganized. We discuss the effectiveness of Web search engines, including results showing that the major Web search engines cover only a fraction of the \"publicly indexable Web\". Current research into improved searching of the Web is discussed, including new techniques for ranking the relevance of results, and new techniques in metasearch that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Web search. The creation of digital libraries incorporating autonomous citation indexing is discussed for improved access to scientific information on the Web.",

      "abstract": "Asymmetric digital subscriber loop technology is a new platform for delivering broadband services to homes and small businesses, thus bringing the information highway to the mass market. Successful deployment of an ADSL-based access network is not only a matter of delivering faster rates, but also offering solutions that are cost-effective and easy to use and manage. As deregulation and competition spread globally, an ADSL-based access network should also enable end users to choose their service providers dynamically, and to switch from one provider to another easily and rapidly, even on a real-time basis. In light of these requirements, this article addresses the issue of service provisioning in an ATM-over-ADSL access network. It concentrates on the provisioning of services using the PPP protocol. PPP is the common protocol for service provisioning in circuit-switched telephone networks. However, it is also considered a good choice for the delivery of broadband services since it has built-in mechanisms for IP address assignment, layer-2 security, and AAA (authentication, authorization and accounting). This article presents the problem of initiating a PPP connection at an Ethernet-based host. It presents several solutions for this problem and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each solution.",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in designing a wireless ATM network is to specify control functions capable of managing data and signaling connections of moving mobile terminals. The challenge is tough, due to the facts that such control functions neither exist in the current state-of-the-art wireless networks nor are included in the existing ATM specifications and implementations. This article describes the design principles of a wireless ATM signaling stack created in the WAND project. The article identifies some common problems and presents possible solutions to the problems. To justify the feasibility of the ideas presented, some details of a reference implementation, the Wireless ATM Network Demonstrator (WAND) signaling stack, are revealed.",

      "abstract": "Software radio has emerged as a priority theme of research in Europe. This tutorial review provides a European perspective on technical and commercial issues in the field. Significant differences exist between North American and European views of software radio in personal communications services. This article explains the reasons for these differences. It explains how the European marketplace is influencing short-term directions taken in the commercialization of software radio technology initially at the application layer. Some research is related to handset architectures and to generic RF and digital technologies focused on third-generation systems-Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems. Software base stations, including their synergies with adaptive (often now termed soft) antennas are also addressed.",

As the current switched network infrastructure is augmented by packet networks, the needs of voice users of these hybrid networks must be given due consideration. These users are accustomed to high-quality connections with low distortion in the speech signal and low transmission delay in the speech path. In order for packetized networks to gain widespread acceptance for speech transmission services, it is necessary to maintain this high-quality performance in the evolving networks. We discuss relevant speech transmission performance requirements and the associated activities taking place in regional and international standards bodies.",

      "abstract": "The high reliability exhibited by the Sprint long distance network is the result of many interrelated factors. The network utilizes robust architectures, systems, and equipment to provide a reliable transport infrastructure. Redundant equipment, conservative synchronization, protected power, and other factors combine to form a dependable foundation. New architectures and systems are under development to meet the changing demands of customers. This article summarizes Sprint's current network reliability, and emerging demands and technology, and presents possible directions for the future Sprint network. Sprint selected the SONET four-fiber bidirectional line switched ring (4F BLSR) architecture for the vast majority of its transport network architecture. A 4F BLSR architecture requires four fibers, or four optical wavelengths of wave division multiplexing (WDM), to accommodate a work and protect path in each direction around a ring of network elements or add-drop multiplexers (ADMs).",

Due to different deployment of these networks, different services were developed, such as voice mail in the telephone network and electronic mail on the Internet. With the revolution of multimedia in the computer industry, voice, video, and data are now being carried on both networks. Supplementary services, such as transfer and forwarding (which were originally developed for private telephone networks and later migrated to public telephone networks) are now being developed for packet networks. The standards for packet networks are being defined in the H.323-based series of ITU-T recommendations. This article provides the H.323 architecture for supplementary services, the differences in deployment of these services between the circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, and interworking of these services across hybrid networks.",

      "abstract": "A pan-European carriers' carrier network, like other carrier networks, must cope with the enormous traffic inflation by introducing appropriate network solutions. WDM technology is the solution adopted by GTS Carrier Services' Trans European Network unit (TEN, formerly known as Hermes Europe Railtel), driven by bandwidth requirements, infrastructure limitations, flexibility, and cost. The introduction of such new technology presents specific technical issues, although it lays the foundation of future optical networking. Network outages are an important concern since, by using WDM, tens of gigabits of data are transported on each fiber. On one hand, traffic interruption is avoided as much as possible through secure fiber routings, cable protection, high design and equipment standards, and security. On the other hand, network protection techniques are used to limit the impact on services when inevitable outages occur. We explain the role of the different technologies in TEN's network. We concentrate on WDM and optical networking where optical channels are used to interconnect the equipment used by the different technologies. We focus on optical network protection techniques and illustrate that a clear requirement exists for this. We also emphasize interworking issues that come into play when multiple technologies are combined in the same network. It is not the intent to discuss only future requirements, but also to explain how the different aspects are currently implemented in TEN's operational network.",

Accurate timing information must be known to the demodulator in order to produce reliable estimates of the transmitted data sequence. In this article, synchronization for discrete multitone transmission (DMT) is examined. The effect of imperfect timing on the receiver performance is investigated. An overview of timing estimation and correction circuits based on data-aided and non-data-aided algorithms derived from maximum-likelihood estimation theory is given.",

      "abstract": "With the emerging market for high-mobility remote access broadband services, satellite networks are becoming increasingly popular. Although the ubiquitous TCP/IP protocol is widely used to provide reliable data delivery in terrestrial networks, it faces many challenges in satellite environments. These stem from the inherent features of satellite channels, such as large delays, increased error rates, and bandwidth asymmetry. To address these concerns, a variety of solutions have been proposed. These include direct TCP enhancements to better tune the TCP/IP stack and additional selective acknowledgment mechanisms. Other proposals use advanced interworking to reduce sensitivity to various channel features. Examples include multiple TCP sessions, link-layer interworking, and ACK control schemes. Improving onboard satellite features (buffer management, flow control) can also provide benefits for TCP/IP transport. The objective of this article is to present the various solutions and discuss their possible trade-offs. Overall, there exists a rich set of alternatives to meet the challenges in this important arena.",

The issue is tackled from a practical perspective based on experiences gained through the design, realization, and experimentation of a system developed by the ACTS AC208 REFORM project. Assuming an ATM-based network infrastructure offering a range of services with distinct QoS guarantees, the REFORM system encompasses the required functions for ensuring cost-effective network survivability and availability; fast-responding reliable fault detection and self-healing mechanisms, distributed dynamic routing functions with inherent load balancing capabilities, efficient VP layer design, and dynamic network reconfiguration functions. A number of standards and emerging technologies were used for designing and realizing the wide spectrum of functionality incorporated within the REFORM system, including ITU-T OAM 1.610 and Q.2931, ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and PNNI v. 1, OMG CORBA and Component Model, TINA NRA and ISO/OSI, and ITU-T TMN. Based on the experience gained, the article discusses and draws conclusions on the applicability, coexistence, and interoperation of the adopted technologies. It is shown that these technologies can coexist, through careful design, to the benefit of network design and operation.",

However, significantly different solutions have been required in the past-dictated by factors including the complexity of the product under test and the extent to which features to support test could economically be designed into the product. The latter was a particular problem at the integrated circuit level where, for a long time, the amount of circuitry available within each component was limited. Today, what were once large and complex systems are now single integrated circuits. It has become both economical and technically desirable to deploy test approaches that were once relevant only to, say, mainframe computers to the testing of circuit boards, integrated circuits, and even parts of integrated circuits. Put simply, \"systems on silicon\" demand system-oriented test approaches. The goal of this article is to illustrate this point and to highlight the commonalities between what at first glance may appear to be different approaches to test applied at different levels of integration.",

      "abstract": "Extensive system testing is mandatory nowadays to achieve high product quality. Telecommunication systems are particularly sensitive to such a requirement; to maintain market competitiveness, manufacturers need to combine reduced costs, shorter life cycles, advanced technologies, and high quality. Moreover, strict reliability constraints usually impose very low fault latencies and a high degree of fault detection for both permanent and transient faults. This article analyzes major problems related to testing complex telecommunication systems, with particular emphasis on their memory modules, often so critical from the reliability point of view. In particular, advanced BIST-based solutions are analyzed, and two significant industrial case studies presented.",

      "abstract": "Market expectations for third-generation mobile radio systems (IMT-2000) show an increasing demand for a wide range of services from voice to low, high, and advanced data rate services to support mobile multimedia. This leads to technical requirements for IMT-2000 which are currently being standardized worldwide. Circuit- and packet-oriented services will be supported. These systems will operate in all radio environments to provide service to anyone, anytime, anywhere. The ITU has identified spectrum for the allocation of IMT-2000. However, these frequency bands are currently not available worldwide. In different regions research activities on IMT-2000 have been initiated to support the international consensus building process and standardization activities. Based on these activities system proposals have been submitted to ITU TG 8/1. In particular, the newly formed Third Generation Partnership Projects 3GPP and 3GPP2 have the objective of harmonizing similar proposals and defining detailed standards. Proposals from Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States are very similar. The evolution and migration of second-generation systems to the third generation takes into account the deployed investment to save today's investment where useful and necessary. This article focuses on market and technical requirements and, in particular, the technical approach of 3GPP based on the big footprint of the GSM system.",

Our experiment, which is one of the first two-way broadband fixed wireless systems offers an end-to-end broadband packet access service, with telecommuting as the primary application for our employee users. It operates in the 2.6 GHz MMDS spectrum, and is based on cable modem technology. We have developed a Web-based network monitoring/management tool that greatly enhances the ability to manage, diagnose, and optimize the system. The lengthy period of operation has allowed us to make observations about user behavior, weather-related channel impairments, and equipment performance. We have identified several design issues related to the application of cable modem technology to the fixed wireless environment. Also, we have measured a significant path loss effect arising from a combination of rain and foliage.",

During that time, the idea of ADSL has been modified and refined to fit market demand, many generations of ADSL chip set have been developed, and numerous trials have been conducted to prove its viability. In this article, the early development and standardization efforts of ADSL are reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of practical issues such as central office network interface and customer premises configuration options.

To establish end-to-end performance and availability standards, the ITU has developed recommendations for ATM intended to provide the quality of service and availability required by the end user. This article discusses the work of ITU-R Working Party 4B in developing recommendations that deal with the performance of ATM over satellites and with the availability objectives for ATM transport over satellites. Several issues are also identified for future work, in particular those pertaining to the characteristics of the new proposed satellites (LEOs, MEOs, GEOs) that will operate at frequencies higher than 15 GHz and those that plan to deploy ATM onboard processing or switching and intersatellite links.",

It does not simply compare new technologies and architectures, but accepts that most operators are not starting with a green-field site. It therefore also addresses the operator's problems of introducing and integrating new technologies into existing transport networks and migrating services from one transport technology to another. This in turn drives different technologies to evolve to new levels of reliability over time. The article is written from the perspective of an established European network operator, and differences are brought out from the evolution of networks in North America.",

This-coupled with the widespread deployment of dense wavelength-division multiplexed systems in the core transport network to satisfy the corresponding increase in capacity demand-has led network planners to reconsider traditional approaches to network survivability. Existing architectures for transport network survivability were developed based on a ubiquitous circuit-switched/TDM network paradigm. As tariffed services increasingly migrate from circuit-switched/TDM to packet-switched/DWDM networks, survivability architectures must also evolve to meet the service requirements of this \"new\" packet-switched/DWDM network paradigm. We begin with an overview of existing strategies for providing transport network survivability, followed by an analysis of how the architectures for network survivability may evolve to satisfy the requirements of emerging networks.",

This article discusses the principles of frequency planning in copper access networks that help to ensure compatibility of deployed systems.",

We consider the role signaling plays in such a network and argue in favor of pinned routes, with a highly efficient pinning process, to improve network stability and to ease the task of maintaining QoS guarantees in the face of changing network characteristics, including failures; the use of broad QoS classes to determine the path that a particular flow should follow through the network; and providing the flexibility of specifying the detailed QoS for the flow, if needed, at any arbitrary time during the life of the flow. We conclude that a flexible signaling architecture is an essential enabling component of any QoS-aware network. We present an overview of the design and implementation of UNITE, as an example of a signaling architecture that embodies these attributes. More generally, we consider the relationship between QoS-related signaling and other protocols and mechanisms that may form part of an overall QoS-enabled network and service infrastructure.",

The benefit of such interoperable services is the provision of \"one-stop shopping\" in which \"tailored\" services are delivered without their customers dealing with the multiplicity of underlying telecommunication services and network providers. The difficulty with such delivery chains is the complexity of managing these services across the different provider organizations (i.e., across both administrative and technological domains). These difficulties include achieving an understanding of business process across the organizations and the heterogeneity of the components to be (re)used to support these business processes in the organizations. This article examines three crucial elements in ensuring successful and flexible development of such service management systems-namely, a development process which is customized to support management system component development and component reuse; the development of business models capable of representing the underlying business processes for these systems; and an integration strategy designed to assist the flexible and timely cooperation of these management components both within a single organization (single administrative domain) as well as across organizations (multidomain).",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth of the Internet over the last few years has made the IP protocol suite the most predominant networking technology. Furthermore, the convergence of voice and data communications over a single network infrastructure is expected to happen over IP-based networks. Traditional IP-networks offer little predictability of service, which is often unacceptable for applications such as telephony, as well as for emerging and future real-time applications such as telemedicine. One of the primary goals of traffic engineering is to enable networks to offer predictable performance. Due to the need for better traffic control by network service providers, there has been considerable activity in the Internet Engineering Task Force to develop standards for traffic engineering in IP-based networks. This article discusses the direction taken by the IETF and some of the recent standardization efforts for traffic engineering using multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). Our primary focus is on the signaling protocols developed for this purpose.",

The ATM UBR, GFR, and ABR service categories have been designed for data. However, several studies have reported poor TCP performance over satellite ATM networks. We describe techniques to improve TCP performance over satellite ATM networks. We first discuss the various design options available for TCP end systems, IP-ATM edge devices, as well as ATM switches for long-latency connections. We discuss buffer management policies, guaranteed rate services, and the virtual source/virtual destination option in ATM. We present a comparison of ATM service categories for TCP transport over satellite links. The main goal of this article is to discuss design and performance issues for the transport of TCP over UBR, GFR, and ABR services for satellite ATM networks.",

      "abstract": "Custom local area signaling service features offered in the PSTN have certain limitations due to the closed nature of PSTN network signaling. The adoption of telephony over IP (IP telephony) will enable a new paradigm of services and features that are not possible to implement in today's PSTN. This is especially the case for services that make use of personal, trusted information, which can be provided by a user's personal digital assistant. We demonstrate how personal information can be coupled with an IP telephony service to provide user-customized call handling by the network. In particular, we describe a demonstration architecture that includes Ethernet-attached phones running SIP, with an interface to synchronize with PDAs that supply personal information. The proposed architecture is quite flexible; it can support enhanced versions of the current PSTN and private branch exchange services, in addition to many new features and services. We describe true number portability and advanced call screening as examples of new services in a hybrid PSTN/IP telephony environment.",

      "abstract": "The term next-generation Internet is increasingly common. Almost every system, application, protocol, and product has a next-generation version. There is a White House NGI Initiative, and nearly every major university networking community and institute in the world has some kind of \"next Internet\" project. There is no single future NGI manifestation. The Internet has grown far too complicated and diverse in its technologies, players, markets, and uses. Perhaps most important, the Internet itself has become a combination incentive and enabling mechanism for an almost incomprehensible number of autonomous development and entrepreneurial activities that constantly come into existence, and have global reach and effect. It has become its own self-sustaining means of reinvention. Ultimately, whatever emerges will be some kind of constantly evolving, grand recursive concatenation of all the myriad next-generation developments within developments.",

Security is an essential ingredient in enabling these electronic transactions. The fundamental requirements are to identify and authenticate the parties involved, and to protect the information from compromise. This article describes the elements of public-key infrastructures (PKIs), and show how they are well suited to provide these security services. The pioneering experience of Scotiabank, an early adopter of PKI technology and operator of one of the largest deployed PKIs on the Internet, is outlined.",

      "abstract": "This article presents an overview of the main technical problems to be addressed for the provision of interoperable services between IP telephony and the PSTN. The pivotal element of the solution resides in an interworking function. This function is typically implemented in a gateway whose requirements and behavior are here analyzed in terms of signaling and control protocols (control plane) as well as user data transfer (user plane). The presentation is structured around these two planes. The control plane defines the set of signaling protocols to be used in each networking context and the translation between them. Detailed scenarios illustrate the signal translation in the gateway allowing for the establishment of a hybrid phone call. The user plane is responsible for adapting the user data to the properties of each network channel and determines the quality of service of the voice call in terms of delay and speech quality.",

The project which is investigating a novel packet-based optical WDM transport network-involves determining the management, systems, and devices ramifications of a new network control scheme, SCWP, which is flexible and simplifies optical hardware requirements. The principal objective of the project is to understand the advantages and potential of optical packet switching compared to the conventional electronic approach. Several schemes for packet header implementation are described, using subcarrier multiplexing, separate wave lengths, and serial transmission. A novel node design is introduced, based on wavelength router devices, which reduce loss, hence reducing booster amplifier gain and concomitant ASE noise. The fabrication of these devices, and also wavelength converters, are described. A photonic packet switching testbed is detailed which will allow the ideas developed within WASPNET to be tested in practice, permitting the practical problems of their implementation to be determined.",

Discussions in the public arena are largely being led by wild enthusiasm for the far-reaching possibilities offered by this new technology and there appears to be no place for an objective review. Everything seems to be possible, with no limitations in sight. The Web and its applications are seen as the panacea for educational problems. This article is intended to draw attention to some of the limitations and pitfalls inherent in the application of teaching and learning methods based on use of the Web, at the same time taking a step back from the often emotional and poorly informed speculations in the mass media. The article shows actual trends in Web based educational research and tries to plot the location of the front-line as it stands today.",

According to this, a multimedia broadband application is considered as a set of hierarchically ordered adaptable media streams, which accept varying degrees of network-level guarantees, depending on dynamic resource changes and user preferences. Some algorithms that match the proposed paradigm are designed for call and mobility management. Their performance is analyzed in a mobile multitier cellular system, including the satellite component.",

      "abstract": "Almost a decade ago, Singapore started crafting and implementing its IT2000 master plan to transform the city-state into an information-technology-based intelligent island. Since 1997, the main infrastructure of a high-speed ATM-based backbone network, called SingaporeONE, has been in place along with a host of commercial and governmental application service sites providing a plethora of online services. Because of its small size and extensive wired infrastructure, broadband access to homes and offices is currently provided via ADSL and cable modems. There is, however, interest in the use of wireless broadband communication technologies to access SingaporeONE, motivated primarily by its lower cost and faster deployment. In this article we describe some of our R&amp;D activities motivated by the above interest to provide wireless broadband access to SingaporeONE. Specifically, we describe our study of LMDS, and the design and development of a wireless ATM LAN.",

      "abstract": "Due to increased pressure from alternatives, the pace of xDSL deployment must accelerate. This acceleration places increased emphasis on copper loop prequalification, which determines the suitability of a given loop for some class of xDSL service, and turn-up verification, which verifies that the customer is receiving the service tariffed or contracted. Although the physical characteristics and electrical impairments on copper loops are well understood, the variety of possible xDSL service types, both symmetrical and asymmetrical, current and anticipated, has complicated the deployment process. In the past, xDSL loop qualification and testing have been mostly ad hoc and labor-intensive activities. But a whole array of tools and test equipment have come along to make xDSL prequalification and turn-up verification less of an adventure and more of a key aspect of a for-profit business venture. Initial techniques can still be time-consuming and the new equipment expensive, but the new methods hold a lot of promise for the future of xDSL loop qualification and testing.",
