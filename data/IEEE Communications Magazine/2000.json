   "abstract": "Local access encompasses requirements of high throughput, transfer performance, flexibility, and ease of user/terminal mobility at a relatively low cost. While some of these targets can often be met satisfactorily with wired infrastructures, it is getting increasingly popular to resort to wireless access (wireless LAN), mainly because of its simpler deployment, continuous coverage, availability of ad hoc connectivity, and user/terminal mobility support. This article outlines the proposal of a broadband quality-oriented WLAN system. The basic system characteristics are described, with details given on a MAC protocol supporting IP and exploiting an OFDM-CDMA technique.",

   "abstract": "A packet-switched system architecture based on the combination of a single-chip output-buffered switch element and input queues that sort arriving packets on a per-output-port basis is proposed. Scheduling is performed in a distributed two-stage approach. Independent arbiters at each of the inputs resolve input contention. Whereas the output-buffered switch element resolves output contention. As a result of this distribution of functionality, complexity of the input arbiters is only linearly proportional to the number of output ports N, thus offering better scalability than purely input-buffered approaches that require complex centralized schedulers. Since the input queues are used as the main buffering mechanism, only a relatively small amount of memory (on the order of N/sup 2/ packet locations) is required in the shared-memory switch, allowing high-throughput implementations. We present simulation results to demonstrate the high performance and robustness under bursty traffic achieved with the proposed system architecture. A practical implementation in the form of the PRIZMA family of switch chips is outlined, with emphasis on its versatility in scaling in terms of both port speed and number of ports, and its support for quality-of-service mechanisms.",

   "abstract": "This article addresses the issues of scalable end-to-end QoS in metropolitan DWDM networks serving as transit networks for IP access networks. DWDM offering a few wavelengths has been deployed in the past in backbone networks to upgrade point-to-point transmission where sharing is based on coarse granularity. This type of DWDM backbone network, offering a few light-paths, provides no support for QoS services traversing the network. As DWDM networks with larger numbers of wavelengths penetrate the data-centric metro environment, specific IP service requirements such as priority restoration, scalability, dynamic provisioning of capacity and routes, and support for coarse-grain QoS capabilities will have to be addressed in the optical domain in order to achieve end-to-end QoS over a DWDM network. We propose a QoS service model in the optical domain called differentiated optical services (DoS) based on a set of optical parameters that captures the quality and reliability of the optical lightpath.",

   "abstract": "High spectral efficiency and flexible data rate access are the main focus of future wireless networks. Multiple channel allocation schemes have the potential of achieving this goal. By assigning multiple slots and/or multiple carriers to one user, it is possible to provide a flexible data rate with quite low complexity. In this article we propose a simple allocation scheme where each user is assigned a fixed group of carriers. These carriers are adaptively used depending on the interference situation within the system. The system performance in terms of average throughput is investigated for two different types of allocation schemes: a fully centralized scheme and a distributed one that uses frequency diversity as a mean of improving the user link quality. The obtained results show that both schemes improve the system throughput over single carrier allocation without affecting the capacity of the system in terms of number of users per cell.",

   "abstract": "We describe an optical regional access network which combines electronic IP routing with intelligent networking functionality of the optical WDM layer. The optical WDM layer provides such networking functions as network logical topology reconfiguration, optical flow switching to offload traffic and bypass IP routers, wavelength routing of signals, protection switching and restoration in the optical domain, and flexible network service provisioning by reconfigurable wavelength connectivity. We discuss key enabling technologies for the WDM layer and describe their limitations. The symbiosis of electronic and optical WDM networking functions also allows support for heterogeneous format traffic and will enable efficient gigabit-per-second user access in next-generation Internet networks.",

   "abstract": "The Internet is evolving from an infrastructure that provides basic communication services into a more sophisticated infrastructure that supports a wide range of electronic services such as virtual reality games and rich multimedia retrieval services. However, this evolution is happening only slowly, in part because the communication infrastructure is too rigid. In this article we present a programmable router architecture in which the control plane functionality of the router can be extended dynamically through the use of delegates. Delegates can control the behavior of the router through a well-defined control interface, allowing service providers and third-party software vendors to implement customized traffic control policies or protocols. We describe Darwin, a system that implements such an architecture. We emphasize the runtime environment the system provides for delegate execution and the programming interface the system exports to support delegates. We demonstrate the advantages of using this system with two delegate examples.",

   "abstract": "The rapid growth of computer networks has made the process of understanding the interaction among network components more challenging than ever. The increase in the size of networks is accompanied by the more demanding use of networks by distributed applications that critically rely on the system to function well. Consequently, monitoring the health and stability of networks has become crucial. Tools and probes to measure the performance of networks for the purpose of management, fault diagnosis, or performance evaluation have been developed by several research groups. There is not yet, however, a measurement infrastructure which offers systematic control and management of measurement efforts and performance data focused on supporting distributed network-aware applications. This work addresses the implementation of a scalable and extensible network measurement infrastructure used to capture network state to improve the performance of a distributed application.",

This article presents a unified architecture for the design of soft radios on a reconfigurable platform called the layered radio architecture. The layered architecture makes it possible to incorporate all of the features of a software radio while minimizing complexity issues. The layered architecture also enables a methodology for incorporating changes and updates into the system. An example implementation of the layered architecture on actual hardware is presented.",

   "abstract": "Second-generation mobile radio systems have been deployed successfully worldwide. These systems have evolved to higher data rates and packet transmission. Third-generation mobile radio systems are currently being standardized worldwide to be initially deployed in 2001 and 2002 in different regions of the world. New advanced multimedia services are under development, and first services are already being offered in second-generation systems, which will provide new business opportunities. Already today discussion is starting on the development of systems beyond third-generation mobile radio systems due to the long timeframe for system specification and international standardization. However, today there is no clear vision available on such systems. This discussion takes into account the new deregulated and liberalized communication environment. This article presents a concept for a system beyond third-generation mobile radio systems, which comprises a combination of several optimized access systems in a common IP-based medium access and core network platform. These different access systems will interwork through horizontal and vertical handover, service negotiation, and global roaming. The different access systems are allocated to different mutually complementing cell layers in the sense of hierarchical cells with respect to cell size, coverage, and mobility to provide globally optimized seamless services to users. This vision requires extensive international research and standardization activities to solve many technical challenges. Key issues are the global interworking of different access systems on a common platform, advanced antenna concepts, and the implementation of multimode and multiband terminals and base stations through software-defined radio concepts.",

This motivates us to introduce a new management architecture, named active distributed management, which exploits the active network and mobile agent paradigms and provides the properties of distributed control and programmability inside the network. We realize the ADM architecture as a management middleware composed of several layers. In order to facilitate the development of efficient and correct programs, these layers include patterns for distributed algorithms that are typical for management applications and a set of building blocks for constructing management programs. First results of an ADM prototype system are presented.",

   "abstract": "The emerging next generation of routers exhibit both high performance and rich functionality, such as support for virtual private networks and QoS. To achieve this, per-flow queuing and fast IP filtering are incorporated into the router hardware. The management of a network comprising such devices and efficient use of the new functionality introduce new challenges. A truly distributed network management system is an attractive candidate to address these challenges. We describe how active network techniques can be used to allow fast and easy deployment of distributed network management applications in IP networks. We describe a prototype system where legacy routers are enhanced with an adjunct active engine, which enables the safe execution and rapid deployment of new distributed management applications in the network layer. This system can gradually be integrated in today's IP network, and allows smooth migration from IP to programmable networks. This is done with an emphasis on efficient use of network resources, which is somewhat obscure by many of today's high-level solutions.",

   "abstract": "Ad hoc networks are wireless multihop networks whose highly volatile topology makes the design and operation of a standard routing protocol hard. With an active networking approach, one can define and deploy routing logic at runtime in order to adapt to special circumstances and requirements. We have implemented several active ad hoc routing protocols that configure the forwarding behavior of mobile nodes, allowing data packets to be efficiently routed between any two nodes of the wireless network. Isolating a simple forwarding layer in terms of both implementation and performance enables us to stream delay-sensitive audio data over the ad hoc network. In the control plane, active packets permanently monitor the connectivity and setup, and modify the routing state.",

   "abstract": "Today's cellular systems are designed to achieve 90-95 percent coverage for voice users (i.e., the ratio of signal to interference plus noise must be above a design target over 90 to 95 percent of the cell area). This ensures that the desired data rate which achieves good voice quality can be provided \"everywhere\". As a result, SINRs that are much larger than the target are achieved over a large portion of the cellular coverage area. For a packet data service, the larger SINR can be used to provide higher data rates by reducing coding or spreading and/or increasing the constellation density. It is straight-forward to see that cellular spectral efficiency (in terms of b/s/Hz/sector) can be increased by a factor of two or more if users with better links are served at higher data rates. Procedures that exploit this are already in place for all the major cellular standards in the world. In this article, we describe data rate adaptation procedures for CDMA (IS-95), wideband CDMA (cdma2000 and UMTS WCDMA), TDMA (IS-136), and GSM (GPRS and EDGE).",

Wavelength conversion at key network nodes is emerging as a fundamental functionality that can allow transparent interoperability, contention resolution, wavelength routing, and, in general, better utilization of the network resources under dynamic traffic patterns. We offer an overview of the enabling technologies and extend the treatment to the network application of these converters. Attention is given to semiconductor optical amplifiers and their use in wavelength converters. Converters based on four-wave mixing as well as those based on nonlinear optical loop mirrors are evaluated, paying special attention to signal integrity and architectural as well as performance issues. The use of wavelength converters in wavelength routing networks is explored together with the application of these devices in contention resolution and in the routing wavelength assignment problem. Future directions are outlined at the system as well as network levels.",

WDM technology is the solution adopted by GTS, driven by capacity requirements, infrastructure availability, flexibility, and cost. The deployment of this new technology presents specific technical issues, but more important, it lays the foundation of future optical networking. We describe the motives underlying the deployment of WDM technology in the long-haul and short-haul areas of GTS's operational transport network. Next, after presenting the use of WDM as the multiservice platform for SDH and IP overlay networks as well as native WDM services, we focus on the design of SDH-over-WDM and IP-over-WDM networks. Finally, we discuss future WDM networking and management requirements to better serve the needs of a pan-European carrier such as GTS.",

   "abstract": "The article describes the application of the integrated services concept where IP is using ATM as the transport layer for providing QoS control. Integrated services technologies based on IPv6 have been developed and implemented in a pan-European field trial where students are evaluating distance learning applications with QoS control. An overview of the architecture is given, followed by a description of the features of the basic technologies. The background for selecting the technologies is described. The focus is on the access network domain, and the objective is to reduce the resources required and be able to offer a range of premium services. The work of extending user applications for distance learning with QoS is described. The technical performance and user perception of QoS control were tested and evaluated in the trials. The main conclusions and recommendations are discussed. The integrated services concept is recommended for use in the access network. It was found that QoS control of end-user applications is of benefit for distance learning. However, the design of the user interface should hide all network-relevant parameters from the end user. There is a need for standard software to support integrated services.",

   "abstract": "STREAMS kernel mechanisms are being used to implement networking protocols in a number of operating systems, like UNIX, Windows, and pSOS. STREAMS provides a number of desirable features for modular protocol stack implementation by defining a high degree of standardization for implementing protocol layer modules and for message transfer between the modules. But this strict layered and modular approach prevents flexibility in implementing techniques that can result in high performance. The original STREAMS-based stacks have shown very poor protocol performance. A number of improved techniques for implementing STREAMS-based protocol stacks have been suggested in the literature in the past few years. These techniques have resulted in high-performance STREAMS-based stacks that match the performance of BSD UNIX-based stacks. This article makes a study of these new approaches and discusses the performance gains achieved by them. These approaches can be used for implementing high-performance protocol stacks in the STREAMS kernel, over both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems.",

   "abstract": "Wavelength-division multiplexing is currently being deployed in telecommunications networks in order to satisfy the increased demand for capacity brought about by the explosion in Internet use. The most widely accepted network evolution prediction is via an extension of these initial predominantly point-to-point deployments, with limited system functionalities, into highly interconnected networks supporting circuit-switched paths. While current applications of WDM focus on relatively static usage of individual wavelength channels, optical switching technologies enable fast dynamic allocation of WDM channels. The challenge involves combining the advantages of these relatively coarse-grained WDM techniques with emerging optical switching capabilities to yield a high-throughput optical platform directly underpinning next-generation networks. One alternative longer-term strategy for network evolution employs optical packet switching, providing greater flexibility, functionality, and granularity. This article reviews progress on the definition of optical packet switching and routing networks capable of providing end-to-end optical paths and/or connectionless transport. To date the approaches proposed predominantly use fixed-duration optical packets with lower-bit-rate headers to facilitate processing at the network-node interfaces. Thus, the major advances toward the goal of developing an extensive optical packet-switched layer employing fixed-length packets are summarized, but initial concepts on the support of variable-length IP-like optical packets are also introduced. Particular strategies implementing the crucial optical buffering function at the switching nodes are described, motivated by the network functionalities required within the optical packet layer.",

   "abstract": "The current processes by which telecommunications standards are adopted are flawed. Certain companies are able to exploit these flaws to extract hundreds of millions of dollars in patent royalties from the telecommunications industry. In particular, companies can: (1) word their patent statements to appear to comply with the bylaws of an organization while not actually doing so; (2) interpret their statements to provide a basis to refuse to offer licenses to certain parties; and (3) hide their intellectual property until after a standard has been adopted and has gained widespread acceptance. Exposure of these strategies may enable contributors to better analyze the patent statements of standard committee members and generate improved organization bylaws.",

   "abstract": "The rapid growth of wireless voice subscribers, the growth of the Internet, and the increasing use of portable computing devices suggest that wireless Internet access will rise rapidly over the next few years. Rapid progress in digital and RF technology is making possible highly compact and integrated terminal devices, and the introduction of sophisticated wireless data software is making wireless Internet access more user-friendly and providing more value. Transmission rates are currently only about 10 kb/s for large cell systems. Third-generation wireless access such as WCDMA and the evolution of second-generation systems such as TDMA IS-136+, EDGE, and CDMA IS-95 will provide nominal bit rates of 50-384 kb/s in macrocellular systems. This article discusses packet data transmission rates of 2-5 Mb/s in macrocellular environments and up to 10 Mb/s in microcellular and indoor environments as a complementary service to evolving second- and third-generation wireless systems. Dynamic packet assignment for high-efficiency resource management and packet admission; OFDM at the physical layer with interference suppression, space-time coding, and frequency diversity; as well as smart antennas to obtain good power and spectral efficiency are discussed in this proposal. Flexible allocation of both large and small resources also permits provisioning of services for different delay and throughput requirements.",

Instead we try to show how these protocols can work together. We divide an end-to-end network into core networks and edge networks. We then consider two options for core networks: ATM-based and IP/MPLS-based. For each core/edge architecture, we further consider various access architectures for residential users. We show how these access architectures can be integrated with the two core architectures. Based on the specific requirements of core and edge networks, we discuss the benefits and problems of each solution.",

Rather than writing these applications from the ground up, it would be helpful to have a relatively high-level API on which to prototype new applications. In this article we describe a set of Java packages developed at Cornell University to accomplish this purpose. The software's name is ITX; it is available for download at no charge, and includes sample applications and documentation.",

   "abstract": "This article describes the main challenges of implementing an end-to-end architecture for delivery of high-quality, IP-based residential TV services to residential customers. The IP-based approach can be implemented with an IP multicast overlay network with traditional routers or use IP-multicast-aware ATM switching systems. Both approaches use IP multicast to transport MPEG-2 broadcast video and can work on any access architecture, especially on copper-based architectures (xDSL) such as ASDL and VDSL. The main challenges met while implementing the IP-based architecture are competitive positioning relative to traditional CATV architectures, overall architecture, head-end architecture and quality issues, traffic engineering for stringent QoS requirements, IP multicast requirements, and business case considerations. The IP-based approach described leverages Internet technology advancements and capitalizes on the impacts of Internet on interactive entertainment. Video channel manipulation at the head-end is dependent on access bandwidth and affects video quality. Video traffic management to meet stringent QoS requirements is challenging at the IP layer.

This has been fuelled by a large demand on high-frequency utilization as well as a large number of users requiring simultaneous high-data-rate access for the applications of wireless mobile Internet and e-commerce. The convergence of wireless mobile and access will be the next storm in wireless communications, which will use a new network architecture to deliver broadband services in a more generic configuration to wireless customers, and support value-added services and emerging interactive multimedia communications. Large bandwidth, guaranteed quality of service, and ease of deployment coupled with the great advancements in semiconductor technologies make this converged wireless system a very attractive solution for broadband service delivery.",

Multiple codes are used to recover from gaps on the wireless link after a fading period by means of ARQ-type retransmissions. One key feature of our work is that even a small number of multiple codes leads to a dramatic reduction of losses regarding delay bounds of multimedia applications.",

   "abstract": "This article presents the design and development of a networking system architecture targeted to support high-speed TCP/IP communication over ATM. The discussed architecture has been developed in the form of an integrated system which incorporates state-of-the-art software and hardware subsystems, and an OC-12c ATM adapter (622 Mb/s). Moreover, the design of this embedded system has been based on the Chorus real-time operating system, which, in turn, hosts an accelerated TCP/IP protocol stack over ATM. Furthermore, the embedded system board has been developed according to the PCI specification to easily be plugged into a host platform. In addition, the OC-12c ATM adapter subsystem has been designed and developed in order to also be plugged into the same host. The developed architecture has proven very efficient and reliable, providing high-throughput and low-latency bulk data communications. The measured performance on an OC-3c-based (155 Mb/s) testbed has shown that an optimally implemented TCP/IP stack, hosted by a real-time kernel and coupled with an ATM adapter, offers a robust desktop platform for high-speed end-to-end communications. The main feature of the accelerated TCP/IP protocol stack is the out-of-band processing of control and data information. The protocol accelerator embedded system processes the TCP/IP headers and accomplishes checksum computations, while data is transferred from the host's user memory space directly to the network. Finally, for validation purposes, the prototype system has been incorporated in an existing networking infrastructure targeted to support mass storage applications.",

   "abstract": "This article discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with a fundamental transformation of current networks toward a multiservice ubiquitous infrastructure with a unified control and management architecture. After articulating the major driving forces for network evolution, we outline the fundamental reasons why neither the control infrastructure of the PSTN nor that of the present-day Internet is adequate to support the myriad of new services in next-generation networks. Although NGN will inherit heavily from both the Internet and the PSTN, its control and management architecture is likely to be radically different from both, and will be anchored on a clean separation between a QoS-enabled transport/network domain and an object-oriented service/application domain, with a distributed processing environment that glues things together and universally addresses issues of distribution, redundancy, and concurrency control for all applications. Finally, we allude to the transition issues and show how voice-over-packet services are emerging as the bootstrap application for marshaling in the NGN architecture.",

   "abstract": "This article introduces the key concepts, organization, and operations of distributed sample-based acquisition (DSA) systems, which have previously been introduced for fast and robust synchronization of the long-period scrambling codes in DS/CDMA environments. In DSA systems, the transmitter samples and sends the state of its main sequence generator, or main shift register generator (SRG), in a distributed manner over the short-period igniter sequence, and the receiver detects and applies the state samples to correct the state of its main SRG, thereby acquiring SRG synchronization after a round of state reception. Acquisition performance of DSA techniques is extremely fast and robust compared to typical correlation-based acquisition techniques of comparable complexity. This article discusses the operation and performance of DSA techniques in the DS/CDMA communication environment as well as their applications to intercell synchronous and asynchronous cellular systems.",

   "abstract": "E-commerce has become a huge business and a driving factor in the development of the Internet. Online shopping services are well established and will, with the advent of evolved 2G and 3G mobile networks, soon be complemented by their wireless counterparts. Furthermore, online delivery of digital media, such as MP3 audio or video, is very popular today and will become an increasingly important part of e-commerce and mobile e-commerce (m-commerce). However, a major obstacle for digital media distribution and associated business is the possibility of unlimited consecutive copying in the digital domain, which threatens intellectual property rights (e.g., copyrights). Digital rights management systems are required to protect rights and business. DRM systems typically incorporate encryption, conditional access, copy control mechanisms, and media identification and tracing mechanisms. Watermarking is the technology used for copy control and media identification and tracing. Most proposed watermarking methods use a so-called spread spectrum approach: a pseudo-noise signal with small amplitude is added to the host signal, and later on detected using correlation methods. A secret key is used to ensure that the watermark can only be detected and removed by authorized parties. Thus, watermarking is an essential component of modern DRM systems. Several standardization bodies are involved in DRM standardization. Some examples, (MPEG-4, SDMI, and DVD), are discussed in this article. Watermarking as an enabling technology is especially highlighted. Furthermore, the relation between DRM and m-commerce, and the impact on business models for m-commerce are discussed. A common experience today is that Internet e-commerce applications cannot always easily be adapted for mobile telecommunications systems. We emphasize, however, that DRM and watermarking can benefit from the additional information available in mobile telecommunications systems, and can thus help to improve rights management for digital media delivery.",

   "abstract": "Earlier efforts on optical access concentrated on the design of PONs for the collection and distribution portion of the access network. A possible evolution scenario for these types of access networks could be the SuperPON system. The SuperPON system exploits all possible upgrades of an FSAN APON system. In these networks the optical hardware is very simple, but a media access control protocol is needed for upstream traffic control. Even so, the role of communications is already well established in the office environment, thanks to networking innovations such as the Ethernet LAN. With the development of cheap, affordable broadband communications and the increasing complexity of consumer goods, it seems natural to extend the network into homes. As home area network application ever increases, we consider connectivity between the access network and the home network, which generates multiple traffic, in order to design a MAC protocol over the SuperPON access network with home networks. Global FIFO is quite simple, and allows dynamic upstream bandwidth allocation on the basis of a request-and-permit mechanism on the APON architecture. It has good bandwidth efficiency; however, being cell-based, it does not consider multiple traffic types from home networks. In this article we describe and analyze a new dynamic MAC resource allocation algorithm called multiple queue-FIFO that can achieve good performance under the SuperPON access network in the home network environment.",

   "abstract": "W-CDMA is the strongest candidate for the air interface technology of third-generation wireless communication systems. Dynamic resource scheduling is proposed as a framework that will provide QoS provisioning for multimedia traffic in W-CDMA systems. The DRS framework monitors the traffic variations and adjusts the transmission powers of users in an optimal manner to accommodate different service classes efficiently. Variable and optimal power allocation is suggested to provision error requirements and maximize capacity, while prioritized queuing is introduced to provision delay bounds. A family of DRS algorithms has been devised along these dimensions for obtaining different levels of QoS. The DRS schemes are discussed in terms of queuing and bandwidth allocation with an emphasis on their impact on delay QoS.",

   "abstract": "The rules with respect to the patentability of software and business method inventions have loosened over the last decade to allow a broader range of patentability. Many patents issuing today are in the e-commerce area, and there is often a close relationship between what is being patented and generation of wealth. Critics of the surge of e-commerce patents argue these patents may stifle development of e-commerce. The level of concern of critics may be unwarranted since the broader range of patentability that has occurred has been balanced somewhat against a narrower scope of protection occurring during the same time period as a result of more restrictive claim interpretation during enforcement of patents. This more restrictive claim interpretation has created an onus on patent owners to effectively draft and prosecute patents to obtain protection commensurate with the scope of the inventions.",

   "abstract": "Traffic measurements are becoming increasingly complex due to the variety of traffic types and the integration of different network media. Although traditional tools such as sniffers and network probes are still useful for traffic measurement, they often limit their scope to network packet analysis and visualization. This means that human operators need to manually perform specific actions when some anomalous traffic conditions happen since they have very limited, if any, support from the above tools. This article covers the design and implementation of ntop, an open-source Web-based traffic measurement and monitoring application. It enables users to track relevant network activities including traffic characterization, network utilization, network protocol usage, and congestion detection. Ntop's extensibility through dynamically loadable software components opens it to extensions by network administrators. In addition, its native security flaw detection facilities allow ntop to detect potentially dangerous traffic conditions, and hence to dynamically and autonomously adapt network configuration to tackle the identified problems.",

This work explores the efficiency of IP telephony in terms of the volume of voice traffic carried with deterministically guaranteed quality related to the amount of network resources used. An IP network carrying compressed voice is compared to circuit switching carrying PCM (64 kb/s) encoded voice, and some design choices affecting IP telephony efficiency are discussed.",

   "abstract": "An efficient call admission control scheme for handling heterogeneous services in wireless ATM networks is proposed. Quality-of-service provisioning of jitter bounds for constant bit rate traffic and delay bounds for variable bit rate traffic is used in the CAC scheme to guarantee predefined QoS levels for all traffic classes. To reduce the forced handoff call dropping rate, the CAC scheme gives handoff calls a higher priority than new calls by reserving an appropriate amount of resources for potential handoff calls. Resource reservation in the CAC scheme makes use of user mobility information to ensure efficient resource utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed CAC scheme can achieve both low handoff call dropping rate and high resource utilization.",

Surprisingly, it has only been in the past three years that attempts to combine DRAM with meaningful amounts of Boolean logic, on the same substrate, have occurred. Although much fanfare has accompanied this technological breakthrough, commonly referred to as embedded DRAM, few system designers appreciate the complexity of this new technology, let alone its applicability to other circuit forms. This article provides background information about embedded DRAM technology, provide suggestions on how structural and electrical elements of the embedded DRAM era might be reused in other circuits, and review circuit theory that is directly attributed to the DRAM technology progression.",

   "abstract": "The increasing integration of telecommunications networks creates possibilities for interoperability among their respective management systems, using common management interfaces for CMIP, SNMP, CORBA, and Java RMI. Many Java technologies related to network management have been developed; therefore, it is desirable to create a development environment using Java technologies. We explore a TMN-based management platform model and the applicable Java technologies. We demonstrate that the management platform can support certain candidate management interfaces as service components in a distributed computing environment. Lastly, we show that using Java technologies to provide network management indicates the feasibility of this management platform.",

   "abstract": "Faced with fierce competition from cable operators, telephone companies are now aggressively investing in digital subscriber line technology with the objective of providing an economic broadband access alternative. However, high-bit-rate transmissions over the metallic access network is far from trivial. The subscriber loop predominantly consists of interconnection of twisted pair copper sections. This causes severe attenuation of the high-frequency components of the transmitted signal. Equalization refers to the signal processing in the transceiver to combat the effects of the dispersive channel on the transmitted signal. This article overviews equalization methods for discrete multitone modulation (DMT). The interference structure created by a non-ideally equalized channel is analyzed. Time modulation as well as frequency domain equalization methods are addressed.",

As this technology swap comes to an end, WDM technology is dawning, promising to revolutionize the network industry, with the possibility of transport bit rates above 10 Gb/s as well as transparency to signal encodings. However, a new wave of equipment upgrade is unlikely to happen as current SONET equipment is just beginning to pay off for its large investment. Thus, in years to come, SONET technology, the current standard for optical fiber access, will have to make room for WDM technology in a gradual way. On its part, WDM equipment must be developed to be backward compatible with SONET technology. This article discusses the requirements and issues involved in making WDM technology interoperable with SONET legacy equipment, as well as the evolution path toward a transparent optical transport network.",

In this article we discuss three of these initiatives: PINT, Parlay, and IN/CORBA interworking. The IETF PINT work addresses how Internet applications can request and enrich telecommunications services. The Parlay consortium is specifying an object-oriented service control API that facilitates the access, control, and configuration of IN services by enterprise IT systems. The OMG's IN/CORBA interworking specification enables CORBA-based systems to interwork with existing IN infrastructure, thereby promoting the adoption of CORBA for the realization of IN functional entities. We address how all three of these technologies could be deployed together in order to provide a basis for a more flexible and open IN architecture. We also identify a number of common trends and potential pitfalls highlighted by current work on the evolution of IN.",

   "abstract": "Multiple access techniques which allow a communication medium to be shared between different users represent one of the most challenging topics in digital communications. In terms of the number of users that can be accommodated on a given channel, there are two distinct classes of multiple access techniques. The first class includes the well-known FDMA, TDMA, and OCDMA. On a channel whose bandwidth is N times the bandwidth of the individual user signals, these techniques can accommodate N users without any mutual interference, but not a single additional user can be supported beyond this limiting number. The second class includes CDMA with pseudo-noise spreading sequences (which we refer to as PN-CDMA) and some other related schemes. PN-CDMA does not have a hard limit on the number of users that can be accommodated, but is subject to multi-user interference which grows linearly with the number of users. In this article, after reviewing the capacity limits of existing multiple access techniques, we describe some newly introduced concepts which allow us to accommodate N users without any interference while also accommodating additional users at the expense of some SNR penalty.",

The combination of filtering, small amounts of excess bandwidth, multicarrier channel partitioning, and some equalization are shown to allow a good match for spectrum management and performance challenges in VDSL transmission. The FMT basic functions are overviewed in the context of filter banks, with appropriate changes for nonzero excess bandwidth.",

   "abstract": "Competition in the telecommunications market is growing rapidly. Therefore, network operators and service providers have to reform their marketing and service delivery strategies in order to be competitive in the broadband service market. A convergence strategy for fixed and mobile services via a standards-based IN platform may provide a step in the right direction. This article deals with evolutionary steps for convergence services and their benefits to network operators and customers. It presents possible migration paths from the existing GSM to UMTS. The article also provides a comparative analysis of the wireless technologies involved in this evolution.",

   "abstract": "The International Telecommunication Union launched the third-generation project in 1986 with the aim to provide global personal communication using an inexpensive mobile terminal that can truly facilitate communication \"anywhere, anytime\". In previous years, standardization activities toward IMT-2000 have accelerated toward concrete specifications. By June 1998, a total of 15 proposals from around the world had been submitted to the ITU as radio transmission technology candidates. Since then, the 3G standardization landscape has seen many changes-a steady progression of the convergence process. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the worldwide harmonization efforts on the standardization of third-generation terrestrial mobile communication systems. The status, as of October 1999 when this article was written, of the technical specifications within 3G partnership projects are also summarized.",

   "abstract": "The Internet transport infrastructure is moving toward a model of high-speed routers interconnected by intelligent optical core networks. A consensus is emerging in the industry on utilizing an IP-centric control plane within optical networks to support dynamic provisioning and restoration of lightpaths. At the same time, there are divergent views on how IP routers must interact with optical core networks to achieve end-to-end connectivity. This article describes the architectural alternatives for interconnecting IP routers over optical networks, considering the routing and signaling issues. Also, the application of IP-based protocols for dynamic provisioning and restoration of lightpaths, as well as the interworking of multivendor optical networks is described.",

   "abstract": "This article reports on design, implementation, and preliminary experimentation of a network architecture that supports quality of service for Internet applications. It gives an overview of the various approaches toward communication networks that support application-specific degrees of QoS. Special emphasis is put on the integrated and differentiated services approaches and on combinations of them. A new architecture is described which aims to bring these concepts closer to practical realization in wide-area networks. The new architecture supports the integrated as well as differentiated services approaches in a smoothly integrated way, and uses the capabilities of an underlying ATM network to realize QoS. The enhancements to the existing network infrastructure are deliberately limited to the integration of a single new type of network element called an edge device. The potential benefits of such an architecture for various stakeholders are explained, and how the new architecture could be introduced smoothly in existing networks by small migration steps, also covering networks based on technologies other than ATM. It is shown that the approach can be scaled up to a very large QoS-aware overlay network for the Internet.",

   "abstract": "IP telephony will bring about a dramatic change in the way IP services are planned, provisioned, managed, and billed. In order to build and retain a strong customer base for these new services, service providers need to meet, if not exceed, the customer expectations set by today's traditional voice services. Acceptance of IP telephony will depend on the quality and efficiency with which service providers offer, deliver, and manage IP services. Installation, configuration, and activation must be rapid and error-free. Furthermore, customers will want direct control over the reconfiguration of services and real-time visibility into the impact change has on their operating costs. Once the service is activated, customers will want the provider to guarantee service quality as defined by industry standards. Corporate customers in particular will need to be assured that the provider is proactively monitoring performance to avoid problems and providing them visibility into the performance data collected. This article discusses an integrated management support system for IP-based networks illustrating the functions needed to support the unique challenges of managing VoIP services. An example of a service management system is also described.",

   "abstract": "The use of anycast service can considerably simplify many communication applications. Two approaches can be used for routing anycast packets. Single-path routing always uses the same path for anycast packets from a source, while multipath routing splits anycast traffic into several different paths. The former is simple and easy to implement, while the latter may potentially reduce congestion, improving delay and throughput performance. However, multipath routing may require additional cost to maintain multipath information. To take advantage of both approaches and overcome their shortcomings, we develop a set of integrated routing algorithms that can adaptively select a subset of routers in the network to carry out multipath routing for anycast messages. We demonstrate that systems using our integrated routing algorithms perform substantially better than those where either the single-path or multipath approach is used alone.",

Because the Internet supports data communications, a range of other services can be bundled together with Internet telephony. The Internet, however, was designed for non-real-time data communications, and hence it poses several technical challenges that must be overcome before the Internet can be successfully used for carrying telephone services. This article discusses new services we can expect from Internet telephony, the technical challenges and solutions, and the emerging products that promise to support Internet telephony.",

   "abstract": "JAIN/sup TM/, a set of integrated network APIs for the Java/sup TM/ platform, provides a framework to build and integrate solutions (or \"services\") that span across packet (e.g., IP or ATM), wireless, and PSTN networks. The objective of JAIN is to provide service portability, convergence, and secure access (by services residing outside of the network) to such integrated networks. JAIN is defined and specified by a large number of participating communication companies (the JAIN Community), and according to a well-documented process (the Java Community Process or JCP). The objective of the JAIN Community is to create an open market for services across integrated networks using Java technology. The authors provide the JAIN business case. They then summarize how the JAIN Community works, and introduce how the JAIN Community is organized. They also explain how separate JAIN work items fit together. In particular, they provide the rationale for the currently supported levels of abstraction (in terms of session/call signaling models) in JAIN, and look at possible implementation scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Future telecommunications networks will consist of integrated packet-switched (IP and/or ATM), circuit-switched (PSTN), and wireless networks. Service providers will offer a wide portfolio of innovative applications over these integrated networks. Doing so rapidly and efficiently requires open network APIs, with a key API being that for call control, as well as for coordination and transactions. The JAIN community is defining an API for Java call control and Java coordination and transactions. The JCC API defines the interface for applications to initiate and manipulate calls, while JCAT defines the facilities for applications to be invoked and return results before or during calls. Note that in this context a call refers to a multimedia, multiparty, multiprotocol communications session. The JCC/JCAT Edit Group of JAIN is in the process of defining the first version of the JCC/JCAT API specification, which is expected to be released in early 2000. This article describes the background of and motivation for the design of the JCC/JCAT API. We describe the AIN and JTAPI call models on which the JCC/JCAT API is based. We then describe the scope of JCC/JCAT and its relationship to other JAIN Edit Groups defining facilities for enabling service creation. Finally, we describe the requirements and example service drivers for JCC/JCAT, as well as the initial proposed design and structure for JCC and JCAT.",

Its history and its use of the real-time traffic flow measurement architecture to measure its traffic are described. The Kawaihiko members wanted a \"measured bandwidth\" metric which would be a good indicator of the bandwidth required to carry each site's traffic. Kawaihiko developed such a metric-the third-quartile day-based on a daily usage profile or third-quartile profile. The 3QP and 3QD are described in detail, and illustrated with typical plots from several of the Kawaihiko sites. The Kawaihiko members found 3QD to be an effective bandwidth measure, and 3QP a useful traffic management tool.",

   "abstract": "Local multipoint distribution systems (LMDS) represent a new radio-based access technology with cellular architecture offering flexible high-capacity connections to private users and organizations. The systems employ a point-to-multipoint broadcast downlink with a total capacity of 36-38 Mb/s per transport stream, giving high flexibility for inclusion of any type of data. The interactive channel, being a point-to-point connection, may employ different technologies depending on availability and user demand for capacity. This capacity may basically range from a few kilobits per second up to at least 25.6 Mb/s. LMDS performance relative to other broadband access technologies is discussed. A major remaining development task is the establishment and verification of methods for coverage of normally shielded areas. The availability of cheap repeaters and possibly reflectors for increased coverage is a must, which will significantly improve coverage.

   "abstract": "The rapid pace of development in both Internet applications and emerging optical technologies is bringing about fundamental changes in networking philosophies. Key trends are the emergence of dynamic wavelength provisioning and a corresponding reduction in wavelength provisioning timescales. As this transition continues, the current use of the wavelength-routing paradigm for carrying bursty Internet traffic will likely suffer from various shortcomings associated with circuit-switched networks. Meanwhile, optical packet switching technology is still facing significant cost and technological hurdles. Optical burst switching, or OBS, which represents a balance between circuit and packet switching, has opened up some exciting new dimensions in optical networking. This article describes the OBS paradigm, and also proposes the use of labeled OBS, or LOBS, as a natural control and provisioning solution under the ubiquitous IP multiprotocol label switching framework.",

   "abstract": "This article reviews the key differences between traditional IP routing and the emerging multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) approach, and identifies where MPLS adds value to IP networking. In various corners of the industry MPLS has been held up as the solution to IP QoS, gigabit forwarding, network scaling, and traffic engineering. Each of these expectations is critically considered in the light of developments in conventional gigabit IP routers. It is shown that MPLS adds the ability to forward packets over arbitrary non-shortest paths, and emulate high-speed \"tunnels\" between IP-only domains-capabilities critical to service providers who need to better manage resources around their backbones, or who are planning IP VPN services. However, it is also argued that the technology required to support IP QoS and gigabit forwarding is not unique to MPLS. A network of gigabit IP routers or switches may be entirely sufficient for QoS and performance if traffic engineering is not a requirement.",

   "abstract": "We propose a mechanism to perform fast handover in IP-based wireless networks for real-time applications such as Internet telephony and videoconferencing. Our proposal is designed to reestablish the communication session traffic flow quickly and to minimize the service disruption delay that occurs during mobile IP handover. In this scheme, we propose two different mechanisms to handle micromobility and inter-subdomain mobility, respectively. Micromobility handover handles movements within the same subdomain. Inter-subdomain handover supports handovers between two adjacent subdomains. The reason for having several subdomains is to deploy the network over a wider area to keep the mobile user in the same network for as long as possible. The novelty of the scheme is to retransmit the buffered packets during micromobility handover and to use multicasting to reestablish traffic flow during inter-subdomain movement. The entire scheme is performed within a hierarchical topology based on next-generation IP networks. We analyze both micromobility and inter-subdomain mobility handovers, and display simulation results for both voice and video over IP for micromobility handover.",

   "abstract": "Arango and Huitema (1998) were the first to propose a new architecture for voice-over-IP networks, physically separating call control from media and bearer control. This separation created the need for a new class of protocol to link the two units. The Media Gateway Control Protocol is now seeing limited deployment for that purpose. However, MGCP is optimized for circuit to packet voice connections and has a North American bias in the types of events it can handle. A new protocol has been standardized by the IETF Megaco Working Group working together with ITU-T Study Group 16, which has been published as both a standards-track RFC and ITU-T Recommendation H.248. This protocol extends media gateway control to include a transport-independent connection model, support for more advanced services such as multimedia conferencing, and support for operation in countries around the world. The present article provides a technical description of the features of Megaco/H.248.",

   "abstract": "The twisted pair copper access network was originally intended as a transmission medium for low-bandwidth analog voice signals. Unlike voiceband modems that operate in this frequency band, emerging high-speed digital transmission systems like ADSL and VDSL use a much larger spectrum. Because VDSL signals contain frequencies up to several megahertz, these broadband signals are susceptible to more hostile noise conditions. This article identifies the different noise impairments and shows how their effect can be mitigated in multicarrier-based VDSL systems.",

   "abstract": "This article presents an IN architecture that is based on distributed object and mobile agent technologies. It deviates from traditional IN in two prominent ways: first, by substituting message-based protocols with a CORBA distributed processing environment. The new communications infrastructure not only serves to convey IN flows, but also functions as a potent unifying location-transparent layer. Second, the new architecture makes heavy use of mobile agent technology. Service logic programs are implemented as mobile agents, and are thus not constrained to control the switch's operations remotely from a central location. Instead, they can migrate and control its operations locally. The infrastructure elements of the architecture exploit this ability of service logic programs by cloning them and dragging their clones to the appropriate locations in response to excess processing or signaling load. The architecture is in this way self-balancing, in contrast to the centralized nature of traditional IN. A prototype implementation is presented along with a service creation framework that enables the IN service designer to disregard environment-related issues and concentrate on the IN logic of the services per se.",

The functions and RF configuration of the mobile terminal, the services it supports, and the applications accessible to it can all be selected, installed, and executed on demand. Mobile middleware provides the glue that matches the requirements of the applications and their users to the capabilities of the terminals and networks. The state of the art in distributed processing systems built on an Internet platform must be integrated with advanced telecommunications functions of the intelligent network and UMTS to provide the environment in which this middleware operates. We explore the issues of integration, the components of mobile middleware, and likely demands placed on such systems when mobile access comes to dominate personal communications.",

A multimedia dictionary Internet application may offer needed help in everyday activities as well as in distance-learning systems. A multimedia dictionary is considered as both a conventional dictionary tool and a distance-learning network application. We analyze the architecture and implementation issues arising in the design and implementation of a multimedia dictionary network application. The application is considered multimedia since it is designed to support textual, visual, and audio information content. Practical implementation is shown to be feasible with current technology, but a lack of available multimedia standards has been recognized. This is why we have considered the existing standards as well as the standards in development. The application is developed in Java language, and may be run as either a standalone application or an applet. The latter entails accessibility in a ubiquitous manner to a large number of users. The application is intended for both non-native English users and professionals exposed to specific technical terminology.",

   "abstract": "We describe our approach to monitoring and managing the bandwidth of an Internet edge link with a view toward certain quality of service objectives for the services it carries. Such a link could be, for example, a campus's Internet access link or a small ISP's backbone access link. We use SNMP polls and packet snooping to obtain traffic statistics, and TCP admission control for bandwidth management. Our implementation is completely nonintrusive: we use Ethernet packet capture in the promiscuous mode for traffic analysis, and IP masquerading for blocking new TCP connections. This approach has been implemented by us in a software system for traffic management. We first justify our approach with a simple analytical model. We give an overview of our software implementation, and discuss some implementation issues. Then we provide measurement results that show the effectiveness of the techniques.",

   "abstract": "Expanding Internet-based services are driving the need for evermore bandwidth in the network backbone. These needs will grow further as new real-time multimedia applications become more feasible and pervasive. Currently, there is no other technology on the horizon that can effectively meet such a demand for bandwidth in the transport infrastructure other than WDM technology. This technology enables incremental and quick provisioning up to and beyond two orders of magnitude of today's fiber bandwidth levels. This precludes the need to deploy additional cabling and having to contend with right-of-way issues, a key advantage. Hence, it is only natural that over time optical/WDM technology will migrate closer to the end users, from core to regional, metropolitan, and ultimately access networks. At present, WDM deployment is mostly point-to-point and uses SONET/SDH as the standard layer for interfacing to the higher layers of the protocol stack. However, large-scale efforts are underway to develop standards and products that will eliminate one or more of these intermediate layers (e.g., SONET/SDH, ATM) and run IP directly over the WDM layer. IP over WDM has been envisioned as the winning combination due to the ability of the IP to be the common revenue-generating convergence sublayer and WDM as a bandwidth-rich transport sublayer. Various important concerns still need to be addressed regarding IP-WDM integration. These include lightpath routing coupled with tighter interworkings with IP routing and resource management protocols, survivability provisioning, framing/monitoring solutions, and others.",

   "abstract": "Transmission media carrying Internet traffic present a wide range of characteristics, some of which, such as transmission errors, long end-to-end delay, and bandwidth asymmetry, may cause a degradation of the TCP performance. Many works have studied the performance of TCP over these media, most of which focus on a particular network type. In this work we study TCP performance independent of the type of network by considering the different possible characteristics of the connection path. We present the problems and the different proposed solutions. This study permits us to understand the limitations of the actual solutions and the required modifications to let TCP cope with a heterogeneous Internet on an end-to-end basis.",

   "abstract": "Previous advances in WDM technology are now beginning to shift the focus more toward optical networking and network-level issues. Providing survivability at the optical layer is inherently attractive, but whether it makes practical sense, given similar mechanisms that are already available at the higher layers, poses serious challenges and raises many questions. Today's core network architecture model has functional overlap among its layers, contains outdated functionality, and is too slow to scale. If IP can be mapped directly onto the WDM layer, some of the unnecessary network layers can be eliminated, opening up new possibilities for developing a simple and integrated-protection/restoration scheme that can be coordinated at both the IP and WDM layers. This article presents an overview of existing optical protection/restoration schemes. Then we present a novel mesh-based hybrid optical protection scheme that utilizes multifiber physical links along with a hierarchical OXC structure. An overview of the envisioned IP-centric DWDM-based optical data network architecture is then presented. The basis of how to implement a more direct IP standard-based approach for closer and efficient IP-WDM integration is also discussed. Finally, we articulate a view of how to provide a joint protection/restoration scheme that is coordinated at both the IP and WDM layers.",

   "abstract": "While the Internet has quietly served as a research and education vehicle for more than two decades, the last few years have witnessed its tremendous growth and its great potential for providing a wide variety of services. As a result, input-queued switching architectures, because of their distinguished advantage in building scalable switches, are currently receiving a lot of attention from both academia and industry as an attractive alternative for developing future-generation ATM/IP switches/routers. However, the problem of designing scheduling algorithms with QoS guarantees for input-queued switches has always been known to be a very challenging problem. We give an overview of the efforts in designing scheduling algorithms capable of providing QoS guarantees for input-queued switches. These algorithms are classified under three categories: those based on slot time assignment, those based on maximal matching, and those based on stable matching. We also present some open problems on this topic as future research directions in this area.",

   "abstract": "The desire for new business growth has been a major driving force towards the development of open network APIs, such as the Parlay API, within telecommunications networks. The Parlay API enables both third parties (external companies, operating outside the security domain of the network operator) and network operators to build new applications that rely on real-time control of network resources. The Java APIs for integrated networks (JAIN/sup TM/) Community is defining a Java version of the Parlay API to bring the benefits of the Java language to the Parlay API, and to promote industry-wide adoption of the Parlay API. This article describes the background and rationale behind the work of the Parlay Group, together with the characteristics, structure, and capabilities of the Parlay API. The benefits that Java and the JAIN Community bring to the Parlay API are then explored. A technical overview of the Java version of the Parlay API, referred to as the JAIN Parlay Edit Group API, is given and illustrated using example sequence diagrams. The article concludes by taking a look at what additional features may be added to the API and the implementation activities that lay ahead.",

Creating this open boundary between the electrical and optical domains is the central goal of the Optical Domain Service Interconnect, a coalition of more than 100 companies formed in 2000. ODSI is working to provide an interface to the optical network that can quickly implement and deploy bandwidth on demand. The initiative previously defined a specification for interoperability. Once in use, network elements at the edge of the intelligent optical network can establish optical paths in real time, as demanded by bandwidth demands or needed to support new and innovative high-speed services.",

Instead, we argue that an extensive telecom-style network management interface augmented with a minimal control plane and a service layer interface between management systems is more appropriate for the real needs of the optical layer. This approach will allow more flexibility in extending the interoperability between vendors and carriers as our understanding of these networks grows, increase the reliability of the network, and be a better fit for the telecom service provider. On the other hand, the simplicity of use and automation the Internet control plane promises can just as easily be achieved with our proposal.",

In contrast, taking a services-based view provides a way to distinguish between protection schemes based on implementation costs and the associated services enabled by the protection scheme.",

   "abstract": "The US Patent Office is now issuing patents on propagated data signals that embody computer programs. Result: patent infringement can now occur in a mouse click. While patents have always been available for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter, the extension of patent law to computer data signals is new. After losing a series of battles in the courts, the Patent Office now considers a computer program embodied in a carrier wave to be a manufacture, and hence patentable subject matter. This rather surprising development provides a powerful weapon against software patent infringement over the Internet; and it represents a dangerous snare for the telecommunications industry. Is there anything beyond the reach of patent law? The Supreme Court remains steadfast in this: patents cannot be obtained for abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena.",

   "abstract": "Real-time communications services over the Internet need a new architecture to meet their required quality. From a viewpoint of quality of service provisioning architecture, the Internet can mainly be divided into three types of subnetworks: domain networks, access networks, and stub networks. In this article we focus on issues arising in the former two networks for end-to-end QoS provisioning. First, the access networks are of rather low-speed links, so delay is still of major concern. We examine the statistical delay bound through numerical results derived from our analysis. Schemes to reduce delay are proposed, and their performance is evaluated. Next, domain networks are likely to be of very high-speed links, which can accommodate a huge number of voice flows of low bit rates. Thus, effective flow management will be of major concern because per-flow management is a very costly proposition. Therefore, we pay attention to a flow aggregation scheme, and evaluate its performance by analyzing its blocking probability.",

   "abstract": "The Czech Republic has made significant advances in the development of its communications industry during the post-1989 era. These advances include partial privatization and significant capital investment in the fixed line and mobile infrastructure, market liberalization moving toward ending of monopoly in most market segments, and creation of huge demand for communication services of all types among business and residential consumers. As in more developed countries, the communications market in the Czech Republic has grown increasingly complex over the past 10 years. Indeed, the Czech communications market has developed well beyond the point where it can be adequately described purely in terms of number of fixed lines installed, teledensity, and the waiting list for basic telephone service. Therefore, the factors that will be critical in the next stage of market development must also be considered. These factors include the commitment to finalize market liberalization and end even partial state ownership of incumbents, the ability to attract a wide range of local startups and international telecom companies as competitors to the incumbents and each other, and the ability of those competitors to offer a cross-section of services including voice, data, and video as bundled services directly to the end consumer. This profile examines the Czech communications market, describing the players, the main issues they face, and their strategies for future growth.",

These trade-offs include time to market, risk, flexibility, power consumption, and cost. A key issue is the processing power required to implement the modem. The article takes a detailed look at the processing power required to implement an ADSL or VDSL modem on a programmable platform. It is demonstrated that today's digital signal processors meet the processing power requirements for an ADSL modem, and it is estimated that the processing requirements of a VDSL modem will be met in the near future.",

   "abstract": "The Internet is under rapid growth and continuous evolution in order to accommodate an increasingly large number of applications with diverse service requirements. In particular, Internet telephony, or voice over IP is one of the most promising services currently being deployed. Besides the potentially significant cost reduction, Internet telephony can offer many new features and easier integration with widely adopted Web-based services. Despite these advantages, there still exist a number of barriers to the widespread deployment of Internet telephony. The most prominent one, however, is how to ensure the QoS needed for voice conversation. The purpose of this article is to survey the state-of-the-art technologies in enabling the QoS support for voice communications in the next-generation Internet. In this article, we first review the existing technologies in supporting voice over IP networks, including the basic mechanisms in the IETF Internet telephony architecture and ITU-T H.323-related Recommendations. We then discuss the IETF QoS framework, specifically the Intserv and Diffserv framework. Finally, we present two leading companies' (Cisco and Lucent) solutions to offering IP telephony services as examples to illustrate how real systems are implemented.",

   "abstract": "This article investigates the problem of call admission control in cellular networks using code-division multiple access, which is mainly viewed as an interference management problem. Our approach is to study the effects of various system parameters and user profile characteristics on the generation of multiple access interference (MAI). Different CAC schemes are presented, and different user and system characteristics that affect the CDMA system operation are listed. The focus of our work is on the emerging third-generation wireless systems and particularly on the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. Analytical and simulation tools were constructed for quantifying these system characteristics. The results obtained by these two models show that the outage probability for a system is very sensitive to the user bit rate and quality of service requirements. The combination of different service types has a significant effect too; even a small number of high-bit-rate users can degrade the low-bit-rate users' performance and considerably increase their outage probability. The use of a CAC algorithm is expected to guarantee the service offered to accepted users.",

   "abstract": "Research suggests that joint methods combining smart antennas, RAKE reception, multi-user detection or other adaptive methods may be practically implemented for IMT-2000 channel modems using computationally simplified algorithms. Using software-defined radio methods, these modems can be employed in a new generation of adaptive multimode base stations which permit software reconfiguration from second- to third-generation air interfaces. Practical implementation is made possible by corresponding advances in hardware technology, including new processors and high-bandwidth I/O fabrics which replace traditional computer buses with their inherent limitations in bandwidth and scalability. In this article adaptive processing research is reviewed, implementation requirements for second- and third-generation base stations are considered, and the capabilities of selected new monolithic silicon devices are examined. A possible implementation approach for a reconfigurable multimode base station channel modem using software defined radio (SDR) design methods is proposed.",

NTT has developed several types of photonic transport systems. They are an optical path cross-connect system which has little quality of service monitoring large-scale integration circuit for each wavelength; a photonic transport payload assembler-disassembler, which accommodates client signals into optical path payloads and vice versa; and a repeater. The implementation of a PTS is depicted. A network-element-level operating system and an optical-network-level operating system are required to operate the WDM photonic transport network. We introduce a TMN-based network operating system. Finally, an overview of NTT's photonic transport network trial is presented.",

   "abstract": "Software radio terminals must be able to process many various communications standards. These standards are generally based on different master clock rates and thus employ different bit/chip rates. The most obvious solution to cope with the diversity of master clock rates in one terminal is to provide a dedicated master clock for each standard of operation. Not only too costly, this kind of solution limits the applicability of a realized terminal. Hence, it is much more elegant to run the terminal on a fixed clock rate, and perform digital sample rate conversion controlled by software.",

   "abstract": "Communication satellites can be used to broadcast large volumes of data directly to extensive user groups. With the latest generation of high-powered direct broadcast satellites and the changing traffic and usage patterns in the Internet, new ways of using satellites for delivering data directly to the end user have become viable alternatives to terrestrial point-to-point networks. In this article the software architecture of a distributed system, which has been successfully implemented and which supports online and offline interactive multimedia services, is presented. It is based on a method of carrying Internet datagrams over DVB/MPEG-2 transport systems, intended for digital television. It relies on a configuration using a broadband forward channel and a separate, usually narrowband, return channel. The forward link is usually provided by a geostationary satellite, whereas the return channel uses a different network technology, such as dialup connection, a direct Ku-band return link, a LEO satellite network, or an LMDS local distribution system. A generic multicast system is presented which exploits the inherent capabilities of satellites to reach a large number of customers. The reliable multicast strategy chosen is shown to handle multiple applications, each with different reliability and timing requirements.",

   "abstract": "For future multimedia applications, satellites might play an important role. For broadcast applications satellites are ideally suited to illuminate a large geographical area. However, multimedia applications are interactive, and are therefore a combination of a broadcast mission and a multipoint-to-point mission. The natural question is, can a satellite system compete with the capacity provided by terrestrial cable networks? If the answer is positive, and it shown in this article that it is, a second question arises: what new developments are required to migrate from the state-of-the art satellite technology to such advanced concepts? Taking the example of the European Space Agency's activities in this field, an overview of the required building blocks which make up a complete multimedia communication satellite system are described. Based on this technological overview a discussion of the systems developed by European space industries with support from the European Space Agency is given.",

   "abstract": "Large input-output buffering with a moderate speedup has been widely considered as the most feasible solution for large-capacity switches. We propose a new terabit per second packet switch and call it the Saturn switch. It uses a simple dual round-robin arbitration scheme to schedule packets, and achieves high throughput and low statistical delay bound. It employs a bit-sliced crossbar fabric to switch packets at 10 Gb/s at inputs and outputs, and adopts a novel token-tunneling technique to arbitrate contending packets at high speed (e.g., within 10 ns), thus achieving a switch capacity of more than 1 Tb/s with existing electronic technology.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a scalable multi-QoS IP+ATM switch router architecture. The proposed switch router is based on a core ATM switching system with multi-QoS capability. Forwarding engines and a routing engine are attached in front of the line cards of the ATM switching system. The FEs and RE are interconnected with each other via internal VCs. A novel longest matching algorithm is employed at the FE to achieve packet forwarding at wire-speed of OC-12c rate (622.08 Mb/s). Wire-speed unicast and multicast packet forwarding are performed using point-to-point and point-to-multipoint VCs in a unified way. Because FEs and RE are decoupled from the base ATM switching system, the full spectrum of ATM QoS capability is nicely applied for IP QoS control with a packet classification at the edge of the network. The core switching fabric is scalable from 40 to 160 Gb/s capacity (371 MPPS in terms of packet forwarding throughput). Feedback rate control is employed at each line card to eliminate congestion in the high-speed core switching fabric even with a small amount of buffer.",

   "abstract": "Proposals for programmable network infrastructures, such as active networks and open signaling, provide programmers with access to network resources and data structures. The motivation for providing these interfaces is accelerated introduction of new services, but exposure of the interfaces introduces many new security risks. We describe some of the security issues raised by active networks. We then describe our secure active network environment (SANE) architecture. SANE was designed as a security infrastructure for active networks, and was implemented in the SwitchWare architecture. SANE restricts the actions that loaded modules can perform by restricting the resources that can be named; this is further extended to remote invocation by means of cryptographic credentials. SANE can be extended to support restricted control of quality of service in a programmable network element. The Piglet lightweight device kernel provides a \"virtual clock\" type of scheduling discipline for network traffic, and exports several tuning knobs with which the clock can be adjusted. The ALIEN active loader provides safe access to these knobs to modules that operate on the network element. Thus, the proposed SQoSH architecture is able to provide safe, secure access to network resources, while allowing these resources to be managed by end users needing customized networking services. A desirable consequence of SQoSH's integration of access control and resource control is that a large class of denial-of-service attacks, unaddressed solely with access control and cryptographic protocols, can now be prevented.",

   "abstract": "Active networking is an expanding field of research. It includes the ability to easily install and modify customized network services and to process packets within the network in a customized way. This article addresses the question of how the benefits of active networking can be exploited in an environment where a large number of customers must share a common network infrastructure. We introduce a management framework for active networks that allows customers to deploy and manage their own active services in a provider domain. The key concept in our framework is the virtual active network. From the customer perspective, the VAN represents an environment in which the customer can install, run, and manage active services without interaction with the VAN provider. From the VAN provider perspective, the VAN represents the object of resource partitioning and customer isolation. Active networking combined with the VAN concept allows for new business models in the telecom industry.",

Some specific characteristics of the VDSL transceiver startup procedure and high-level architecture, as well as a summary of first laboratory tests and field trials, are also presented. The article concentrates on VDSL implementations using single-carrier modulation, which integrates the well-known carrierless amplitude/phase modulation and quadrature amplitude modulation technologies. Currently, SCM technology is considered one of the main candidates for the VDSL standard in the United States and Europe, and internationally.",

Although VDSL and ADSL systems are similar from the point of view of transmission technology, there are differences in the architecture and implementation due to both the higher bandwidth and shorter copper loop length for VDSL. The VDSL drivers are given in the introduction. The next section describes the system architecture and the functionality of the various building blocks. Special attention is paid to optical feeder technology, for which APON is a well-suited technology. Concepts to reduce the cost of ownership are also discussed.",

More attention has been given to devices and technologies that can be exploited to enable WDM to move from being a pure transmission technology into a state where it can be applied in transparent all-optical networks. In particular, devices and technologies such as wavelength routing switches, switched sources, tunable sources, tunable filters, and wavelength converters have all been developed and demonstrated. This article gives a description of the technologies, subsystems, and network architectures that rely on multiple wavelengths to achieve full transparent all-optical connectivity joined, in many instances, with features like scalability, modularity, and survivability. Exposure is also given to most of the current WDM demonstrators.",

As network structures and cost topologies are in many respects turned upside down, so the business structure will be. One conclusion is that since access is the stronghold of the new technologies, there is a strong local advantage. This means that we will move toward a business arena in which bundling and value chains as we know them today are dead concepts; there will be strict separation of infrastructure and services, and numerous other changes that basically are the opposites of what we are used to today.",

   "abstract": "National telecommunications has undergone significant changes. Some of these changes and the main principles of the national telecommunications system are described. First the milestones of the previous years are considered. Afterward, the structure of the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the basis of national telecommunications, is presented. We then deal with statistics and forecasting. Two tables present the development of the main telecommunication networks. A third table allows us to compare telecommunications development in the republics of the former USSR. Three figures show the forecasts of the main indexes of future telecommunications. General evolution tendencies inherent in Russian telecommunications are described next, including new technologies and services. One example related to modern equipment application is described. Finally, we deal with aspects of Russian telecommunications liberalization.",

   "abstract": "Previous years have brought interesting developments in the field of telecommunications all over the world. Countries in transition have experienced it in their own way. Croatia is an interesting example of such a country. After gaining independence in 1991 and setting course toward the open market economy, the development of telecommunications was particularly fast. Related legislative changes as well as changes in the ownership structure of Croatian telecom will surely have a significant impact on the future development of telecommunications in Croatia, which will be based on our own experiences as well as the experiences of other countries in transition and developed countries. The planning methodology will include the techno-economic evaluation of minimum-risk introductory routes for new services as defined within the European Union projects. An overview of the development of Croatian telecommunications during the '90s as well as plans for future development are presented. A comparison with other countries in development as well as with developed countries is given, too. A survey of the development of telecommunications within the County of Split and Dalmatia, including economic aspects, is given. An overview of research and development activities is also given.",

One example is an e-mail alerting service that uses the telephony network for e-mail notification. The EMA system is a computer telephony integration (CTI) application that checks a user's mailbox on the mail server and informs him/her over the phone when new e-mail arrives, eliminating the need for permanent Internet connection. The EMA system has a Web-based interface, enabling the user to configure service parameters. The EMA system is developed as a distributed and concurrent application. It consists of seven modules: the console, Web interface, Web handler, controller, voice machine, database, and mail checker, using communication solutions based on component object model (COM) technology. This article describes the structure of the EMA system, its implementation, and advantages for users.",

   "abstract": "The High Altitude Long Operation Network/sup TM/ is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network, with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. The HALO/Proteus airplane is the central node of this network. It will fly at altitudes higher than 51,000 ft. The signal footprint of the network, its \"Cone of Commerce\", will have a diameter on the scale of 100 km. The initial capacity of the network will be on the scale of 10 Gb/s, with growth beyond 100 Gb/s. The network will serve the communications needs of each subscriber with bit rates in the multimegabit per second range. A variety of spectrum bands licensed by the FCC for commercial wireless services could provide the needed millimeter wavelength carrier bandwidth. An attractive choice for the subscriber links is the LMDS band. The airplane's fuselage can house switching circuitry and fast digital network functions. An MMW antenna array and its related components will be located in a pod suspended below the aircraft fuselage. The antenna array will produce many beams, typically more than 100. Adjacent beams will be separated in frequency. Electronic beamforming techniques can be used to stabilize the beams on the ground, as the airplane flies within its station keeping volume. For the alternative of aircraft-fixed beams, the beams will traverse over a user location, while the airplane maintains station overhead, and the virtual path will be changed to accomplish the beam-to-beam handoff. For each isolated city to be served, a fleet of three aircraft will be operated in shifts to achieve around-the-clock service. In deployments where multiple cities will be served from a common primary flight base, the fleet will be sized for allocating, on average, two aircraft per city to be served. Flight operational tactics will be steadily evolved and refined to achieve continuous presence of the node above each city. Many services will be provided, including but not limited to T1 access, ISDN access, Web browsing, high-resolution videoconferencing, large file transfers, and Ethernet LAN bridging.",

   "abstract": "Programmable networks allow third parties to dynamically reprogram switches and routers in order to extend their functionality. This approach facilitates new capabilities such as dynamic reallocation of resources, automated healing from malfunctions and failures, customized information processing, and easier service creation. These capabilities enable rapid customization of the network by providing mechanisms to adapt to new applications such as multimedia, multicast, intrusion detection, and intranet firewalls. We describe Intel's framework for programmable networks, known as Phoenix. The objective of the Phoenix framework is to make it easier to deploy new network services that leverage the emerging trend toward use of reprogrammable network processors. To accomplish this goal the Phoenix framework defines an extensible mobile agent system and a set of device functionality abstractions for utilizing and extending network capabilities. We also discuss how the open interfaces provided by the Phoenix framework can be utilized to deploy new network services.",

   "abstract": "The extraordinary network challenges presented by high energy nuclear and particle physics experiments has created a need for network monitoring both to understand present performance and to allocate resources to optimize performance between laboratories, and the universities and institutes collaborating on present and future experiments. The resulting Internet end-to-end performance monitoring project is called PingER. The monitoring infrastructure reflects the wide geographical spread of the collaborations, and involves a large number of research and commercial networks. The architecture of the data acquisition and methodology of the analysis have evolved over several years, and are described here in their present state. The strengths and weaknesses of the project are reviewed, and the derived metrics are discussed in terms of their diagnostic functions. The observed short-term effects and long-term trends are reviewed, and plans for future developments are described.",

This article first defines QoS and introduces a taxonomy for QoS mechanisms. The evolution of several major QoS mechanisms is described with a special focus on RSVP and differentiated services. Special attention is paid to the role of the IETF in developing QoS mechanisms. We describe a QoS network that combines RSVP and differentiated services in a manner that realizes the benefits of each. We show that, in general, the adoption of increasingly sophisticated QoS mechanisms can enhance the ability of a network to offer high-quality service guarantees while simultaneously making efficient use of raw network resources. These mechanisms carry a cost in the form of increased overhead, which must be weighed against the benefits of the mechanism.",

   "abstract": "Patent policies issued by standard-setting organizations help resolve the tension between enforcing patent rights and adopting open standards. In this article we examine the application of these policies to patent licensing and enforcement situations. An industry standard consists of a specified set of technologies adopted by an industry group in order to effect compatibility among products. The tension between enforcing proprietary intellectual property rights and adopting open industry standards has become a central issue for standards-setting bodies as well as the courts called on to enforce patent rights. As patent rights become more and more prominent in the global economy, the issues presented by the incorporation of patented technology into standards have become increasingly important. The ideal of open, widely promulgated standards is at odds with a patent owner's right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented invention. The ability of an industry member to exclude others from practicing a standard by asserting a patent that covers the standard would serve to undermine rapid and widespread adoption of the standard, resulting in reduced value of the standard. To prevent this situation, standard-setting organizations have developed patent policies that require their members to disclose intellectual property that may impact a proposed standard. Furthermore, patent owners are required to either forgo enforcement of patent rights against standard users, or promise to license their patents to all comers at a fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory rate. Such a policy resolves many of the tensions between proprietary technology and the desire for an open, widely practiced standard. However, the implementation of such a policy is not as straightforward as may at first appear.",

   "abstract": "The forthcoming mobile communication systems are expected to provide a wide variety of services, from high-quality voice to high-definition videos, through high data rate wireless channels anywhere in the world. The high data rate requires broad frequency bands, and sufficient broadband can be achieved in higher frequency bands such as microwave, Ka-band, and millimeter-wave. Broadband wireless channels have to be connected to broadband fixed networks such as the Internet and local area networks. The future-generation systems will include not only cellular phones, but also many new types of communication systems such as broadband wireless access systems, millimeter-wave LANs, intelligent transport systems, and high altitude stratospheric platform station systems. Key to the future generations of mobile communications are multimedia communications, wireless access to broadband fixed networks, and seamless roaming among different systems. This article discusses future-generation mobile communication systems.",

   "abstract": "The increasing use of telecommunications, particularly the development of e-commerce, is steadily increasing the opportunities for crime in many guises, especially IT-related crime. In response, there is an urgent new demand for forensic computing, that is, the examination of IT equipment and systems in order to obtain information for criminal or civil investigations. This field is not yet well developed, but its needs will in the future begin to influence telecommunications as investigations are extended to include the use of the communications infrastructures and services. IT security technologies alone are not sufficient to deal with this. The telecommunications industry, its customers, and regulators will face difficult challenges in the provision and use of systems that will be safe, reliable, and auditable. These challenges will need solutions addressing technical, legal, regulatory, and social issues and will not be easily resolved. This article summarizes the state of forensic computing, its likely future development, and its impact on telecommunications, and identifies several research and development issues.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a network paradigm called the single-server-view network as the basis for networks in the 21st century, when the value of a network to users will be based on the services provided rather than data communication capability. Based on our paradigm, we propose a double-plane network architecture, consisting of a simplified data forwarding plane and a service control plane, that performs all the complex processing tasks. The data forwarding plane uses an advanced photonic network as its basis. The service control plane consists of agent, service, and policy control layers with open interfaces between layers. Leading-edge information processing technologies, such as active node, agent, distributed processing, and policy-based management, are used in this plane. Since mobile communication is becoming a major access technology, an approach to integrating mobile and fixed networks into this framework is also proposed. The current status of key technologies, such as photonic networks, agent technology, and policy-based management, are reported.",

   "abstract": "Mobile telephony and the Internet are the fastest growing businesses in the telecommunications market. This is why most operators and service providers are looking after the development of new services in both sectors, and newcomers are expected to enter the arena. The mobile operators foresee an increasing share of their revenues coming from new data services, while Internet service providers are attracted to wireless technology and mobility services both to reduce costs within the last-mile segment and to enrich their market share, providing ubiquitous access to the Internet and corporate intranets. In this scenario several wireless overlay networks will coexist, and their interworking will be a challenging objective. The employment of Internet technology, with its novel mobility and security extensions, seems to be the most attractive option for achieving that goal. In addition, the migration to a full IP network architecture, even within each specific wireless domain, will be another promising opportunity, already under consideration within several technical and standardization bodies. The envisioned role of Internet technology makes it worthwhile to undertake significant research efforts on the development of innovative IP-based mobile data systems, and opens promising opportunities for both telcos and Internet service providers.",

   "abstract": "Since early 1980 an exponential blowup of cellular mobile systems has been observed, which has produced, all over the world, the definition of a plethora of analog and digital standards. In 2000 the industrial competition between Asia, Europe, and America promises a very difficult path toward the definition of a unique standard for future mobile systems, although market analyses underline the trading benefits of a common worldwide standard. It is therefore in this field that the software radio concept is emerging as a potential pragmatic solution: a software implementation of the user terminal able to dynamically adapt to the radio environment in which it is, time by time, located. In fact, the term software radio stands for radio functionalities defined by software, meaning the possibility to define by software the typical functionality of a radio interface, usually implemented in TX and RX equipment by dedicated hardware. The presence of the software defining the radio interface necessarily implies the use of DSPs to replace dedicated hardware, to execute, in real time, the necessary software. In this article objectives, advantages, problem areas, and technological challenges of software radio are addressed. In particular, SW radio transceiver architecture, possible SW implementation, and its download are analyzed.",

   "abstract": "An optical broadband access network called APON (ATM-based Passive Optical Network) has been standardized and its commercial deployment started. This article discusses possible evolution scenarios for the APON system with respect to bit rate, range, and splitting factor, leading to the SuperPON concept. Technical challenges encountered during the realization of the SuperPON demonstrator within the European ACTS project PLANET are discussed in detail. In addition, to illustrate when these technologies will become commercially viable, the major results of an economic-feasibility study are presented. Finally, the SuperPON integration in the pan-European trial of the ACTS PELICAN project is described.",

   "abstract": "The process, referred to as unbundling, of allowing alternative operators to use the copper twisted wire pairs installed and owned by the local or national monopoly telephone operator is currently underway in many parts of the world. Not entirely without reason, most see this as a purely economical and legal matter, but it also has a surprisingly large impact on the engineering of broadband communication systems. This applies to the standardization and design phase as well as to the deployment phase. We survey the background of unbundling, and the goals and thinking of a regulator, and elaborate on the technical impact of unbundling. Examples are taken from VDSL standardization and the regulatory situation in various European countries.",

   "abstract": "We present a novel methodology for identifying internal network performance characteristics based on end-to-end multicast measurements. The methodology, solidly grounded on statistical estimation theory, can be used to characterize the internal loss and delay behavior of a network. Measurements on the MBone have been used to validate the approach in the case of losses. Extensive simulation experiments provide further validation of the approach, not only for losses, but also for delays. We also describe our strategy for deploying the methodology on the Internet. This includes the continued development of the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure to support RTP-based end-to-end multicast measurements and the development of software tools to analyze the traces. Once complete, this combined software/hardware infrastructure will provide a service for understanding and forecasting the performance of the Internet.",

   "abstract": "After 10 years of advances in silicon RF integration, what used to be an art is becoming a \"normal practice\". Historically, RF design was the art of s-parameters, shielding, impedance matching, and standing wave ratios. Modern silicon RFICs are designed using the same SPICE-like tools as in low-frequency analog ICs with the addition of important software for system-level simulation and mixer circuit noise analysis. New RF design practices away from the 50 ohm culture, novel chip architectures, and powerful technological advances will drive radio integration toward the ultimate single-chip phone. The obstacles in this quest are high system requirements on noise figure, substrate crosstalk, and parasitic coupling, not the silicon IC technology.",

   "abstract": "Cellular mobile telecommunications and the World Wide Web are growing at an exciting pace. In the year 1999 both GSM and the Internet reached more than 200 million registered users globally. Thus, it may be expected that users will demand the combination of mobility and multimedia services in a foreseeable time frame. Multimedia content increases and differentiates with the changing information society, and an even richer variety of audio, visual, and text-based information will be required in the future. UMTS, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, a member of the IMT-2000 family of third-generation systems, will provide these services. UMTS standardization has set a new paradigm of timely market-driven standardization in a global partnership of standardization bodies.",

   "abstract": "Migration strategies for the network control infrastructure are discussed, to evolve carrier networks toward an optical transport backbone optimized for IP traffic. The strategies presented aim to protect carriers' investments in their current multiservice and IP-routed networks, while expediting the backbone migration toward a unified packet-over-optical core for IP and multiservice transport. This unified core network simplifies the network layers and control systems, and consolidates data and multiservice traffic to reduce network cost with improved bandwidth efficiency. The network control system, including signaling, addressing, and routing, is analyzed in detail to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed infrastructure. Built on multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) technology, the presented solutions take phased evolution steps to reduce network cost, improve bandwidth efficiency, and offer practical options for internetworking during the migration. These solutions provide carriers with competitive advantages to consolidate multiple services onto an IP-centric optical transport network. The unified control infrastructure not only offers flexible options for network upgrade with reduced network management overhead, but also supports enhanced networking and traffic engineering capabilities to ensure no compromise in the service level agreement committed to end customers.",

   "abstract": "The Internet and developments in the mobile domain have fueled the first stage of what appears to be a paradigm shift of societal dimensions. Access technologies and standards are created almost daily, each taking a very specific view of user needs while generally disregarding the rest of the world. Radio spectrum may become, in a relatively short time, one of the most important economic commodities. Simple and fast access to this commodity will become a major issue. New service paradigms are bound to lead to cyclic infrastructure renewal, the investment volume of which cannot possibly support future widespread technical development and economic growth in this area. New technologies, enabling network evolution on the micro level and thus avoiding costly network infrastructure paradigm shifts, may be much better suited to adequately support the societal transition to the information age. In order to release the full economic potential of mobile communications, it is deemed worthwhile to research in depth possibilities, requirements, and performance of an open mobile access system, which is not yet another mobile access system but rather a fundamental set of scalable physical principles and parameters having the technical potential to satisfy any conceivable application in any conceivable radio environment, when combined with heterogeneous backbone networks and future enhanced versions of the Internet protocol. The authors have developed a coarse but integral view of a wireless access network which may satisfy the key requirements of a user- and business-centered radio access and service network.",

   "abstract": "This article explores VoIP mobility in the context of IP and cellular networks interworking. ITU-T Rec. H.323 gateways provide the interconnection between IP networks and switched circuit networks. They allow a call originating from an SCN phone to be transmitted over an IP network to an H.323 terminal, or bridged to another SCN phone. While H.323 provides interoperability with other SCN terminals, the major efforts have been focused on IP/wired SCN (PSTN, ISDN, etc.) interworking. In this article we discuss the challenges associated with the interworking between IP networks and cellular networks through H.323 gateways, and propose an innovative approach using the existing call transfer supplementary service to provide VoIP mobility in the H.323 IP telephony networks. The proposed approach uses existing components in the H.323 standard, thereby allowing VoIP mobility service in hybrid IP/cellular networks to be a value-added feature in the existing H.323-compliant Internet telephony systems.",

   "abstract": "Signaling has been one of the key areas of Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies since inception. H.323 was the key protocol that allowed interoperability of VoIP products and moved the industry away from the initial proprietary solutions. Once the VoIP industry started maturing, some limitations of H.323 came to light. In this article we provide an overview of H.323, describe its capabilities, and discuss how its limitations are being addressed using the concept of gateway decomposition. We also discuss how H.323 can coexist with other protocols such as MGCP, H.248, and SIP which are attracting a lot of interest in the VoIP industry today.",

   "abstract": "We overview a digital duplex scheme called Zipper, intended for DMT-based VDSL systems. The Zipper multicarrier duplex scheme represents a breakthrough toward digital implementation of frequency-division duplexing. A duplex scheme is a method to divide the capacity of a line between the upstream and downstream directions. Zipper divides the available bandwidth by assigning different subcarriers for the different directions. As a prerequisite, DMT symbols are extended with an additional cyclic suffix, and are shaped at both the transmitter and receiver. Zipper is characterized by high flexibility and high spectral compatibility with programmable spectrum usage, robustness against frequency-selective impairments such as radio frequency interference and bridge taps, interoperability with ADSL, and high spectral efficiency since no guard bands are needed.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes iGSM: a voice-over-IP value-added service for the mobile network. The iGSM service provides user mobility to subscribers, which allows them to use either GSM handsets or H.323 terminals (IP phones or PCs) to access telecommunications services. We describe how the iGSM registration, deregistration, and call delivery procedures can be implemented without modifying the GSM network. We study how the tromboning effect in the standard GSM system can be avoided when accessing the IP network. Then we investigate the misrouting problem caused by user mobility.",
