      "abstract": "The foundation for the interconnected society of the 21st century is being built today. The key to having this become a reality is the availability of compatible national, regional, and global communications standards. Committee T1 Telecommunications has played increasing important standards development roles in the US and global telecommunications industries. Committee Tl's dual roles of a US standards developer and an initiator of global standards harmonization contribute to satisfying the users' desires that it be as easy to communicate across the country or around the world as it is to communicate across the street. The key technologies of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), personal communications services (PCS), and synchronous optical network (SONET) are but a few of the topics for which standards have been developed in Committee T1, and for which standardization of extensions and enhancements continue. These areas have also been among the topics Committee T1 has targeted for standards harmonization.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The authors use a use a simple pointer-variable updating technique in the sending phase of their refined buffer cut-through scheme. Binary tree traversal is not required. Time is saved in allocating (and later deallocating) buffers for storing usually short data transfer protocol headers. Their scheme saves working buffer space for segmenting and linking of protocol data units. Because a simple linked list is constructed in the receiving phase, significant working buffer space can be saved. Each node of the linked list points to a user data segment. During the linked-list traversal, user data is copied directly to the user process when a node is visited.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The article examines the use of ATM to address the growth of emerging narrowband services such as frame relay. ATM's flexibility in supporting variable rates and levels of service make it an ideal network technology to carry multiple services. While B-ISDN services promise many benefits to users, major issues must be addressed before such services can be available on a large scale. Utilizing ATM as a backbone technology to support the growing capacity needs of emerging narrowband services could facilitate more rapid introduction of ATM into the network infrastructure and speed delivery of future BISDN services.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "LAN emulation offers a best-effort, connectionless, packet transfer service at the MAC sublayer, implemented on top of a connection-oriented ATM network LAN emulation using switched virtual connections requires address resolution to locate the destination end station followed by connection establishment to the resulting ATM address. Address resolution may be implemented by a broadcast technique or by an address server. The broadcast method is the simplest for small networks but a combination of both is probably better. The use of the MAC address to identify an end station, with dynamic binding to its current physical location in the ATM network, allows the ATM LAN segment to be viewed as a virtual LAN. The virtual LAN model permits end stations to move and change physical location while maintaining connection to the same ATM LAN segment. This greatly simplifies the management of large data networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "An ADSL-3 architecture providing a downstream payload above 6 Mb/s has been proposed for operation over carrier serving area (CSA) loops. To determine whether such a system can be reliably deployed in the telephone company copper loop plant, a detailed model for loops and noise is presented. Results show that a sophisticated system, including echo cancellation and trellis coding, can reliably achieve CSA coverage, if T1 is not present in the plant. In the presence of assumed T1 worst case conditions, either the downstream bit rate must be reduced, or the operating range needs to be decreased to a serving area smaller than the CSA. A smaller \"mid-CSA\" serving area is proposed, and it is demonstrated that a 6.3-Mb/s ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) system can operate in the presence of T1 in adjacent binder groups over this smaller serving area, which is roughly defined by 6 kilofeet of 26 gauge and 8 kilofeet of 24 gauge. A statistical study utilizing actual T1 line data suggests that if CSA coverage is attempted in the presence of T1 in adjacent binder groups, a success rate of greater than 92 percent can be expected.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "As essentially none of the existing telecommunication networks are capable of providing interactive video services (IVS), network providers have begun to consider the network architecture that is best to deploy. Two approaches have received most of the consideration. Because of the embedded base of broadcast, coax-based cable TV networks and because of the unconfirmed demand for IVS, much attention has been paid to upgrading these networks to provide IVS transport even though extensive modification would be required. These networks are referred to as passband networks because of the use of modulated subcarriers as the signal transport mechanism. The alternative approach under consideration is the use of fiber-to-the-curb transport systems. Because such networks transport IVS directly as baseband signals without subcarrier modulation, they are known as baseband networks. The paper compares the baseband and passband approaches in several areas including: compatibility with the optical transmission medium; compatibility with IVS source/sink equipment; compatibility with the emerging telecommunications interoffice and feeder networks; and the cost of deployment. The recent history in which passband and baseband approaches competed to become the preferred transport mechanism in LAN applications is reviewed. The fact that in that case baseband emerged as the preferred approach has important implications for the selection of the preferred approach in today's IVS applications. The constituent elements and transport requirements of the end-to-end network for delivering IVS are reviewed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The basic features of heterodyne systems are reviewed, especially the use of multicarriers, tunability, and selectivity. Then specific application areas that may benefit from flexible multicarrier allocation schemes are discussed. Examples are taken from the RACE Phase II project R2065, coherent optical systems implemented for business traffic routing and access (COBRA). Next, trends and progress in heterodyne systems in general and related key components are summarized, and then examples of ongoing field trials in Europe are discussed. Finally, the coherent multicarrier technology are compared briefly with direct detection multiwavelength technology.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In order to provide solutions to this dilemma, there have been many techniques proposed. We describe and evaluate the architectural and conceptual alternatives available for the implementation of a connectionless service for public ATM networks. We also suggest a scheme through which best-effort connectionless service may be provided in public ATM networks using connectionless servers and hop-by-hop flow control. There is as yet no consensus on issues such as bandwidth management, address resolution, connectionless server forwarding modes, or connectionless server topology, and therefore much of the area remains open for research. These research issues must be addressed, however, in order to realize the interoperability, and thereby the acceptance, of ATM.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The telecommunications industry is rapidly evolving from the plain old telephone service (POTS) era of the last 100 years into a sophisticated multimedia era. Organizational and operational structures are also rapidly changing worldwide, and standards-making procedures and organizational structures are changing accordingly. In this article, a fresh development in setting telecommunications standards is introduced, one that mainly concerns the Interregional Telecommunications Standards Conference (ITSC) and its successor, the Global Standards Collaboration (GSC), which could well be called the ''Standards Summit.'' The relationship between ITSC/GSC and IEEE activities are also be addressed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The telecommunications infrastructure is becoming more commonly recognized as a key factor in socioeconomic development, and as an important business requirement to successfully compete in the global market. The need for highly integrated, complex, effective solutions, in a timely manner, has stimulated changes in the standards setting environment. These changes include rapid standards development, effective reorganization, and the implementation of electronic data handling systems. This overview of the global standards environment provides an illustration of the recent changes in the international, regional, and national arenas. The need for conformity of communication products with these global standards has never been greater. This is mandated by the need for greater production quantities to justify costly complex system development, as well as a ubiquitous solution for a worldwide network. The trend that telecommunications systems are becoming larger, more sophisticated, and more integrated makes the development of the systems and standards more difficult and time consuming. This is providing a challenge to the standards community, since they need to develop effective standards rapidly.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

An efficient CPN interconnection via end-to-end VP pipe therefore would be an attractive application. The possible migration scenario of ATM-CPN is presented, the required functions and services in future CPN are clarified for each evolutional stage, i.e., the introductory, expansion and diffusion stages, and the importance of medium-bit-rate SB interfaces is described.

What is needed is a clear picture of protocol architectures and traffic characteristics of the various applications to be supported both now and in the future. The authors discuss ATM network architectures with special focus on the support of connectionless LAN interconnection and show which benefits can be obtained from the introduction of a connectionless server in an ATM network. They outline issues related to the use of existing protocols when ATM networks are introduced and show which protocol complexities have to be handled by gateways and servers, again using the example of connectionless LAN interconnection. Having presented network and protocol architectures the issue of data communication in ATM, resource allocation, is treated.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

For example, a contract acceptance is more sensitive than a notice of goods delivery. One requires more integrity and assurance. One will be retained, the other discarded. In the paper-based world, signatures provide a degree of assurance for the more important messages. The means by which the handwritten signature concept can be translated into the new electronic medium is discussed. Cryptologic techniques (such as \"digital signatures\") may be employed to obtain similar assurances in an electronic form.

This article discusses modulation and channel coding issues related to digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB), such as data throughput, spectrum efficiency, single- and multicarrier modulations, interferences under simulcasting conditions, multilayer services, and DTTB coverage. Current advanced television (ATV) research for terrestrial broadcasting in the VHF/UHF bands is converging toward a fully digital implementation. In a digital ATV system, the digitized high definition video sources, with raw bit rate of up to l-Gb/s, are compressed using source coding techniques based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding. The output data rate of the video source encoder, with present technology, is typically 15 to 20 Mb/s. This data rate is sufficient to provide a satisfactory distribution quality video service.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Because of a radio spectrum shortage below about 17 GHz, frequencies in the Ka- and higher spectral bands are seen as good candidates for Earth-space communications in the future. New challenges in propagation research include the characterization of mobile/personal links and the investigation of higher bands for satellite communications. An example of the radiowave propagation scenarios is illustrated where the mobile terminal, with a low-gain antenna, operates in frequencies below 10 GHz and is faced with propagation anomalies caused by shadowing, Doppler, and multipath effects. The fixed terminal, with a high-gain antenna, operates at frequencies above 10 GHz and suffers from atmospheric effects.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The European Economic Community's (EC) RACE program (Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe) started with a definition phase in 1986. The main effort of the first phase was aimed at customer access connections (CACs) and customer premises networks (CPNs), as well as identification of services that will use these high-speed networks. In the second phase, which began in 1992, RACE projects are focused on managing the high data rates generated by these networks and the need for high-capacity transport networks. The greater functionality required and the large number of multiuser applications operating simultaneously within and between organizations generates data rates, both intra- and intersite, on the order of tens of Gb/s. Such high data rates will spur the market for gigabit networks. At the start of the RACE program, some projects were devoted to integrating interactive and distributive services into one ATM-based electrical user network interface. The main motivation was the use of the same fiber for different services to the subscriber. The RACE projects demonstrate fiber-based broadband infrastructures for local access.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Widespread use of personal computers (PCs) and PC networks is leading to a strongly increased demand for WAN data services in terms of number of accesses and required bandwidth. Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN) and broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) have the potential to satisfy, respectively, the existing and developing requirements. However, a flexible evolution path needs to be identified for the provision of ISDN access facilities. Frame relaying and frame switching are prime candidates for such a common access facility, although not necessarily intrinsic B-ISDN data services. The article gives an overview of frame relaying and frame switching as possible candidates for harmonized access to N-ISDN and B-ISDN. Pre-ISDN, N-ISDN, and B-ISDN services with their characteristics in terms of cost and performance are first described. It is shown how frame relaying and switching are positioned with respect to the identified service requirements. Then some examples are given of selected scenarios, and the role played by specifically frame relaying to provide access to B-ISDN services, offering at the same time a seamless evolutionary path from N-ISDN to B-ISDN. The position of frame relaying and switching is discussed first in respect to application requirements, and then in architectural terms. Frame relay (and frame switching) services are then identified as services that provide the necessary low threshold and short lead time for rapid market penetration, in order to allow applications to indirectly take advantage of the benefits of ATM services.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

In order to reduce initial costs for broadband services, an ATM-based platform must be constructed for various services. In particular, existing public switched telephone network (PSTN) services can be economically accommodated in ATM-based broadband networks, and the costly part of the network could be shared by dominant PSTN services. This article proposes a granulated broadband network (GBN) concept as an intermediate platform for achieving broadband aspects of ISDN (B-ISDN).&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

We begin with the quality principles that provide the foundation for the initiatives and then move to describe the initiatives and their effects on members, employees, suppliers, and the technical communities served by the IEEE. The quality principles upon which the initiatives are based are few and unambiguous: the customer comes first; all work is part of a process; suppliers are an integral part of our business; quality happens through people; prevention is achieved through planning; and quality improvement never ends. We use these quality principles to guide the management of all parts of the IEEE in order to meet the needs of our members, other customers, employees, suppliers, and the technical communities we serve.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The author discusses the ISDN Staged Transport System (STS). The STS illustrates how an ISDN network can be used as a flexible distribution medium for directing real-time signals over a WAN to a staged transport server. Although the signal feeds distributed by the STS application are audio voice grade circuits (VGCs), the architecture lends itself to other signal types, such as video. Moreover, ISDN bridges and routers allow the real-time communications infrastructure to distribute bulk recorded signals as well. Finally, the multimedia wide-area connectivity provided by ISDN allows an entire signal processing operation to be remoted, with receivers, storage, and mission control all managed from a single site (or multiple sites) on the network. While the STS application uses the user to user information element (UU-IE) to control signal processing on the edge of the ISDN network, the UU-IE could just as easily be used on the interior of the network by switch adjuncts to augment dialed number routing with intelligent-application-based routing. When combined with the rich set of commercially available applications available on many ISDN switches and adjuncts, sophisticated signal processing, distribution, and management networks could be rapidly configured and deployed with relative ease.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The secret of successful TQM is integration of all elements. Some of the most important lessons learned have centered around the issue of interfacing people with numbers. For engineers, data that can translate vague generalities, hunches, and customer complaints into an equation that can be analyzed, is highly valued. The promise of that level of objectivity and clarity has led to an explosion of measurement across all functions of the telecommunications industry. The optimal interface between people and numbers at Northern Telecom is being achieved through a collection of small steps, slight alterations, and through the merging of theories across a range of disciplines that includes psychology, statistics, organizational development, and the most valuable discipline of all, common sense. The challenge has been to engage people to use the numbers generated by TQM, to train people to differentiate between meaningful measures and meaningless numbers, and to directly link all measurements with constructive action that affects the ultimate goal: customer satisfaction.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It uses a new type of customer premises-based equipment that makes use of existing network services to provide significantly enhanced functionality, rather than requiring a new and yet-to-be-implemented set of capabilities to be added to the network. This puts more control into users' hands. Inverse multiplexers provide the ability to dial up multimegabit-per-second digital connections without requiring significant changes to the network itself. It is this ability to use currently available network offerings in a new and highly useful manner that makes inverse multiplexing such a valuable addition to the corporate networking toolbox.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The article describes the EES and the KES. Particular emphasis is given to security, since potential users have been concerned that the hooks which provide authorized government access could be exploited or abused. It describes many of the safeguards that have gone into the design of the KES in order to ensure that the risk of unauthorized access to EES-encrypted communications is negligible.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Chile has experienced important successes, and several serious mistakes, as the country struggles with the telecommunications revolution. Deregulation in Chile began in the late '70s, during which period the subscriber terminal market was opened. This allowed competition in the terminal equipment market. Other substantial steps have included the decision to grant subscribers certain rights on the telephone line and authorization for third parties to make installations of terminal equipment. As to the Chilean privatization process, it is evident that privatization has followed the government's subsidiary principle adopted in 1974 as one of the country's most important guidelines of its economic philosophy. In 1980, the principle was incorporated into the Political Constitution and all the sector policies, including the telecommunication National Policy and corresponding laws.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Observation across a large number of projects run to ISO 9001 standards has been used to develop a framework for assessing the fitness of a software project. This is based on three key areas that combine to yield true quality, people, product, and process. The authors review their experience with process based assessment methods. A short description of each is given, along with the main lessons that have been learned through their application. They concentrate on approaches that have been in used for some time and are mature. They build on the lessons of using process assessment as a lever to improve software quality. From their experiences observing a large number of real projects, they found that a more rounded set of criteria are required to assess real quality.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Their impact on the traffic characteristics of the coder provides insights into the cell arrival process for an MPEG source. The authors obtain video source models for coders that utilize a standard algorithm that can be applied to a multitude of video services. The output stream of a video coder, which complies with the Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) coding standard, is studied with an National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) quality video sequence as the input. Because the MPEG video coding algorithm has been proposed for a variety of applications, they also investigate the effect of changing the coding parameters on the statistics of interest.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Multi-rate ISDN provides a simple way to extend ISDN network services to match the higher bandwidth requirements emerging for videoconferencing, multimedia, imaging, and other high-speed applications. Using this technology, network service providers can offer high-speed connectivity within the boundaries and benefits of existing, circuit-switched, central office and transmission equipment.

      "abstract": "Optical networking is attracting a large amount of interest, particularly for local access and increasingly for long-haul, or core, network applications. However, optical networks are essentially analog, and with this return to analog transmission there are a number of issues that need to be understood and overcome if the concept of an optical transport layer is to become a reality. The Multi-Wavelength Transport Network (MWTN) within the European RACE II research program is studying the potential for optical networking in a managed network environment. This article outlines the MWTN networking concept and the comprehensive experimental test bed developed within the project. Communication networks are poised, awaiting the broadband revolution. Telecommunication, computer, and broadcast entertainment market places are converging with multimedia-based future services providing the drive and focus. In such an information-intensive future, customers will demand high-performance service with an agreed and measurable quality at the lowest cost. Furthermore, they will expect a common interface to all services. From a customer's perspective, the role of the network, the terminal equipment and the computer based multimedia application will be virtually indistinguishable. The synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) techniques are at the forefront of the move toward these future communication networks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Computer security is a hard problem. Security on networked computers is much harder. Firewalls (barriers between two networks), when used properly, can provide a significant increase in computer security. The authors classify firewalls into three main categories: packet filtering, circuit gateways, and application gateways. Commonly, more than one of these is used at the same time. Their examples and discussion relate to UNIX systems and programs. The majority of multiuser machines on the Internet run some version of the UNIX operating system. Most application-level gateways are implemented in UNIX. This is not to say that other operating systems are more secure; however, there are fewer of them on the Internet, and they are less popular as targets for that reason. But the principles and philosophy apply to network gateways built on other operating systems as well. Their focus is on the TCP/IP protocol suite, especially as used on the Internet.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Its purpose is to safely convey information between layer 3 entities using the D-channel. The information types that LAPD is intended to transport include call control signaling, packet mode communications, and management information. Observations are made in this article about what are, in the authors' opinion, the most confusing points of CCITT Recommendation Q.921 with comments related to data link layer address field, broadcast connections, terminal endpoint identifier (TEI) management procedures, layer 2 frames exchange, and connection management entity response to MDL-error indication primitives. This article intends solely to clarify the recommendations so that their concepts and procedures become easier to understand and implement, which can lead to significant saving of time for those who must eventually use LAPD procedures or develop the software for handling them.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

An FITL system comprises a host digital terminal (HDT) connected to some number of optical network units (ONUs) via a fiber optic passive distribution network (PDN). Each ONU provides metallic service interfaces via short drops consisting of metallic wire pairs or coaxial cable. FITL systems that carry plain old telephony services (POTS) are referred to as \"POTS FITL\" systems. FITL systems that deliver VDT services or combined VDT and telephony services are referred to as \"VDT FITL\" systems. There are a number of architectural alternatives for VDT FITL, including configurations involving the use of parallel technologies for transporting video signals in the distribution.

      "abstract": "The vision of an all-fiber telecommunications network delivering an ever increasing variety of services to both business and residential customers has been the subject of much speculation for more than a decade. However, although optical fibers are now used routinely for longer haul transmission and for connections to large business customers; fiber to provide the final link to the generality of customers has proved to be a tougher challenge than originally expected. The extent to which fiber will penetrate the network depends not only on technical capabilities and economic performance, but also on regulation, competition, and the types of service that customers will actually want. The interplay between these complex factors is discussed, and potential scenarios are described. An endpoint vision of a future broadband infrastructure is described in order to illustrate the major new service delivery and operational benefits, which can flow from the revolutionary new technologies that can now be unleashed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "To utilize the large bandwidth of optical fiber, optical LANs must employ architectures that fundamentally differ from current single-channel LAN architectures. With computer processor speeds continuing to grow exponentially and multimedia applications growing even faster, there is a strong need for higher-speed local area networks (LANs) that can handle the traffic generated by tomorrow's LAN users. Optical fiber is well suited for high-speed traffic transport, but the busty nature of computer traffic and large number of users makes it difficult to utilize the fiber's capacity in LANs. The incorporation of multiple payload channels in future LANs is seen as a necessity; WDM is a good candidate for achieving this. The rapidly improving optical component technologies allow more flexible WDM architecture designs for various emerging applications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The recent advances in optical time division multiplexed (OTDM) systems and components research show the technique to be highly suited to the generation and transmission of high capacity data on a single optical carrier. This approach uses a single wavelength to carry capacities of at least 40 Gb/s. Such systems are based on a clock frequency and tributary data rates which are easily accessible using electronic components. Short optical pulses are used in a return-to-zero data transmission format with temporal interleaving to map a number of optical data channels into a single electronic clock cycle. It is an approach that can be used to achieve extremely high data-rate bit interleaved systems. This article summarizes the developments in this field and outlines a possible methodology to evolve transport networks to encompass the potential that both WDM and OTDM have to offer.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "As customer satisfaction continues to drive businesses, telecommunications companies are forging partnerships that are aimed at the common goals of improved quality, reduced costs, and business success. The evolved customer/supplier partnering model that is being applied in the telecommunications and other industries is illustrated. This model promotes an \"us\" relationship focused on mutual success, contrasted to the \"we/they\" relationship supported by the historical view. This article provides examples of customer/supplier partnering as it exists in today's U.S. telecommunications industry. The authors provide an overview and several specific processes that exemplify the growing move toward customer/supplier partnering. Three perspectives are offered: that of the service provider, the service provider agent, and the system supplier.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

This article begins with a short introduction of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), its structure and main responsibilities, before focusing on global standardization at ITU. But first one must take note of one important point: on March 1, 1993 a major structural reform of the ITU was implemented. Among other important changes, CCITT ceased to exist, and was resurrected as the new ''ITU Standardization Sector.'' It is for this reason that the readers will find the term ''CCITT'' used for the standardization activities up to February 28, 1993; after this date, the new term ''ITU Standardization Sector'' (ITU-T) will be applied. The same situation exists for many other terms as well. It is hoped that the explanations provided in the text are clear enough to assist readers in understanding which new terms have come into use to replace the traditional terms that have been in use for so many years.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

How does the unwanted signal power vary as mobile users roam in an area covered by the main-beam and the sidelobes of the fixed service? What effects do the parameters of FPLMTS (transmitter power, bandwidth, etc.) and the parameters of the fixed service (antenna directivity, power, bandwidth, etc.) have on the unwanted signal power levels? How is the unwanted power level affected by the path geometry, in particular fixed service antenna height and propagation conditions (congested areas) between the mobile and fixed stations?.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Mobile communication systems present several design challenges that stem from the mobility of users throughout the system and the time-varying multipath channel and interference. To address these challenges, future wireless modems will rely on performance enhancing techniques such as adaptive antennas, DSP-based interference rejection techniques, and real-time signal processing for capacity improvement. The authors present an overview of key simulation issues for wireless communications systems. First, the burst error characteristics of the mobile channel require the selection of appropriate performance measures. Second, accurate simulations require realistic channel models that include the effects of attenuation, multipath propagation, noise, and interference. Third, link-level simulation of wireless systems requires attention to details of system implementation including the effects of nonlinearities. Finally, efficient simulation of CDMA systems may require a combination of analytic and simulation techniques.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The challenge is to accurately predict network performance and behavior for a rapidly changing environment, and for the very large networks that are encountered in the public telephone system. This paper describes the discrete event modeling of SS7 signaling networks that enable dynamic network analysis for very large, highly realistic, network models. The primary distinction between the authors approach and related work is the development of a very detailed model, one that incorporates most SS7 message-handling and network-management procedures. Their approach is aimed at accurately reproducing dynamic network behavior at a level similar to the models described by Hutchinson and Patten (1986), and Unger and Bidulock (1982) . They define network simulation objectives and the SS7 model components and functions, and then give a brief overview of how a specific network model is created, including a description of the model's implementation and how it was validated. They also discuss a model and simulation experiments for a large part of the Ameritech network.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The authors define the types of simulation software that are available for network analyses and also discuss desirable features for such products. They then present brief descriptions of seven prominent simulation products, emphasizing their approach to building a simulation model. They also give a four-activity approach for selecting a simulation package for an organization or a particular application. A general reference for the simulation concepts discussed in this article is Law and Kelton (1991).&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Many large industries are beginning to decide whether they will use simple, low-speed data communications. These low-speed services may be the first data services that most small business and residence customers buy because the market already needs them. As a group, they are called teleaction services. The term teleaction means \"acting at a distance.\" The actions include reading or writing some information to remote locations, or possibly both. Instead of sending a person to set or read some information on a device, it is done remotely via a communications network. This form of data collection is especially useful when coupled with a computer system that could use the data to initiate action. Currently, some of these services have low market penetration. However, the market need for them is real, and potential users consistently express interest in them. The challenge is to be able to deliver them in a cost-effective way. The purpose of the article is to provide a review of these services. The author provides a classification and an overview of current and emerging services with an emphasis on the specific business aspects of each service and each market segment. Then, the business drivers are discussed from the perspectives of the end user, the service provider, and the communications carrier.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "The article provides a review of the standards and architectures that can be used to implement teleaction services. Although they are already penetrating the market and are recognized as having substantial potential for growth, the work on standardization of these services is not complete. The article analyzes the variety of implementation architectures and standards that may be deployed; illustrates the cost benefits that can be achieved by deploying new technologies; and guides the standardization process by identifying the critical areas where standards will have maximum impact on business development. Drawing an architectural framework for the provision of teleaction services, the authors identify the generic capabilities for the support of teleaction services and analyze the main architectural implementations for teleaction services. Several types of networks based on existing technology are reviewed. ISDN-based implementations and their associated standards are described, and aspects such as protocols, interconnection of networks, and migration from current arrangements to ISDN implementations are analyzed. Quality of service (QOS) is of central importance. Requirements for QOS are reviewed mainly by reviewing some of the European standards. The significant progress in standardization of home systems is considered and a review of the major products and technical trends in home systems and their use as customer premises equipment for teleaction services is then presented. Finally, the authors review a system under development in Denmark and draw some conclusions.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Despite daunting social and economic obstacles, the country has set a goal of one telephone per hundred people by the year 2000. To accelerate the improvements necessary in the telecommunication sector in Tanzania, the government restructured the sector under the 1993 Parliamentary Acts which, among other things, sought to: limit the government's role in setting sector policy on telecommunications; and establish an independent regulatory body to regulate operator(s) and administer government sector policy.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

By and large, governments should adopt a \"serve it or lose it\" policy to require carriers to meet the paid demand for new service within a given time or face the prospect of having a competing company licensed to provide service or having portions of their service territory refranchized to other carriers. Regulation has been the weakest part of sector reform in poorer countries. If this deficiency is not addressed, ambitious plans for expansion are likely to be compromised. Effective regulation is important for attracting substantial amounts of private capital to telecommunications.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The widespread availability of these services will promote the nation's economic advancement and the decentralization of the government's activities. To achieve the objective of bringing telecommunications to all the people of Ghana, private sector participation is considered essential as a source of management skills, technology, and financing that will be required for the provision of services. In order to attract such participation, Ghana is putting in place the necessary policy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks to create an enabling environment for private sector investment in the telecommunication sector.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

It is the result of research activities addressed to B-ISDN development and carried out in the framework of the Telecommunication Project, a five-year Italian research program organized and supported by the National Research Council (CNR). The aim of the test-bed is to realize a flexible local network environment where critical issues related to the introduction of ATM techniques can be investigated, including signaling, internetworking, and service support, in addition to the basic switching technology. The emphasis is on flexibility and comprehensiveness of features and functionalities, rather than performance and technology. Beyond the technology issues related to the implementation, one of the major aspects of the test-bed is the collaborative development of its various building blocks.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The fundamental goal of the international community in this sector is to achieve universal access to basic telecommunications services. In this context, restructuring is but one component, although the global challenge is to work together to ensure that the restructuring revolution paves the way to filling the development gap. It is readily admitted that new technologies such as mobile satellite systems enable developing countries to leapfrog their infrastructure problems, and that governments recognize the potential benefits of these new technologies and the need to reform regulations in order to facilitate the introduction of these services.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

Many individuals supporting the public utility paradigm for telecommunications do so on the basis that if telecommunications were left at the whims of the free market system, its monopolistic nature would manifest, leaving one private monopoly firm to occupy the field. The author demonstrates that (1) telecommunications is not a natural monopoly and (2) the best environment for telecommunications is the free-enterprise system.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

The associated progression of managerial processes, such as inspection, quality assessments, and strategic quality planning are presented. The development of of tools and methodology, e.g., sampling plans, storyboards, robust designs, and quality awards are highlighted. Primary examples are presented of applications and results from the USA, Japan and the UK. Additional examples are drawn from the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany and Italy.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

DT must optimize the integration of the various generations of technical systems into all areas of the telecommunications network and develop strategies for launching products and services to rapidly achieve advantages in productivity. Because of the interaction of growing process and product innovation and the resulting synergy, this will rapidly improve the performance of the network and lead to reduced costs in years to come. This article gives an overview of the general conditions under which DT is implementing fiber-in-the-loop (FITL) and describes the technology used. It also presents DT's complementary strategy for the use of SDH technology in the access area.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Inverse multiplexing refers to the process of aggregating channels to allow applications greater freedom in selecting the optimum communication bandwidth and cost. The history of the Bandwidth On Demand Interoperability Group (BONDING) standard and its relationship to current and emerging network architectures are discussed. Applications of bandwidth-on-demand products to videoconferencing, multimedia, and LAN interconnection are described with respect to current and future equipment capabilities. Many data transmission applications require transmission at bit rates higher than those available from carriers. Services are most cost effectively provided if they have characteristics common among many user applications. The present paper describes an increasingly popular solution to this problem given today's expanding switched digital networks. Referred to as \"inverse multiplexers\" current implementations are providing national and international connectivity for diverse applications involving high-quality videoconferencing, variable-demand LAN interconnections, and low-cost network backup.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Simple and flexible photonic networks will provide the basic technologies for the telecommunication networks of the 21st century, broadband-ISDN, and fiber-to-the-home. It is recognized that SDH and ATM systems have much difficulty increasing the throughput by electrical signal processing technologies, such as signal processing speed, latency, and so on. Photonic networks have the potential to solve these problems and to construct ultra-high-capacity, simple, and flexible transport networks. This becomes very promising with the development of optical fiber amplifier and other new optical device technologies. This article reviews trends in optical transmission technologies and discusses the possibilities of the photonic network. Conceptual photonic network examples for the transport network, access network, and customer premises network considering the present network are shown. Future research items for constructing the photonic network are also discussed.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Although all-optical networks were being thought about almost ten years ago, until recently it would have been premature to talk about such networks as being truly usable. Now, ways of removing most of the roadblocks to practicality have come clearly into view. It is generally agreed that time-division packet switching in the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is likely to constitute the next generation of networking, both local and wide area; but what about the generation after that? While people are evolving SONET/ATM, the present Internet, and such emerging ambitions as the National Information Infrastructure (NII), in order to serve the needs anticipated for the next decade, optical fiber is being steadily installed at a rate of 700 miles per day in the United States alone. Furthermore, this resource is being extended steadily outward from the telco or cable provider backbone into customer premises, so that within the lifetime of the ATM generation, we may expect extremely rich fiber connectivity of a large number of homes and offices.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "With the deregulation and emergence of new telecommunication providers in many countries, national and international standards committees have assumed increased responsibility for the cooperative planning of new technology development and the matching of multivendor service offerings with user needs. One important focus of this effort has been the standardization of user-oriented, technology-independent measures of telecommunication service quality. The standardized measures will be used by providers to design and implement telecommunication systems and services, and by users to define telecommunication requirements and select the products that most effectively meet them. The authors discuss in particular call processing, data communication quality, video and voice quality measures.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",

      "abstract": "Interest in wireless indoor communications has been spectacular. As we tend to need relatively broad bandwidths for such communication, the choice of carrier frequency would seem to be between the millimeter-wave/upper microwave bands and infra-red. The authors consider those systems which operate with one cell or multiple cells within a room. Such systems in the longer term must offer speeds compatible with fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) or the integrated broadband communications network (IBCN). Keeping this in mind, the authors look at the capability of systems supporting transmission rates of 100 Mb/s, though of course useful networks can be realized with much lower single user data transfer rates. As with mmw, infrared (IR) radiation is essentially restricted to the room in which it is generated; apart from leakage through windows and doors it will not normally be detected outside a room and should not interfere significantly with similar systems in neighboring offices. However, IR is not suitable for operation in very large rooms. In addition it is seen that mmw offers certain advantages in both large and small rooms.&lt;<ETX>&gt;</ETX>",
