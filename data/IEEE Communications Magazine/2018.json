      "abstract": "By placing active antennas in a 2D grid at a BS, 3D MIMO is considered as a promising and practical technique for 5G New Radio (NR). So far, 3D MIMO studies reported are mostly done with antenna elements from 32 up to 128 in the limited scenario at one frequency. To gain further insights into the 3D massive MIMO channel and performance, field measurements from 32 to 256 antenna elements at the transmitter and 16 antenna elements at the receiver are performed in three typical deployment scenarios, including outdoor to indoor, urban microcell, and urban macrocell at both 3.5 and 6 GHz frequencies with 200 MHz bandwidth. Based on the extracted channel information from measured data, power angle spectrum, root mean square angle spread, channel capacity, and eigenvalue spread have been studied. Several observations, including 3D MIMO channel spatial dispersive properties and multi-user performance varying with antenna number, scenario, and frequency are given. These findings can provide valuable experimental insights for efficient utilization of 3D MIMO with massive antenna elements.",

      "abstract": "The use of license-exempt bands offers a promising opportunity to additionally enhance operator networks to meet the future traffic demand. The recent specification efforts in 3GPP have resulted in two major aggregation features that enable LTE networks to benefit from unlicensed spectrum via WLAN. In this article, we provide a thorough overview of these features known as, LTE-WLAN aggregation (LWA) and LTE-WLAN radio level integration with IP security tunnel (LWIP). The article presents and motivates the design choices of protocol architectures, procedures, mobility, and security. It also proposes flow control algorithms suitable for both technologies, which aim at the best usage of licensed and unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show the performance unveiling the potential gains of these features in different load conditions, also in a comparative manner, showing that LWA substantially outperforms LWIP.",

      "abstract": "In the 3GPP LTE Release 13, NB-IoT and LTE for Machine-Type Communication (LTE-M) were standardized to provide wide-area connectivity for IoT. The technologies in 3GPP Release 14 evolved beyond the basic functionality specified in Release 13. In 3GPP Release 15 the evolution continues. To optimize the support for infrequent small data packet transmissions, a mechanism for data transmission during the random access procedure is specified for NB-IoT and LTE-M. This mechanism, hereafter referred to as Early Data Transmission (EDT), improves the device battery life and reduces the message latency. This article provides a description of the EDT feature and presents simulated results for the expected battery life and message latency for a set of typical IoT traffic models. For a device in extreme coverage, EDT can enable improved battery life by almost 3 years and reduce message latency by more than 3 seconds compared to the Release 13 performance. Although the absolute gains are highest for devices in challenging radio conditions, significant relative gains are also presented for devices in good coverage.",

      "abstract": "Future cellular systems will employ the so-called big three technologies: UDN, massive MIMO, and mmWave (and/or terahertz) communications. The goal is to support the explosive demands for mobile broadband services foreseen for the next decade. In this work, we investigate the joint impact of the three technologies. Using system-level simulations, we evaluate the performance of two-tier cellular networks with \u03bc Wave macrocells and densely deployed mmWave small cells. Our results show that much higher capacity can be realized with UDNs than in macrocell-only setups. The results also reveal that performance does not scale proportionally with increase in the employed mmWave bandwidth. The corresponding increase in noise (due to larger bandwidths) reduces the SINR. Outdoor users experience promising data rates notwithstanding, but the throughputs of indoor users are highly degraded. This is due to the additional wall and indoor losses (on top of the inherently high path loss at mmWave frequencies), which further reduce the SINR of indoor users. Therefore, techniques that significantly enhance the SINR are highly import ant design considerations in unleashing the amazing prospects and potentials of mmWave UDNs.",

      "abstract": "5G is ongoing, and it is an emerging platform that not only aims to augment existing but also introduce a plethora of novel applications that require ultra-reliable low-latency communication. It is a new radio access technology that provides building blocks to retrofit existing platforms (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, and WiFi) for greater coverage, accessibility, and higher network density with respect to cells and devices. It implies that 5G aims to satisfy a diverse set of communication requirements of the various stakeholders. Among the stakeholders, vehicles, in particular, will benefit from 5G at both the system and application levels. The authors present a tutorial perspective on vehicular communications using the building blocks provided by 5G. First, we identify and describe key requirements of emerging vehicular communications and assess existing standards to determine their limitations. Then we provide a glimpse of the adopted 5G architecture and identify some of its promising salient features for vehicular communications. Finally, key 5G building blocks (i.e., proximity services, mobile edge computing and network slicing) are explored in the context of vehicular communications, and associated design challenges are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless networking and big data technologies, such as 5G networks, medical big data analytics, and the Internet of Things, along with recent developments in wearable computing and artificial intelligence, are enabling the development and implementation of innovative diabetes monitoring systems and applications. Due to the life-long and systematic harm suffered by diabetes patients, it is critical to design effective methods for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Based on our comprehensive investigation, this article classifies those methods into Diabetes 1.0 and Diabetes 2.0, which exhibit deficiencies in terms of networking and intelligence. Thus, our goal is to design a sustainable, cost-effective, and intelligent diabetes diagnosis solution with personalized treatment. In this article, we first propose the 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines the state-of-the-art technologies such as wearable 2.0, machine learning, and big data to generate comprehensive sensing and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. Then we present the data sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes. Finally, we build a 5G-Smart Diabetes testbed that includes smart clothing, smartphone, and big data clouds. The experimental results show that our system can effectively provide personalized diagnosis and treatment suggestions to patients.",

Network slicing has emerged as the most promising approach to address this challenge by enabling per-slice management of virtualized resources. We aim to bring the network slicing paradigm into mobile transport networks by provisioning and managing slices tailored to the needs of different vertical industries. Our technical approach is twofold: (i) enabling vertical industries to meet their service requirements within customized slices; and (ii) aggregating and federating transport networking and computing fabric, from the edge up to the core and cloud, to create and manage slices throughout a federated virtualized infrastructure. The main focus of the article is on major technical highlights of vertical-oriented slicing mechanisms for 5G mobile networks.",

      "abstract": "The SK Telecom Company of South Korea recently introduced the concept of IoST to its business model. The company deployed IoST, which constantly generates data via the LoRa wireless platform. The increase in data rates generated by IoST is escalating exponentially. After attempting to analyze and store the massive volume of IoST data using existing tools and technologies, the South Korean company realized the shortcomings immediately. The current article addresses some of the issues and presents a big data analytics architecture for its IoST. A system developed using the proposed architecture will be able to analyze and store IoST data efficiently while enabling better decisions. The proposed architecture is composed of four layers, namely the small things layer, infrastructure layer, platform layer, and application layer. Finally, a detailed analysis of a big data implementation of the IoST used to track humidity and temperature via Hadoop is presented as a proof of concept.",

In this article, a TDC with ~40 ps measurement resolution and very large linear dynamic range is proposed for optical sensing applications. Referenced to a single 100 MHz clock, the TDC incorporates a DLL and a VDL loop to automatically stabilize the measuring resolution, thus eliminating the need for a separate calibration step before or during actual measurements. The proposed TDC is fabricated using CMOS 0.18 m technology, and its designed characteristics are validated through experiments.",

      "abstract": "Both massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and use of frequencies in the range 24-100 GHz are considered essential for upcoming 5G systems. Measurements of the new type of channels are needed, but this is challenging due to the large number of channels in massive MIMO and the short wavelength in the 24-100 GHz channels (so-called mmWave channels). This article describes a sounder system capable of measurements in both types of channels. While the same sounder system supports simultaneous massive MIMO and mmWave channels, the number of channels in each band and in total is in practice limited. For massive MIMO in the 300-6000 MHz band alone, arrays with up to 128 receiver (Rx) elements are possible, receiving from 16 independent mobile transmitter (Tx) antennas, where all channels are measured within 1.3 ms and in a 200 MHz bandwidth. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first sounding system with this number of channels and a speed necessary for measuring the dynamic channels in typical application scenarios. For mmWave channels, the sounder operates in the range 18-40 GHz. For these bands up to 2 Tx elements and 16 Rx elements can be measured. In addition, the article describes some measurements in both a massive MIMO setup in an indoor sports arena and an mmWave setup with a handheld device containing a 7-element array.",

However, the endto- end delay is large in store-carry-and-forwardbased vehicular networks, which has become the main obstacle for the implementation of large-scale SIoV. With the extensive applications of mobile devices, crowdsensing is promising to enable realtime content dissemination in a city-wide traffic management system. This article first provides an overview of several promising research areas for traffic management in SIoV. Given the significance of traffic management in urban areas, we investigate a crowdsensing-based framework to provide timely response for traffic management in heterogeneous SIoV. The participant vehicles based on D2D communications integrate trajectory and topology information to dynamically regulate their social behaviors according to network conditions. A real-world taxi trajectory analysis-based performance evaluation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed framework. Furthermore, we discuss several future.",

      "abstract": "Smart communities are an emerging communication paradigm that mobilizes physical devices operating in different wireless networks to deliver ubiquitous services. Since wireless communication is vulnerable to physical or link layer jamming, it is essential to map the locations and shapes of jammed regions for adjusting routing policy. However, existing mapping strategies require jammed devices to override the carrier sense multiple access limitation for the declaration of jamming. Besides, the utilization of flat network architectures in existing mapping strategies incurs large communication overhead. In this article, a three-layer hierarchical network structure and a matching top-down mapping mechanism are proposed. Through organizing smart nodes into one-hop clusters, the jamming phenomenon can be discovered purely from cluster heads' data reports collected in the sink layer. Each one-hop cluster is also used as a basic mapping unit to identify and measure jammed regions. From cluster-level mapping to sensor-level mapping, jammed areas can be mapped from coarse- to fine-grained. Simulation results demonstrate that the mapping traffic involved in the proposed jammed-area mapping strategy can be reduced substantially.",

      "abstract": "To cope with the tremendous growth in mobile data traffic, ultra-dense networks (UDNs) will be deployed in the future cellular network. Meanwhile, the enormous amount of available spectrum in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands can be also exploited to increase the wireless link capacity. In accordance with these trends, this article introduces a novel hierarchical software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to facilitate the deployment of UDNs with both microwave base stations and mmWave access points. Aimed at reducing the cost of computational complexity and signaling overhead, the novel SDN architecture employs a semi-distributed design approach by configuring two levels of controllers: the centralized superior SDN controller and the localized subordinate SDN controller. Some practical challenges posed by the characteristics of mmWave transmissions, such as high propagation loss, channel blockage, and directional beamforming, are also discussed. To deal with such challenges, we then propose several important network operations for the hierarchical SDN, including dynamic subordinate SDN management, mobility management, and user-centric design. We finally provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposals.",

A holistic approach to synthesize the growing volume of research on e-health standards with a broader analysis of common themes is needed. Yet an assessment of the state of academic research that involves standards and e-health across disciplines has not been taken up to date. To understand the dynamics of e-health standards, this article systematically reviews the standards landscape in e-health research. We found three key themes: first, the use and harmonization of e-health standards; second, the types and roles of e-health standards; and third, the adoption of standards.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the smart city concept, which involves multiple disciplines, for example, smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community, has become popular because of its ability to improve urban citizens' quality of life. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require seamless real-time access, sharing, storing, processing, and analysis anywhere at any time for intelligent decision making to improve living standards. In this scenario, MCC can play a vital role by allowing a mobile device to access and offload big-data-related tasks to powerful cloudlet servers attached to many wireless APs, thus ensuring that the QoS demands of end users are met. However, the connectivity of mobile devices with a given AP is not continuous, but rather sporadic with varying signal strengths. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the cloudlet resources and the big data application requests place additional challenges in making optimal code execution decision. To cope with this problem, this article proposes a mobility- aware optimal resource allocation architecture, namely Mobi-Het, for remote big data task execution in MCC that offers higher efficiency in timeliness and reliability. The system architecture and key components of the proposed resource allocation service are presented and evaluated. The results of experiments and simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed Mobi-Het architecture for mobile big data applications.",

Existing work has widely studied spectral and energy efficiency in such networks and shown that high spectral and energy efficiency can be achieved. This article investigates the benefits of heterogeneous ultra-dense network architecture from the perspectives of three promising technologies, physical layer security, caching, and wireless energy harvesting, and provides an enthusiastic outlook toward application of these technologies in heterogeneous ultra-dense networks. Based on the rationale of each technology, opportunities and challenges are identified to advance the research in this emerging network.",

      "abstract": "Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal absorption, as well as reflections, refractions, and diffractions caused by physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for and are treated as probabilistic factors. This article proposes a radically different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the behavior of wireless environments. The key enabler is the so-called HyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials that can interact with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering toward any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation, and more. Multiple tiles are employed to coat objects such as walls, furniture, and overall, any objects in indoor and outdoor environments. An external software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile to best fit the needs of communicating devices. Evaluation via simulations highlights the potential of the new concept.",

      "abstract": "In order to improve communication efficiency, applying THz communication to MHNs is envisioned as a promising approach. However, the security of THz MHNs is rarely discussed and urgently needs attention. For the purpose of effectively resolving the exposed security issues in THz MHNs, in this article, an intelligent spectrum control strategy in a THz network is proposed, and an intelligent spectrum control sequence is generated, which has the characteristics of adaptive frequency slot number, wide gap, and orthogonality. Extensive theoretical analyses prove that this sequence outperforms the sequences available in uniformity, randomness, and Hamming correlation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy has great anti-attack capability and high throughput, and that the BER of THz communication with the proposed strategy can be increased two orders of magnitude in a complex electromagnetic environment. By using the proposed strategy, the security and reliability of future THz MHNs can be ensured.",

Although NDN was designed to natively tackle security issues inherent to IP networks, it also introduces new security threats that may prevent its practical deployment by telco operators. Therefore, designing and implementing a dedicated security monitoring plane is essential to enable such future deployment. In this article, we present a set of contributions in this area. It first consists of featuring significant NDN attacks in a real operating context to evaluate their actual impact. Then, by analyzing the NFD data plane pipelines, we present a monitoring plane design that captures the state of NDN nodes by instrumenting 18 metrics with dedicated probes. We then correlate these metrics with a Bayesian network, which allows the detection of potential abnormal behaviors.

      "abstract": "Smart homes have attracted much attention due to the expanding of IoT and smart devices. In this article, we propose a smart gateway platform for data collection and awareness in smart home networks. A smart gateway will replace the traditional network gateway to connect the home network and the Internet. A smart home network supports different types of smart devices, including in-home IoT devices, smartphones, smart electric appliances, and so on. A traditional network gateway is not capable of providing quality of service measurement, user behavioral analytics, or network optimization. Such tasks are traditionally performed with measurement agents such as optical splitters or network probes deployed in the core network. Our proposed platform is a lightweight plug-in for the smart gateway to accomplish data collection, awareness, and reporting. While the smart gateway is able to adjust the control policy for data collection and awareness locally, a cloud-based controller is also included for more refined control policy updates. Furthermore, we propose a multi-dimensional awareness plug-in framework to achieve accurate data awareness at the smart gateway. The efficiency of data collection and accuracy of data awareness of the proposed platform is demonstrated based on tests using actual data traffic from a large number of smart home users.",

Thanks to its unlicensed and large bandwidth, VLC can deliver high throughput, better energy efficiency, and low-cost data communications. In this article, a hybrid RF/VLC architecture is considered that can simultaneously provide lighting and communication coverage across a room. The considered architecture involves a novel multi-element hemispherical bulb design, which can transmit multiple data streams over LED modules. Simulations considering various VLC transmitter configurations and topologies show that good link quality and high spatial reuse can be maintained in typical indoor communication scenarios.",

In order to realize real-time, efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly management for resources, and ultimately promote the green production transformation, every enterprise needs to ponder the process of modern industry development. Based on the Industrial Internet of Things, this article discusses the green development mode of the food industry, and uses the entropy method to measure the environmental pollution index of China's food industry. Considering the issue of environmental pollution and energy consumption, the article uses the DEA-Malmquist method to measure the green total factor productivity of all types of China's food industry from 2006 to 2014. The results show that the environmental pollution index of China's food industry shows a rise -- fall -- rise trend from 2006 to 2014. The green total factor productivity of Chinese food industry shows a rising trend from 2006 to 2014. The average technical efficiency of China's food industry is low, but the technical efficiency shows a rising trend. The technical efficiency of the agricultural food processing industry remains effective.",

Densely deployed small cell architecture faces several major challenges, including low infrastructure utilization ratio, severe inter-cell interference, and so on. In this article, we aim to develop a novel super base station (SupBS) network architecture to tackle these issues. The proposed SupBS architecture consists of two layers, namely, an infrastructure layer and a virtualized network layer. In the infrastructure layer, there are three key physical components: the hybrid heterogeneous radio unit pool, line interface switch unit, and computing resources pool. In the virtualized network layer, there are two logical modules designed on top of the three physical components, namely, the virtualized base station and virtualized software defined core network. The two logical modules are designed to facilitate the use of the underlying three physical components by reducing the energy consumption and processing delay. We present the functionalities of the two virtualized modules and explain how they are utilized to create virtual networks. Moreover, we demonstrate a recently developed SupBS prototype, and provide an application scenario for this prototype in an Internet information broadcast-storage system to show the advantages of our architecture.",

      "abstract": "5G networks aim to support a number of vertical industries that are characterized by diverse performance requirements. Network slicing is considered to be the key enabler to enhance cellular networks with the desired flexibility to achieve this target. During the past years, the network slicing concept has been thoroughly studied, and the main operational principles have been established. However, the added complexity introduced by network slicing creates some issues that are still under investigation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of solutions proposed by the research community and, more importantly, the latest status of the 3GPP standardization process. This survey covers solutions for all network domains (i.e., access, transport, and core) as well the management of network slices. The article also identifies key topics that need to be further addressed during the following years.",

      "abstract": "Cluster computing applications, such as MapReduce and Spark, have been widely deployed in data centers to support commercial applications and scientific research. These applications often involve a collection of parallel flows generated by two groups of machines, and the slowest flow will determine the completion of applications. However, existing network-level optimizations are agnostic to the special communication pattern of the applications. Most of them only focus on improving the completion time of an individual flow instead of a collection of parallel flows. The recently proposed coflow abstraction exactly expresses the requirements of cluster computing applications and creates new opportunities to reduce the completion time of jobs in cluster computing. Due to the wide variations in coflow characteristics, coflow scheduling faces great challenges in data center networks. Much work has been proposed to solve one or some of the various challenges. Therefore, in this article, we survey the latest development in coflow scheduling for data center networks. We hope that this article will help readers quickly understand the causes of each problem and learn about current research progress, so as to serve as a guide and motivation toward further research in this area.",

While fog computing offers numerous benefits, it also faces various security challenges, of which access control is one of the fundamental requirements since it is concerned with authorizing users to access resources in the open fog environment. This article provides a comprehensive survey of access control of users' data in the environment of fog computing with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It discusses the definition, architecture, and characteristics of fog computing, based on which typical requirements and essential models of access control are addressed. Finally, it highlights known access control schemes in the environment of fog computing, and identifies existing unresolved problems as future directions.",

ACTN is a scalable, hierarchical architecture enabling practical multi-domain, multi-layer, and multi-vendor transport network control integration through the use of standard YANG models defining controller northbound interfaces. A large variety of carrier use cases and required control functionality was shown to be enabled strictly through use of these standard models, as implemented independently by two participating vendors and operated in a Tier One carrier lab environment. The demonstrated use cases are discussed in detail, and other use cases, for which ACTN and the IETF YANG models are thought to be well-suited -- notably including IP + Optical control cases -- are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Spectrum is of increasing value. This article discusses two new and emerging standards, VITA 49.2 and IEEE 1900.5.2, and identifies both as abstract descriptions of spectrum. VITA 49 emerged as a packet-based protocol at the RF-digital interface of software-defined radios. The VITA 49 metadata allows all information about the spectrum as seen by a radio at its antenna to be described, stored, and transported to other systems. IEEE 1900.5.2 arose out of ongoing efforts to create a policy language for cognitive radios and in response to the need to describe spectrum usage. This article shows how the IEEE 1900.5.2 Spectrum Consumption Model can be cast as a VITA 49.2 packet. It also identifies next steps for standardization in this area.",

      "abstract": "The flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a new paradigm of wireless communication that governs the autonomous movement of UAVs and supports UAV-to-UAV communication. A FANET can provide an effective real-time communication solution for the multiple UAV systems considering each flying UAV as a router. However, existing mobile ad hoc protocols cannot meet the needs of FANETs due to high-speed mobility and frequent topology change. In addition, the complicated flight environment and varied flight tasks lead to the traditional built-in-rules protocols no longer meeting the demands of autonomy. Hence, we have proposed adaptive hybrid communication protocols including a novel position-prediction-based directional MAC protocol (PPMAC) and a self-learning routing protocol based on reinforcement learning (RLSRP). The performance results show that the proposed PPMAC overcomes the directional deafness problem with directional antennas, and RLSRP provides an automatically evolving and more effective routing scheme. Our proposed hybrid adaptive communication protocols have the potential to provide an intelligent and highly autonomous communication solution for FANETs, and indicate the main research orientation of FANET protocols.",

      "abstract": "The next generation communication networks are going to be composed of virtualized node and link resources, which can be divided into various slices. Different virtual network slices can be configured with different amounts of resources so that each slice can be able to optimally satisfy the quality of service requirements of the given category of Internet of Things services. Virtualized resource allocated to slices can be dynamically adjusted to adapt the network capability to varying workload. In this article, we present our ongoing research on autonomous mechanisms for the intelligent allocation and dynamic adjustment of resources to make the virtualized network system scalable while optimally utilizing the resources. We present mechanisms for achieving three types of scalability: vertical scaling by adjusting virtualized resources allocated to a network function within a node, horizontal scaling by adjusting the number of virtualized network nodes and servers, and internetwork scaling by the arbitration of limited resources among many network slices. The preliminary performance evaluation results are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The IoT extends the idea of interconnecting computers to a plethora of different devices, collectively referred to as smart devices. These are physical items, that is, \"things\", such as wearable devices, home appliances, and vehicles, enriched with computational and networking capabilities. Due to the huge set of devices involved, and therefore its pervasiveness, IoT is a great platform to leverage for building new applications and services or extending existing ones. In this regard, expanding online advertising into the IoT realm is an under-investigated yet promising research direction, especially considering that the traditional Internet advertising market is already worth hundreds of billions of dollars. In this article, we first propose the architecture of an IoT advertising platform inspired by the well known business ecosystem, which the traditional Internet advertising is based on. Additionally, we discuss the key challenges to implement such a platform, with a special focus on issues related to architecture, advertisement content delivery, security, and privacy of the users.",

      "abstract": "The next generation of mobile systems, 5G, will be the communication standard that accommodates the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to support many applications in providing 5G connectivity to the IoT, by extending highspeed connectivity from the sky to objects on the ground, or even by carrying onboard some IoT devices. However, given their critical nature, the management of UAVs induces high exchange of control messages with the ground control station, resulting in the crowded spectrum used by cellular networks. The authors raise the problem of degrading the network spectrum with UAVs' management messages, and discuss the need for an efficient orchestration system. In this article, they propose a novel scheme, dubbed the aerial control system, which is based on separating the data plane from the control plane of UAVs, and pushing the latter to be performed in the air by UAVs. The solution provides an orchestration logic that takes advantage of the autonomous nature of UAVs to organize UAVs in one or several clusters. UAV-to-UAV communication enables spectrum reuse and avoids crowding the network with management messages, while dedicating more 5G spectrum for ensuring more bandwidth to the IoT through UAV-to-infrastructure communication.",

      "abstract": "Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), an emerging class of aerial drones, are fast turning into a high value mobile sensing platform for applications across sectors ranging from industrial to humanitarian. While MAVs have a large sensory gamut at their disposal; vision continues to dominate the external sensing scene, which has limited usability in scenarios that offer non-visual clues such as auditory. Therefore, we endeavor to provision a MAV auditory system (i.e., ears); and as part of this goal, our preliminary aim is to develop a robust acoustic localization system for detecting sound sources in the physical space of interest. However, devising this capability is extremely challenging due to strong ego-noise from the MAV propeller units, which is both wideband and non-stationary. It is well known that beamformers with large sensor arrays can overcome high noise levels; but in an attempt to cater to the platform (i.e., space, payload, and computation) constraints of a MAV, we propose DroneEARS: a binaural sensing system for geo-locating sound sources. It combines the benefits of sparse (two elements) sensor array design (for meeting the platform constraints), and our proposed mobility induced beamforming based on intra-band and inter-measurement beam fusion (for overcoming the severe ego-noise and its other complex characteristics) to significantly enhance the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate the efficacy of DroneEARS, in terms of SNR improvement obtained over many widely used techniques, by empirical evaluations.",

An E2E perspective is given, including the enhanced QoS architecture that comes with 5G, and the large number of scheduling related options from the new access stratum sub-layer, MAC, and PHY layer. A survey of the 5G design agreements from the recently concluded 5G Study in 3GPP is presented, and it is explained how to best utilize all these new degrees of freedom to arrive at an agile scheduling design that offers superior E2E performance for a variety of services with highly diverse QoS requirements. Enhancements to ensure efficient implementation of the 5G scheduler for different network architectures are outlined. Finally, state-of-the-art system level performance results are presented, showing the ability to efficiently multiplex services with highly diverse QoS requirements.",

      "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables delay-sensitive computing tasks to be executed at network edges, has been proposed to accommodate the explosive growth of the Internet of Things. However, the growing demands for massive connectivity, ultra-low latency, and high reliability in various emerging resource-hungry and computation-intensive applications pose new challenges in network access capacity. This motivates us to conceive a new MEC framework from an air-ground integration perspective. First, we present a review of the state-of-the-art literature. Then the architecture and technological benefits of the proposed framework are elaborated. Next, four typical use cases are introduced, and a case study is conducted to demonstrate the significant performance improvements in computation capability and communication connectivity based on real-world road topology. Finally, we present challenges and research directions, and conclude this article.",

However, the deployment of amateur drones poses various safety, security, and privacy threats. To cope with these challenges, amateur drone surveillance has become a very important but largely unexplored topic. In this article, we first present a brief survey to show the state-of-the-art studies on amateur drone surveillance. Then we propose a vision, named Dragnet, tailoring the recently emerging Cognitive Internet of Things framework for amateur drone surveillance. Next, we discuss the key enabling techniques for Dragnet in detail, accompanied by the technical challenges and open issues. Furthermore, we provide an exemplary case study on the detection and classification of authorized and unauthorized amateur drones, where, for example, an important event is being held and only authorized drones are allowed to fly over.",

MEC is aimed at enabling such capabilities on connected devices, whereas CDSs have been proposed recently as a promising path for addressing such tasks, and to enable truly distributed intelligence in the mobile and IoT environment. As an example of these demanding IoT scenarios, the mobility understanding of individuals could provide decisive information toward city planning, crowd studies, mHealth, and so on. However, efficient implementations are a titanic challenge due to energy limitations on mobile devices. Under cognitive computing, we intend to provide mobile devices with the ability for online recognition of user mobility changes and for learning ways to adapt to those changes for different purposes, including energy savings in sensing. We present a fully autonomous on-device implementation of a CDS inspired framework that learns and exploits an expanded spatio-temporal model from stay points detection for human mobility understanding. Experimental results show benefits in both mobility mining and energy savings, showing the potential of using embeddable CDSs for future cognitive IoT-oriented applications.",

NDN changes the network communication model from the delivery of packets to hosts identified by IP addresses to the retrieval of named and secured data packets. Consequently, NDN also fundamentally changes the approaches to network security. Making named data the centerpiece of the architecture leads to a new security framework that secures data directly, and uses name semantics to enable applications to reason about security and to automate the use of cryptographic keys. In this article, we introduce NDN's approaches to security bootstrapping, data authenticity, confidentiality, and availability.",

      "abstract": "Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are an expansion of the Internet of Things paradigm that fully exploits the collective intelligence of smart nodes in industrial processes. The data acquisition of IWSNs in harsh industrial environments is susceptible to transmission failures and time delay while being strict in the performance of reliability and timeliness. This article proposes an SNR-assured anti-jamming clustering routing (SA-AJCR) protocol to address the problem of data transmission in an environment of high ambient noise and complex electromagnetic interference. To ease the influence of the industrial field on wireless communication, the irregular radio range of each node is modeled through field testing, and then its communication range is artificially constrained to ensure that each signal is received under a satisfying SNR. Through mapping out an approximation of jammed areas at the cluster level, SA-AJCR enables IWSNs to be tolerant of node or link failure caused by jamming. Routing paths can be adjusted to greedily bypass the mapped jammed regions in the network without interrupting the data transmission or overriding the CSMA limitation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effectively able to provide high packet delivery ratio in hostile electromagnetic environments with the existence of jammers.",

      "abstract": "If we assume line-of-sight propagation and perfect channel state information at the base station -- consistent with slow moving terminals -- then a direct performance comparison between Massive MIMO at PCS and mmWave frequency bands is straightforward and highly illuminating. Line-of-sight propagation is considered favorable for mmWave because of minimal attenuation and its facilitation of hybrid beamforming to reduce the required number of active transceivers. We quantify the number of mmWave (60 GHz) service antennas that are needed to duplicate the performance of a specified number of PCS (1.9 GHz) service antennas. As a baseline we consider a modest PCS deployment of 128 antennas serving 18 terminals. At one extreme, we find that, to achieve the same per-terminal maxmin 95 percent-likely downlink throughput in a single-cell system, 20,000 mmWave antennas are needed. To match the total antenna area of the PCS array would require 128,000 half-wavelength mmWave antennas, but a much reduced number is adequate because the large number of antennas also confers greater channel orthogonality. At the other extreme, in a highly interference-limited multi-cell environment, only 215 mmWave antennas are needed; in this case, increasing the transmitted power yields little improvement in service quality.",

Due to the low price and ease of use, drones have been widely utilized in many application scenarios, which potentially pose great threats to public security and personal privacy. To mitigate these threats, it is necessary to deploy anti-drone systems in sensitive areas to detect, localize, and defend against the intruding drones. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the technologies utilized for drone surveillance and the existing anti-drone systems. Then we develop an anti-drone system at Zhejiang University, named ADS-ZJU, which combines multiple passive surveillance technologies to realize drone detection, localization, and radio frequency jamming. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and open research issues in such a system.",

      "abstract": "Predicting failures on networks and systems is critical in order to maintain high uptime rates. Online failure prediction (OFP) techniques use machine learning and predictive analytics to generate failure models that can be applied to computer network data. These techniques can be provisioned on state-of-the-art stream processing systems, such as Spark Streaming, in order to cope with the scalability challenges from the base data. A big challenge with OFP is selecting the right information to process, as well as the appropriate features in order to achieve high accuracy in predicting failures on complex, interconnected systems. In this article we describe an OFP system built over Apache Spark that takes a repository of network management events, trains a Random Forest model, and uses this model to predict the appearance of future events in near real time. We show through our experiments the usefulness of network management events for accurate predictions, and the advantages of the proposed system in terms of predictive quality, cost, and ease of deployment.",

      "abstract": "The Internet provides a growing variety of social data sources: calendars, event aggregators, social networks, browsers, and so on. Also, the mechanisms to gather information from these sources, such as web services, semantic web, and big data techniques, have become more accessible and efficient. This allows detailed prediction of major expected events and their associated crowds. Due to the increasing requirements for service provision, particularly in urban areas, having information on those events would be extremely useful for operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) tasks, since the social events largely affect the cellular network performance. Therefore, this article presents a framework for the automatic acquisition and processing of social data, as well as their association with network elements (NEs) and their performance. The main functionalities of this system, which have been devised to directly work in real networks, are defined and developed. Different OAM applications of the proposed approach are analyzed, and the system is evaluated in a real deployment.",

      "abstract": "Blockchains are known to provide verifiable tamper-resistant trails of accepted transactions. This guarantee comes at the considerable cost of storage and computational power, thereby restricting its application. Current research has focused on alternatives such as proof of reputation, proof of stake, and proof of elapsed-time to reduce the computational burden on the blockchain participants. Orthogonal to this effort, we focus on a specific set of applications that cannot commit much storage space and computational resources, but require only reasonable guarantees on the validity of transactions. To this end, we introduce blockchain design alternatives, collectively called ApproxBC, that can provide proof of transactions with provable confidence bounds. Consequently, ApproxBC can considerably reduce the computation and storage resources required, making them suitable for resource-constrained Internet of Things environments. We also showcase two approximation-tolerant applications that can leverage the quicker computation and smaller storage requirements.",

This article covers scaled CMOS circuit and system tradeoffs for large mmWave power consumers including the PA, LO generation, and LO distribution, in the context of mobile link requirements and beamforming system architectures. We survey a selection of published mmWave transceivers relevant to 5G communications and provide insight into tradeoffs made in practice.

      "abstract": "Next-generation systems are anticipated to be digital platforms supporting innovative services with rapidly changing traffic patterns. To cope with this dynamicity in a cost-efficient manner, operators need advanced service management capabilities such as those provided by NFV. NFV enables operators to scale network services with higher granularity and agility than today. To this end, automation is key. In search of this automation, ETSI has defined a reference NFV framework that makes use of model-driven templates called NSDs to operate network services. For the scaling operation, an NSD defines a discrete set of instantiation levels among which a network service instance can be resized throughout its life cycle. Thus, the design of these levels is key for ensuring effective scaling. In this article, we provide an overview of the automation of the network service scaling operation in NFV, addressing the options and boundaries introduced by ETSI normative specifications. We start by providing a description of the NSD structure, focusing on how instantiation levels are constructed. For illustrative purposes, we propose an NSD for a representative network service. This NSD includes different instantiation levels that enable different ways to automatically scale this network service. Then we show the different scaling procedures the NFV framework has available, and how it may automate their triggering. Finally, we propose an ETSI-compliant workflow to describe in detail a representative scaling procedure. This workflow clarifies the interactions and information exchanges between the functional blocks in the NFV framework when performing the scaling operation.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing is essential to support future emerging multimedia-rich and delay-sensitive applications in vehicular networks. However, the massive deployment of edge computing infrastructures induces new problems including energy consumption and carbon pollution. This motivates us to develop BEGIN (Big data enabled EnerGy-efficient vehIcular edge computiNg), a programmable, scalable, and flexible framework for integrating big data analytics with vehicular edge computing. In this article, we first present a comprehensive literature review. Then the overall design principle of BEGIN is described with an emphasis on computing domain and data domain convergence. In the next section, we classify big data in BEGIN into four categories and then describe their features and potential values. Four typical application scenarios in BEGIN including node deployment, resource adaptation and workload allocation, energy management, and proactive caching and pushing, are provided to illustrate how to achieve energy-efficient vehicular edge computing by using big data. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of BEGIN and the superiority of big data in energy efficiency improvement. Finally, we conclude this work and outline future research open issues.",

In these challenging scenarios, dynamic radio connectivity at high frequencies, augmented with timely positioning-related information, becomes instrumental to improve communication performance and facilitate efficient computation offloading. Our work reviews the main research challenges and reveals open implementation gaps in IIoT applications that rely on location awareness and multi-connectivity in super high and extremely high frequency bands. It further conducts a rigorous numerical investigation to confirm the potential of precise device localization in the emerging IIoT systems. We focus on positioning- aided benefits made available to multi-connectivity IIoT device operation at 28 GHz, which notably improve data transfer rates, communication latency, and the extent of control overhead.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a network architecture for the next generation of MHNs, where mmW, terahertz, and conventional mW bands coexist, with cost-benefit trade-offs of each type of link. We envision a radically different communication paradigm and outline a MAC protocol design that switches among the aforementioned bands for data transmissions, falling back on the slower link each time for the reverse channel ACKs. The use of the higher-capacity link in the forward direction for data communication and the slower reverse channel for the returning ACKs allows for uninterrupted unidirectional communication and efficient use of the channel. The article discusses the challenges in analyzing and parameter setting for the various features of the protocol, and identifies candidate solutions. A performance evaluation of the approach is undertaken using a realistic scenario of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication enabling data center traffic backhauling. This performance shows that by adopting the proposed MAC protocol data transfer of around 100 Terabits, it is possible for typical vehicle-to-infrastructure contact times.",

      "abstract": "The unprecedented proliferation of miniaturized sensors and intelligent communication, computing, and control technologies have paved the way for the development of the Industrial Internet of Things. The IIoT incorporates machine learning and massively parallel distributed systems such as clouds, clusters, and grids for big data storage, processing, and analytics. In IIoT, end devices continuously generate and transmit data streams, resulting in increased network traffic between device-cloud communication. Moreover, it increases in-network data transmissions. requiring additional efforts for big data processing, management, and analytics. To cope with these engendered issues, this article first introduces a novel concentric computing model (CCM) paradigm composed of sensing systems, outer and inner gateway processors, and central processors (outer and inner) for the deployment of big data analytics applications in IIoT. Second, we investigate, highlight, and report recent research efforts directed at the IIoT paradigm with respect to big data analytics. Third, we identify and discuss indispensable challenges that remain to be addressed for employing CCM in the IIoT paradigm. Lastly, we provide several future research directions (e.g., real-time data analytics, data integration, transmission of meaningful data, edge analytics, real-time fusion of streaming data, and security and privacy).",

      "abstract": "With the popularity of smart devices, multi-access edge computing (MEC) has become the mainstream of dealing with big data in heterogeneous Internet of Things (H-IoT). MEC makes full use of the computing power of edge nodes, which greatly reduces the computing pressure of data centers, and brings great convenience to the storage and processing of big data. However, it is easy to become the object of hacker attacks due to the lack of centralized management of distributed nodes. Once these nodes are compromised, a series of privacy issues can happen. In this article, we first overview the architecture of MEC for H-IoT. The MEC covers three-level advanced functional entities, including moblie edge (ME) system-level, ME host-level and ME network- level. Second, we draw our attention to the privacy issues in the MEC, especially in data aggregation and data mining. In addition, we consider machine learning privacy preserving as a case study in the application of MEC. Simulation results are shown to reveal the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, we propose open issues for future work.",

      "abstract": "Critical infrastructure monitoring is one of the most important applications of a smart city. The objective is to monitor the integrity of the structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) and detect and pinpoint the locations of possible events (e.g., damages, cracks). Regarding today's complex structures, collecting data using wireless sensor data over extensive vertical lengths creates enormous challenges. With a direct BS deployment, a big amount of data will accumulate to be relayed to the BS. As a result, traditional models and schemes developed for health monitoring are largely challenged by low-cost, quality-guaranteed, and real-time event monitoring. In this article, we propose BigReduce, a cloud based health monitoring application with an IoT framework that could cover most of the key infrastructures of a smart city under an umbrella and provide event monitoring. To reduce the burden of big data processing at the BS and enhance the quality of event detection, we integrate real-time data processing and intelligent decision making capabilities with BigReduce. Particularly, we provide two innovative schemes for health event monitoring so that an IoT sensor can use them locally; one is a big data reduction scheme, and the other is a decision making scheme. We believe that BigReduce will result in a remarkable performance in terms of data reduction, energy cost reduction, and the quality of monitoring.",

We argue that efficient management of IoT systems in smart communities and cities lies not in sensing systems alone, but in the expedited funneling and processing of data as we attempt to prune the unnecessary and build on the valuable. The quest for energy efficiency that dominated sensor networks for so long is now matched with a more pressing demand for access ubiquity and real-time operation. We highlight how big data became a challenge in sensing systems, then elaborate on the status quo in managing this challenge under different research umbrellas. We draw upon three planes that encompass current and future developments for the management of big sensed data (BSD), namely resources, data, and information planes, detailing their pertinent challenges and how evolving solutions can streamline their contributions in light of others. We conclude by highlighting core challenges rising across these three planes, and potential solutions to addressing synergy in coping and scaling with BSD.",

      "abstract": "Most marine mammals, such as sperm whales and long-finned pilot whales, always produce call pulses with certain characteristics for echolocation, communication, and so on. Generally, the enemy's underwater reconnaissance system almost always classifies these biological signals as ocean noise and then filters them out. Based on this fact, this article provides our attempts at a novel steganography to conceal digital communications in the constructed communication frame composed of original marine mammal call pulses. We first put forward a screening scheme to pick out high-quality call pulses from the original marine mammal call pulses. Next, we discuss how to design a secure, camouflaged, and covert communication frame according to the characteristics of marine mammal call pulses. Both the time delay difference among communication codes and the number of communication codes are simultaneously used to convey the digital information. The ambiguity function and correlation technique are utilized to select communication codes from original whale call pulses. In the end, experiments were performed to demonstrate the validity and security of the bio-inspired steganography. The presented bio-inspired steganography is able to serve a variety of underwater military communications, such as submarine communications and autonomous underwater vehicle communications.",

      "abstract": "Today's vehicles are becoming cyber-physical systems that not only communicate with other vehicles but also gather various information from hundreds of sensors within them. These developments help create smart and connected (e.g., self-driving) vehicles that will introduce significant information to drivers, manufacturers, insurance companies, and maintenance service providers for various applications. One such application that is becoming crucial with the introduction of self-driving cars is forensic analysis of traffic accidents. The utilization of vehicle-related data can be instrumental in post-accident scenarios to discover the faulty party, particularly for self-driving vehicles. With the opportunity of being able to access various information in cars, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework among the various elements involved to manage the collected vehicle-related data. Specifically, we first integrate vehicular public key infrastructure (VPKI) to the proposed blockchain to provide membership establishment and privacy. Next, we design a fragmented ledger that will store detailed data related to vehicles such as maintenance information/ history, car diagnosis reports, and so on. The proposed forensic framework enables trustless, traceable, and privacy-aware post-accident analysis with minimal storage and processing overhead.",

As a potential approach to tackle upcoming requirements providing basic primitives to encompass analytics, automation, and distributed orchestration, we investigate blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) in the context of operational phases in support of multi-administrative domain networking. We present and discuss a generalized framework for multi-domain service orchestration using blockchain-based DApps and then showcase proof-of-concept prototype experiments based on best of breed open source components that demonstrate DApp functionalities as candidate enablers of multi-domain network services. We then analyze three use case scenarios pursued by ongoing work at standards development organizations, namely MEF, 3GPP, and ETSI NFV, discussing standardization opportunities around blockchain-based DApps.",

In this article, we survey three of these solutions, namely Golem, iExec, and SONM, compare them, and identify some of the problems they leave unsolved. Moreover, we consider existing standards for the development of interoperable decentralized cloud solutions that would allow such systems to compete with large providers and would prevent vendor lock-in. We believe that our study contributes to the evolution of cloud systems not only by pointing out incompatibilities among projects and possible solutions for research problems in the area, but also by reviewing the existing standards and suggesting new standardization opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the spectrum band beyond 60 GHz has attracted attention with the growth of traffic demand. Previous studies assumed that these bands are not suitable for vehicle communications due to the short range and high rate of blockage. However, it also means that there is no existing service or regulation designed for these bands, which makes this area free to apply. Therefore, in this article, we draw a potential map of THz vehicle transmission for autonomous vehicles to break the blockage of short-range and unstable links. First, we give a brief overview of possible waveforms followed by the specific channel at 0.1-1 THz. Then we propose an autonomous relay algorithm called ATLR for the gigabit-level communication in the high-speed road environment. Finally, we discuss how the THz transmission helps relieve the interference problem and provide extra data to support various instructions in autonomous vehicles.",

The challenges of high density deployments can be addressed by network-wide centralized control. To this end, we propose CADWAN, a Control Architecture for efficient management of Dense WiFi Access Networks.

Furthermore, CADWAN is complementary to ongoing developments in IEEE 802.11, especially 802.11ax.",

      "abstract": "With the boost of IoT, WSNs have been a well-liked know-how. However, due to WSNs' open and unmonitored nature, security vulnerabilities pose a significant problem. In this article, aiming at SLP, a major security problem, we propose the CASLP protection scheme in WSNs for IoT. To increase the scope of the transmitting path, the source starts the random walk in a given direction. Then, to maintain CASLP convergence, nodes only select their next relay nodes in a specific range. Last, to further improve SLP, we concatenate arcs from several rings around the sink to form a new closed loop. Compared to a ringbased routing scheme, CASLP can reduce delays and energy consumption at the minor expense of safety time in WSNs.",

      "abstract": "The use of fiber optic cable in support of bandwidth expansion has become de rigeur. Not only does optical fiber offer tremendous bandwidth, it is also low in attenuation, small in cross section, inexpensive, and impervious to electromagnetic interference, and there are significant economies of scale on components developed for the myriad of optical communications markets (long haul, fiber to the home, metro networks, etc.). Shorthaul requirements continue to grow and are expected to exceed the capacity of simple single mode fiber transmission. Spatial multiplexing is a new technique in fiber communications allowing fiber capacity to grow in another dimension by carrying signals on orthogonal modes of light. The short length and high capacity requirements for data center and fronthaul links make them well suited for exploitation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light in spatial multiplexing. We report experiments using commercial transceivers for OOK at 10 Gb/s on three channels (30 Gb/s total on fundamental and two OAM modes), and 10 Gb/s OOK on fundamental and DP-QPSK at 100 Gb/s on two OAM modes. OOK transmission was error free (&lt; 10<sup>-12</sup>), while DP-QPSK had error below 10<sup>-7</sup>.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of wireless services and devices necessitates high bandwidth requirements; however, spectrum resources are not only limited but also heavily underutilized. Multiple license channels that support the same levels of QoS are desirable to resolve the problems posed by the scarcity and inefficient use of spectrum resources in multi-channel cognitive radio networks (MCRNs). One reason is that multimedia services and applications have distinct, stringent QoS requirements. However, due to a lack of coordination between primary and secondary users, identifying the QoS levels supported over available licensed channels has proven to be problematic and has yet to be attempted. This article presents a novel Bayesian non-parametric channel clustering scheme, which identifies the QoS levels supported over available license channels. The proposed scheme employs the infinite Gaussian mixture model and collapsed Gibbs sampler to identify the QoS levels from the feature space of the bit rate, packet delivery ratio, and packet delay variation of licensed channels. Moreover, the real measurements of wireless data traces and comparisons with baseline clustering schemes are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "In the last few years, traffic over wireless networks has been increasing exponentially due to the impact of IoT. IoT is transforming a wide range of services in different domains of urban life, such as environmental monitoring, home automation, and public transportation. The so-called smart city applications will introduce a set of stringent requirements, such as low latency and high mobility, since services must be allocated and instantiated on demand, simultaneously, close to multiple devices at different locations. Efficient resource provisioning functionalities are needed to address these demanding constraints introduced by smart city applications while minimizing resource costs and maximizing QoS. In this article, the CoT framework is presented, which provides not only data collection and analysis functionalities but also automated resource provisioning mechanisms for future smart city applications. CoT is deployed as a smart city testbed in Antwerp, Belgium, which allows researchers and developers to easily set up and validate IoT experiments. A smart city use case of air quality monitoring through the deployment of air quality sensors in moving cars is presented showing the full applicability of the CoT framework for a flexible and scalable resource provisioning in the smart city ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Due to a tremendous increase in mobile traffic, mobile operators have started to restructure their networks to offload their traffic in the unlicensed bands. The 3GPP new technologies of LAA and LTE-U employ an unlicensed radio interface that operates over the 5 GHz unlicensed band to leverage the radio resources for operators' transmissions. 5G relies on spectrum extension using multi-radio interfaces accessing multiple bands such as LAA and LTE-U. However, the physical and MAC layer designs for LTE-based systems have a significant impact on Wi-Fi performance to maintain a fair share of unlicensed spectrum. Therefore, this article proposes a coexistence mechanism that manages backoff for LTE-U and Wi-Fi when accessing the 5 GHz band. The new mechanism allocates certain amounts of packets to both technologies through a new interface that resides in a heterogeneous cloud RAN.",

Channel modeling also benefits in this era, in particular by exploiting algorithmic techniques developed for big data applications. In this article, the challenges and opportunities in clustering-enabled wireless channel modeling are discussed in this context. First, some well known clustering techniques, which are potentially capable of enabling clustered channel modeling, are presented. Next, the motivation of cluster-based channel modeling is presented. The typical concepts of clusters used in channel models are summarized, and the state-of-the-art clustering and tracking algorithms are reviewed and compared.

      "abstract": "Two emerging technologies toward 5G wireless networks, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive radio (CR), will provide more efficient utilization of wireless spectrum in the future. In this article, we investigate the integration of NOMA with CR into a holistic system, namely a cognitive NOMA network, for more intelligent spectrum sharing. Design principles of cognitive NOMA networks are perfectly aligned to functionality requirements of 5G wireless networks, such as high spectrum efficiency, massive connectivity, low latency, and better fairness. Three different cognitive NOMA architectures are presented, including underlay NOMA networks, overlay NOMA networks, and CR-inspired NOMA networks. To address inter-network and intra-network interference, which largely degrade the performance of cognitive NOMA networks, cooperative relaying strategies are proposed. For each cognitive NOMA architecture, our proposed cooperative relaying strategy shows its potential to significantly lower outage probabilities. We discuss open challenges and future research directions on implementation of cognitive NOMA networks.",

In this tutorial, we treat that problem in a holistic way, as a part of solving a puzzle of selection of changeable characteristics of system devices. The goal is to achieve best results, which implies matching to the local signal environment. We take into account both intended and incidental interactions, among the system devices and with their environment. We propose meta-heuristics that puts together the concepts of multidimensional space with elements of graph theory and genetic and linear programming algorithms. That approach is service- and technology-agnostic, applicable to non-cognitive systems too.",

      "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to realize user requirements with low-latency applications. The deep integration of multi-access technologies and MEC can significantly enhance the access capacity between heterogeneous devices and MEC platforms. However, the traditional MEC network architecture cannot be directly applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to high speed mobility and inherent characteristics. Furthermore, given a large number of resource-rich vehicles on the road, it is a new opportunity to execute task offloading and data processing onto smart vehicles. To facilitate good merging of the MEC technology in IoV, this article first introduces a vehicular edge multi-access network that treats vehicles as edge computation resources to construct the cooperative and distributed computing architecture. For immersive applications, co-located vehicles have the inherent properties of collecting considerable identical and similar computation tasks. We propose a collaborative task offloading and output transmission mechanism to guarantee low latency as well as the application- level performance. Finally, we take 3D reconstruction as an exemplary scenario to provide insights on the design of the network framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to reduce the perception reaction time while ensuring the application-level driving experiences.",

Data rate demands, driven by the growing use of broadband services, are expected to increase continuously over the next few decades. TWDM PONs and WDM PONs show the most promise for emerging broadband services involving various applications. In both TWDM and WDM PONs, a colorless light source or tunable transmitter is used on the ONU side and is indispensable for low-cost and plug-and-play ONUs. This article describes the principles of different colorless- light-source schemes and the architectures of the corresponding TWDM and WDM PON systems. Also, their transmission performances are analyzed and compared. Further, four types of wavelength control methods for light sources based on tunable laser diodes are described and analyzed. The features, characteristics, and applicability of the various colorless-light and tunablelight- source schemes are analyzed and compared.",

In this article, four directions to tackle the crucial problem of distance limitation are investigated, namely, a distance-aware physical layer design, ultra-massive MIMO communication, reflectarrays, and intelligent surfaces. Additionally, the potential joint design of these solutions is proposed to combine the benefits and further extend the communication distance. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed solutions. The feasibility of mmWave and THz band communications up to 100 m in both line-of-sight and nonline- of-sight areas are demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "Social-aware algorithms have marked themselves as the most successful strategies for cost-effective content delivery in mobile opportunistic networks. However, these strategies do not consider the importance of users' geographical locations or the spatial properties of human mobility. Given this fact, in this work we propose to combine spatial and social properties to improve the cost effectiveness of content delivery in opportunistic device-to-device networks. We leverage and describe four spatial and social properties and characterize them in a real-world dataset. As a proof of concept of employing those properties, we propose SAMPLER, a forwarding algorithm that combines social awareness, points of interest within a region, and users' individual mobility patterns to cost-effectively deliver messages in opportunistic device-to-device networks. We compare SAMPLER to the state-of-the-art social-aware algorithm Bubble Rap, and with a modified version of Bubble Rap that incorporates static relay nodes. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world (NCCU) and state-of-the-art synthetic (SWIM) traces, confirm that the combination of social and spatial awareness can increase the delivery performance.",

      "abstract": "The IoV enables drivers to obtain information on road conditions, accidents, and navigation. Applications in this framework collect information through message exchanges among vehicles. However, existing routing protocols in wireless sensor networks are not suitable for IoV due to the dynamically changing network topology. Furthermore, when the density of vehicles is sparse, it is difficult to achieve long-distance transmission for common routing protocols. In this article, we present a novel scheme that incorporates a community-aware mechanism to propagate data packets based on smartphones and vehicles. Cell connections via smartphones are incorporated to transmit data packets over long distances in this scheme. The process of searching usable smartphones is based on a community-aware mechanism. We use this to determine a contact list for each vehicle for long-distance transmission, thus significantly reducing the data packet delay. The small world feature is added to IoV by constructing communication relationships between smartphones. When a vehicle fails to forward messages, our scheme can quickly find another vehicle to replace it. Thus, the robustness of IoV is enhanced. We compare our protocol to CAR and GPSR. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms these protocols in terms of data packet delays and the packet delivery ratio.",

      "abstract": "Spectrum sensing research has mostly been focusing on narrowband access, and not until recently have researchers started looking at wideband spectrum. Broadly speaking, wideband spectrum sensing approaches can be categorized into two classes: Nyquist-rate and sub-Nyquistrate sampling approaches. Nyquist-rate approaches have major practical issues that question their suitability for real-time applications; this is mainly because their high-rate sampling requirement calls for complex hardware and signal processing algorithms that incur significant delays. Sub-Nyquistrate approaches, on the other hand, are more appealing due to their less stringent sampling rate requirement. Although various concepts have been investigated to ensure sub-Nyquist rates, compressive sampling theory is definitely one concept that has attracted much interest. This article explains and illustrates how compressive sampling has been leveraged to improve wideband spectrum sensing by enabling spectrum occupancy recovery with sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The article also introduces new ideas with great potential for further wideband spectrum sensing enhancements, and identifies key future research challenges and directions that remain to be investigated.",

      "abstract": "The ultra-dense network (UDN) is envisioned to be an enabling and highly promising technology to enhance spatial multiplexing and network capacity in future 5G networks. Moreover, to address the conflict between computation-intensive applications and resource-constrained IoT mobile devices (MDs), multi-access mobile edge computing (MA-MEC), which provides the IoT MDs with cloud capabilities at the edge of radio access networks, has been proposed. UDN and MA-MEC are regarded as two distinct but complementary enabling technologies for 5G IoT applications. Over the past several years, lots of research on mobile edge computation offloading (MECO) -- the key technique in MA-MEC -- has emerged. However, it is noticed that all these works focused on the single-tier base station scenario and computation offloading between the MD and the MEC server connected to the macro base station, and few works can be found on the problem of computation offloading for MA-MEC in UDN (i.e., a multi-user ultra-dense MEC server scenario). Toward this end, we study in this article the MECO problem in UDN and propose a heuristic greedy offloading scheme as our solution. Extensive numerical results and comparisons demonstrate the necessity for and superior performance of conducting computation offloading over multiple MEC servers.",

      "abstract": "The Internet has crossed new frontiers with access to it getting faster and cheaper. Considering that the architectural foundations of today's Internet were laid more than three decades ago, the Internet has done remarkably well until today coping with the growing demand. However, the future Internet architecture is expected to support not only the ever growing number of users and devices, but also a diverse set of new applications and services. Departing from the traditional host-centric access paradigm, where access to a desired content is mapped to its location, an information-centric model enables the association of access to a desired content with the content itself, irrespective of the location where it is being held. UMOBILE tailors the information-centric communication model to meet the requirements of opportunistic communications, integrating those connectivity approaches into a single architecture. By pushing services near the edge of the network, such an architecture can pervasively operate in any networking environment and allows for the development of innovative applications, providing access to data independent of the level of end-to-end connectivity availability.",

      "abstract": "In multi-channel CRAHNs, the spectrum efficiency can be improved via spectrum reutilization by secondary users. However, unpredictable transmission interruptions may occur when primary users reclaim their channels, resulting in the partition of the CRAHN and the failure of the end-to-end transmission. Therefore, in CRAHNs, considering the activities of primary users, how to maintain a connected network topology is fundamental in ensuring reliable secondary communications. Even though one licensed channel is reclaimed by a PU, multiple SUs may be affected. The situation gets even worse when multiple channels are reclaimed simultaneously. In this article, we elaborate on k-channel connectivity in the context of multi-channel CRAHNs. We first introduce the preliminaries of topology connectivity with the focus on the k-channel connectivity and then discuss the challenges of robust topology control by guaranteeing the k-channel connectivity in both interweave mode and underlay mode. After reviewing the recent research on topology control algorithms, we propose a distributed k-channel connectivity algorithm in underlay mode to minimize the number of required channels while satisfying the k-channel connectivity and conflict-free property. Next, we illustrate the potential benefits of k-channel connectivity through simulation results. Finally, possible directions for future research are pointed out in the conclusions.",

      "abstract": "ICNs are promising alternatives to current Internet architecture since the Internet struggles with a number of issues such as scalability, mobility, and security. ICN offers a number of potential benefits including reduced congestion and enhanced delivery performance by employing content caching, simpler network configurations, and stronger security for the content. NDN, an instance of ICN, enables content delivery instead of host-centric approaches by naming data rather than host. In order to make NDN practical in the real world, the challenging issues of content security need to be addressed. In this article, we examine the architecture and content security as well as possible solutions to these issues of NDN, with a special focus on the content integrity and provenance. We propose a variety of digital signature schemes to achieve the data integrity and origin authentication in NDN for various applications, which include cost-effective signatures, privacy preserving signatures, network coding signatures, and post-quantum signatures. We also present speed-up techniques in generating signatures and verifying signatures such as pre-computation, batch verification, and server-aided verification to reduce the computational cost of the producers and receivers in NDN. A number of certificate-free trust management approaches and possible adoptions in NDN are investigated.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the channel hopping (CH) method for the rendezvous process of secondary users in multi-channel CRAHNs is overviewed. With the evolution of the Internet of Things, design criteria of CH sequences targeting these applications are discussed. While channel collision among CH sequences is inherent in realistic CRAHNs, most prior works focused on sequence designs without addressing the channel collision problem. Hence, the concept of contention resolution in CRAHNs is introduced in this article, and a \"multi-round\" contention resolution mechanism is studied. To quantify the performance, the RS rate of the mechanism is presented and validated with computer simulation. Finally, the rendezvous time savings, which, in turn, can enhance data throughput, of the multi-round mechanism over a single-round one are investigated.",

However, test environments have to keep up with the evolution of technology and require continuous update and redesign. In this article, we propose COINS, a framework that can be used by wireless technology developers to enable CI practices in their testbed infrastructure. As a proof-of-concept, we provide a reference architecture and implementation of COINS for controlled testing of multi-technology 5G MTC networks. The implementation upgrades an existing wireless experimentation testbed with new software and hardware functionalities. It blends web service technology and operating system virtualization technologies with emerging Internet of Things technologies enabling CI for wireless networks. Moreover, we also extend an existing qualitative methodology for comparing similar frameworks and identify and discuss open challenges for wider use of CI practices in wireless technology development.",

The progressive video service that will make up the majority of future network traffic has more demands for transmission bandwidth, network capacity, and management flexibility. Moreover, denser connectivity, higher reliability, lower latency, and better interaction impose some great challenges to existing networks. In order to meet these growing demands, a promising approach is to integrate a broadcast network with a cellular network. In this article, we briefly set forth the latest progress on the cellular network and the broadcast network, respectively. Then the logic architecture of the integrated network is given to clarify the functional partitioning. In addition, the physical architecture of the integrated network is presented to enable coordination in different aspects. Some feasible strategies are discussed and several promising technologies are presented.",

      "abstract": "Reliable and efficient identification of spectrum access opportunities is crucial for cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs). A promising method to improve sensing reliability is CSS, where sensing data from multiple secondary users is combined to facilitate decision making. However, the performance of CSS algorithms in CRAHNs is limited by two challenges. First, the spectrum occupancy status in CRAHNs is spatially heterogeneous. Second, malfunctioning nodes or malicious attackers may falsify the true sensing results. To handle both these challenges, inspired by image segmentation in computer vision, we propose a novel graph-cut CSS algorithm. This algorithm is robust in the presence of false sensing data reports, computationally efficient (with polynomial worst case time complexity), and can be implemented distributively. Theoretically, it can be regarded as a new data fusion scheme that is generalized from classical likelihood ratio tests when sensing information is fully exploited, or from the majority fusion rule, when thresholded sensing information is utilized.",

      "abstract": "Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), composed of densely deployed base stations of different types with various radio access technologies, have become a prevailing trend to accommodate ever increasing traffic demand. Nowadays, users rely heavily on HWNs for ubiquitous network access to support critical applications such as financial transactions, e-health, and public safety. Cyber risks, representing one of the most significant threats to network security and reliability, are increasing in severity. To address this problem, this article introduces the concept of cyber insurance to transfer the cyber risks in HWNs to a third-party insurer. First, a review of the enabling technologies for HWNs and their vulnerabilities to cyber risks is presented. Then the fundamentals of cyber insurance are introduced, and subsequently, a cyber insurance framework for HWNs is presented. Finally, open issues are discussed and the challenges are highlighted for integrating cyber insurance as a service of next generation HWNs.",

      "abstract": "Interference and traffic imbalance hinder improved system performance in heterogeneous ultra-dense networks. Network cooperation has become a promising paradigm with sophisticated techniques that can significantly enhance performance. In this article, a coalition game-theoretic framework is introduced to characterize cooperative behaviors, thus exploring these cooperative benefits and diversity gains. First, we introduce the basis of the coalition games. Then we survey its latest applications, in particular, interference mitigation and traffic offloading. Different from most current applications, we concentrate on cooperative incentive mechanism design since node cooperation always means resource consumption and other costs. Moreover, for the incentive mechanism, cooperative spectrum leasing is introduced. To mitigate interference and balance traffic, we propose two schemes under the presented framework: IASL and TOSL. Simulation results show the improved performance of the cooperative gains using the proposed IASL and TOSL schemes.",

These data cannot be efficiently collected and processed in WSNs due to the weak communication capability of these networks. This drawback can be compensated for by amalgamating WSNs and cloud computing to obtain sensor clouds. In this article, we investigate, highlight, and report recent premier advances in sensor clouds with respect to data collection. We categorize and classify the literature by devising a taxonomy based on important parameters, such as objectives, applications, communication technology, collection types, discovery, data types, and classification. Moreover, a few prominent use cases are presented to highlight the role of sensor clouds in providing high computation capabilities. Furthermore, several open research challenges and issues, such as big data issues, deployment issues, data security, data aggregation, dissemination of control message, and on time delivery are discussed. Future research directions are also provided.",

This means that they can be combined to derive abundant valuable knowledge. However, the collected data may also be accessed by malicious third parties to reveal sensitive information. In this article, we investigate the privacy issues of linkable data in smart IoT systems, which have not been thoroughly studied in previous works. We first discuss the available data sources in smart IoT systems and their linkage. Then we introduce some third parties who may access and utilize the linkable data.

      "abstract": "Communications and information are the basis of smart city development. Hence, the performance of information transmissions is vital for the popularity of smart city services. This article is a tutorial study on efficiently managing communication performance in a real-time fashion for smart cities that have a vast number of networking nodes and services. We focus on both QoS and QoE performance and discuss the challenges in guaranteeing such performance by analyzing the characteristics of smart city communication networks. We then explore the opportunity of employing data to automatically manage QoS/ QoE performance by designing a data-driven QoS and QoE framework. This framework implements the functions of training performance prediction and accordingly timely management of QoS/QoE performance via the designed offline and online modules, respectively. We hope that this study may provide preliminary knowledge and research insights for further studies on proactively guaranteeing the performance of a varied number of coexisting and correlated smart city communicators.",

      "abstract": "Advances in software defined radio (SDR) technology allow unprecedented control on the entire processing chain, allowing modification of each functional block as well as sampling the changes in the input waveform. This article describes a method for uniquely identifying a specific radio among nominally similar devices using a combination of SDR sensing capability and machine learning (ML) techniques. The key benefit of this approach is that ML operates on raw I/Q samples and distinguishes devices using only the transmitter hardware-induced signal modifications that serve as a unique signature for a particular device. No higher-level decoding, feature engineering, or protocol knowledge is needed, further mitigating challenges of ID spoofing and coexistence of multiple protocols in a shared spectrum. The contributions of the article are as follows: (i) The operational blocks in a typical wireless communications processing chain are modified in a simulation study to demonstrate RF impairments, which we exploit. (ii) Using an overthe- air dataset compiled from an experimental testbed of SDRs, an optimized deep convolutional neural network architecture is proposed, and results are quantitatively compared with alternate techniques such as support vector machines and logistic regression. (iii) Research challenges for increasing the robustness of the approach, as well as the parallel processing needs for efficient training, are described. Our work demonstrates up to 90-99 percent experimental accuracy at transmitter- receiver distances varying between 2-50 ft over a noisy, multi-path wireless channel.",

      "abstract": "Quality of experience (QoE) is the overall acceptability of an application or service, as perceived subjectively by the end user. In particular, for video quality the QoE is dependent of video transmission parameters. To monitor and control these parameters is critical in modern network management systems, but it would be better to be able to monitor the QoE itself (in terms of both interpretation and accuracy) rather than the parameters on which it depends. In this article we present the first attempt to predict video QoE based on information directly extracted from the network packets using a deep learning model. The QoE detector is based on a binary classifier (good or bad quality) for seven common classes of anomalies when watching videos (blur, ghost, etc.). Our classifier can detect anomalies at the current time instant and predict them at the next immediate instant. This classifier faces two major challenges: first, a highly unbalanced dataset with a low proportion of samples with video anomaly, and second, a small amount of training data, since it must be obtained from individual viewers under a controlled experimental setup. The proposed classifier is based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, and Gaussian process classifier. Image processing, which is the common domain for a CNN, has been expanded to QoE detection. Based on a detailed comparison, the proposed model offers better performance metrics than alternative machine learning algorithms, and can be used as a QoE monitoring function in edge computing.",

      "abstract": "The increase in the number and diversity of smart objects has raised substantial cybersecurity challenges due to the recent exponential rise in the occurrence and sophistication of attacks. Although cloud computing has transformed the world of business in a dramatic way, its centralization hammers the application of distributed services such as security mechanisms for IoT applications. The new and emerging IoT applications require novel cybersecurity controls, models, and decisions distributed at the edge of the network. Despite the success of the existing cryptographic solutions in the traditional Internet, factors such as system development flaws, increased attack surfaces, and hacking skills have proven the inevitability of detection mechanisms. The traditional approaches such as classical machine-learning-based attack detection mechanisms have been successful in the last decades, but it has already been proven that they have low accuracy and less scalability for cyber-attack detection in massively distributed nodes such as IoT. The proliferation of deep learning and hardware technology advancement could pave a way to detecting the current level of sophistication of cyber-attacks in edge networks. The application of deep networks has already been successful in big data areas, and this indicates that fog-tothings computing can be the ultimate beneficiary of the approach for attack detection because a massive amount of data produced by IoT devices enable deep models to learn better than shallow algorithms. In this article, we propose a novel distributed deep learning scheme of cyber-attack detection in fog-to-things computing. Our experiments show that deep models are superior to shallow models in detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Our daily lives have been immersed in widespread location-based social networks (LBSNs). As an open platform, LBSNs typically allow all kinds of users to register accounts. Malicious attackers can easily join and post misleading information, often with the intention of influencing users' decisions in urban computing environments. To provide reliable information and improve the experience for legitimate users, we design and implement DeepScan, a malicious account detection system for LBSNs. Different from existing approaches, DeepScan leverages emerging deep learning technologies to learn users' dynamic behavior. In particular, we introduce the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct time series analysis of user activities. DeepScan combines newly introduced time series features and a set of conventional features extracted from user activities, and exploits a supervised machine-learning-based model for detection. Using real traces collected from Dianping, a representative LBSN, we demonstrate that DeepScan can achieve excellent prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.964. We also find that the time series features play a critical role in the detection system.",

      "abstract": "The aim of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is to provide determinism to IEEE 802 networks. With TSN, data streams of general background applications can share the same standards-based network infrastructure without impacting time-critical applications, also leading to cost savings by using a single network infrastructure. Deterministic ultra-low latency increases efficiency for operations that require consistent message exchange. The most stringent delay requirements are specified for industrial and fronthaul network applications; thus, we demonstrate network engineering aspects in these two networking scenarios. In industrial networking, deterministic delays are important, especially for real-time control processes. In fronthaul networks, the timely delivery of data units with minimum delay variations is required for efficient operation. In this article, we present two mature TSN tools: time gated queuing and frame preemption. Then we highlight their operational and design aspects when using them in industrial and fronthaul networks, investigating their applicability through different simulation scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The ubiquitous connectivity between vehicles and smart transportation infrastructure will facilitate the information flow necessary for empowering smart service for efficient, safe, and eco-friendly transportation of people and goods. Although vehicular communication technologies is quickly advancing toward ubiquitously connected cars, the design of networking protocols for such vehicles is still in its infancy, facing multiple daunting challenges. In this article, we advocate for the use of the information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm for the full realization of connected cars, that is, the integration of both in-car computing systems and the car-to-digital world. We discuss the emerging challenges for the design of ICN-based protocols for connected cars, and we formally put the current debate into perspective regarding which transmission mode (broadcast or unicast) should prevail for the design of such protocols. Concerning this debate, we propose to classify recent and representative protocols in broadcast and unicast-oriented solutions, and we highlight the trade-offs of each approach. Based on a critical qualitative evaluation, we advocate that adaptive and hybrid approaches would perform better for information- centric connected cars. Hence, we provide a guideline for the further design of ICN-based protocols for connected cars. Finally, we discuss some future research directions that might be considered to advance the process of content distribution in connected cars.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been widely used in the military and commercial domains. UAVs, especially in the military domain, were initially used for gathering intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data, and sending them to a command center. Their use was then expanded to the tactical level to perform military operations with manned platforms. Operating a UAV as a relay node in the air has many advantages, including coverage, recovery from disconnection from a relay, clear communication channel, and easy deployment. Thus, the UAV-Relay tactical network can support more effective military operations. However, reliable UAV control and situational awareness must be guaranteed for the use of tactical UAVs. In other words, all tactical nodes must be able to send their location and status periodically under the dynamic and unexpected situation of a battlefield. However, a jamming attack from the enemy can make UAV control and situational awareness impossible. Thus, we need a robust tactical data link (TDL) to guarantee reliable UAV control and situational awareness under a jamming attack. In this article, we first explain the requirements for reliable UAV control and situational awareness. We then design a future UAV-relay TDL, called link-situational awareness and control (Link-SAC), which satisfies the requirements. We also deal with the spectrum allocation and management of Link-SAC because Link-SAC requires large bandwidth under the scarcity of spectrum resource. Thus, we consider spectrum sharing to allocate an X-Band uplink to Link-SAC. Based on the interference analysis in a prior study, we show that spectrum sharing is possible. We also show how Link-SAC can manage the spectrum. Lastly, we present our concluding remarks.",

      "abstract": "Turbo codes, prevalent in most modern cellular devices, are set to be replaced by LDPC codes as the code for forward error correction. This transition was ushered in mainly because of the high throughput demands for 5G New Radio (NR). The new channel coding solution also needs to support incremental-redundancy hybrid ARQ, and a wide range of blocklengths and coding rates, with stringent performance guarantees and minimal description complexity. In this article, we first briefly review the requirements of the new channel code for 5G NR. We then describe the LDPC code design philosophy and how the broad requirements of 5G NR channel coding led to the introduction of novel structural features in the code design, culminating in an LDPC code that satisfies all the demands of 5G NR.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we design differential frameworks for monitoring smart city and extensive ocean by multiple heterogeneous smart UAVs. Since the requirements and fundamental environments between smart city and extensive ocean are quite different, we consider two differential strategies. For smart city, we introduce a tight plane-based framework that utilizes the existing public transportation including public buses, city trains, and their routes to provide time-sensitive surveillance. For extensive ocean, we develop a loose hierarchical-based framework. To support seamless surveillance over extensive ocean, we use three types of UAVs, which allows replenishment among heterogeneous UAVs at different layers through airborne docking. Moreover, the research challenges and open issues related to the differentiated infrastructures are presented.",

      "abstract": "Radiological pollution, which poses a great threat to public health and environment safety, is one of the critical concerns in nuclear industries. The ever growing IIoT is a promising network paradigm for monitoring the radiological pollution level in uranium mill tailings. Coverage, as one of the most decisive indicators for evaluating the success of IIoT-based radiological pollution monitoring, reflects how well the sensing fields of interest are monitored. Nevertheless, the possible coverage holes resulting from sensors' random deployment, energy depletion, and hazardous conditions may remarkably lower the QoS, especially the coverage performance of IIoT-based radiological pollution monitoring. In order to avoid the potential emerging coverage holes' negative effects on the network QoS, this article focuses on the coverage hole detection issue from an energy-efficient perspective. By exploiting the merits of the CIC model, this article develops an EECICHD that detects the CIC holes by fully considering the sensor nodes' energy dissipation as well as their communication abilities. The EECICHD makes full use of the intrinsic spatial distribution correlation of monitored variables and collaborative sensing among neighboring sensors for improving the efficiency of CIC holes detection. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed EECICHD scheme can efficiently localize and determine the locations and number of the CIC holes.",

The goal of this survey article is to study various potential cyber and physical threats that may arise from the use of UAVs, and subsequently review various ways to detect, track, and interdict malicious drones. In particular, we review techniques that rely on ambient radio frequency signals (emitted from UAVs), radars, acoustic sensors, and computer vision techniques for detection of malicious UAVs. We present some early experimental and simulation results on range estimation of UAVs and receding horizon tracking of UAVs. Finally, we summarize common techniques that are considered for interdiction of UAVs.",

In this paradigm, there is a need to allocate the resources with a view to maximizing the utility (e.g., the total throughput) and mitigating the interference caused by sharing the same spectrum between cellular users and D2D pairs. This article, which is tutorial in nature, proposes a scheme for maximizing the total number of active D2D pairs and reused channels while minimizing the aggregate transmit power of cellular users and D2D pairs and maintaining their required QoS to the extent possible. This reduces the load on base stations, lessens power consumption, and improves spectrum efficiency beyond the conventional cellular frequency reuse schemes. Unlike many existing works that assume a single cell, we consider a multi-cell scenario in which the transmitter and the receiver of each D2D pair can be in the same cell or in different cells, and each user can simultaneously transmit over multiple reused channels. The allocation is done via a centralized baseband processing in the cloud radio access network architecture. Simulations show that via our proposed scheme, more users (both cellular users and D2D pairs) can simultaneously communicate, and the total system throughput is also significantly increased.",

      "abstract": "The incoming 5G systems propose unprecedented communication capabilities that require a maximization of the channel and spectrum exploitation. Waveguide antenna arrays can play an important role in 5G environments due to their high performance in terms of efficiency and bandwidth. Moreover, higher frequencies appear necessary in order to achieve the requirements of channel capacity and spectrum bandwidth. At millimeter-wave frequencies, new challenges for the design and fabrication of the communication devices are encountered. The feasibility of traditional manufacturing techniques and conventional additive manufacturing processes severely decreases, since part tolerances, assembly, and alignment become critical for the antenna performance. In order to illustrate the possibilities of the diffusion bonding technique applied to waveguide antennas operating in the W-band of 5G systems, a circularly polarized cavity array has been successfully manufactured. This manufacturing process provides the advantages of both traditional and additive manufacturing. A 5.6 percent effective bandwidth at 90 GHz has been experimentally obtained with reflected power under 10 percent, axial ratio below 3 dB, and antenna efficiency over 50 percent.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for delay-sensitive and context-aware IoT data analytics, through migrating data processing from the cloud to the edge of the network. However, traditional solutions adopting homomorphic encryption to achieve data protection and aggregation at edge servers are infeasible because of their heavy computational overhead. How to preserve data privacy while guaranteeing data utility in edge computing becomes an extremely important problem for IoT data analytics. In this article, we propose a local differential privacy obfuscation (LDPO) framework for IoT data analytics to aggregate and distill the IoT data at the edge without disclosing users' sensitive data. We first introduce the architecture and benefits of the LDPO framework, followed by some technical challenges in guaranteeing its performance. Then we present a preliminary implementation of the LDPO framework, and validate its performance in terms of privacy preservation level and data utility using real-world apps and datasets. Some future directions are finally envisioned for further research.",

      "abstract": "Real-time cooperation among agents requires sharing of certain temporal information. That information might take the form of \"take action X right now!\" or it might better be achieved in some cases by establishing an a priori agreement by which each action should be taken and when, together with a shared understanding of what time it is. Distributed applications increasingly rely on this latter synchronized time approach rather than explicit \"right now!\" communication for cooperative sense and control tasks. Such a capability is foundational to the field of cyber physical systems (CPS) where computation and communication interact with the physical world in real time. While multiple historical approaches exist for time-synchronized (and timely) communication among sensing, computing, and actuating devices, the addition of robust temporal performance characteristics to standard Ethernet through the work of the Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of IEEE 802.1 is bringing together the benefits of standard IT networking with excellent worst case latency and synchronization performance that was previously available only to these specialized and sometimes proprietary networks. Such advances will be important in next-generation applications as diverse as CPS/real-time distributed control, smart factories, sensor fusion, autonomous vehicles, and even cloud applications [1]. As we show, precision network time synchronization can dramatically enhance the operation of these applications and is a requirement of certain new network latency enhancements as well.",

While these drones offer advantages such as rapid deployment to far-flung areas, their operations may be rendered ineffective by the absence of an adequate energy management strategy. This article considers the multi-faceted applications of these platforms and the challenges thereof in the networks of the future. In addition to providing an overview of the work done by researchers in determining the features of the air-to-ground channel, the article explores the use of drones in fields as diverse as military surveillance and network rehabilitation for disaster-struck areas. It also presents a case study that envisages a scenario in which drones operate alongside conventional wireless infrastructure, thereby allowing a greater number of users to establish a line-of-sight link for communication. This study investigates a power allocation strategy for the microwave base station and the small base stations operating at 28 GHz frequency band. The self-adaptive power control strategy for drones is dependent on the maximum allowable interference threshold and minimum data rate requirements. This study highlights the importance of incorporating the drones in the multi-tier heterogeneous network to extend the network coverage and capacity.",

      "abstract": "Wireless spectrum licensing has increased due to the continuous evolution and use of cellular technology. The increase in the number of mobile-connected devices and global data traffic demand has led to a significant increase in demand for spectrum access with studies showing that there is unexploited capacity in the spectrum. This is especially critical for 5G networks where the service requirements are extremely stringent. To that end, this article proposes dynamic spectrum management through the combination of two innovative architectures, wireless resource virtualization (WRV) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. WRV allows for better utilization of the spectrum, while reducing both the capital and operational expenditures. On the other hand, M2M communications can help boost capacity and improve quality of service by leveraging spectrum access across multiple radio technologies. In this article, a brief discussion of multi-radio access technology heterogeneous networks is given. Then the problem of dynamic spectrum management through resource virtualization with M2M communications is described. To the best of our knowledge, such a combined framework has not been previously proposed. Two different algorithms are proposed to evaluate the performance of the considered architecture, namely a decomposition- based algorithm and a greedy-based algorithm. Simulation results show that such architecture can boost the overall capacity of the system by achieving higher data rates. Moreover, it is shown that the number of possibly supported M2M pairs is increased while using the same spectrum.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has paved the way to real-time big data storage, access, and processing in the cloud environment. In IIoT, the big data generated by various devices such as-smartphones, wireless body sensors, and smart meters will be on the order of zettabytes in the near future. Hence, relaying this huge amount of data to the remote cloud platform for further processing can lead to severe network congestion. This in turn will result in latency issues which affect the overall QoS for various applications in IIoT. To cope with these challenges, a recent paradigm shift in computing, popularly known as edge computing, has emerged. Edge computing can be viewed as a complement to cloud computing rather than as a competition. The cooperation and interplay among cloud and edge devices can help to reduce energy consumption in addition to maintaining the QoS for various applications in the IIoT environment. However, a large number of migrations among edge devices and cloud servers leads to congestion in the underlying networks. Hence, to handle this problem, SDN, a recent programmable and scalable network paradigm, has emerged as a viable solution. Keeping focus on all the aforementioned issues, in this article, an SDN-based edge-cloud interplay is presented to handle streaming big data in IIoT environment, wherein SDN provides an efficient middleware support. In the proposed solution, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using Tchebycheff decomposition for flow scheduling and routing in SDN is presented. The proposed scheme is evaluated with respect to two optimization objectives, that is, the trade-off between energy efficiency and latency, and the trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the proposed flow scheduling scheme in the IIoT environment.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of next-generation network technologies provides a huge improvement in healthcare facilities. Technologies such as 5G, edge computing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things realize smart healthcare that a client can have anytime, anywhere, and in real time. Edge computing offers useful computing resources at the edge of the network to maintain low-latency and real-time computing. In this article, we propose a smart healthcare framework using edge computing. In the framework, we develop a voice disorder assessment and treatment system using a deep learning approach. A client provides his or her voice sample captured by smart sensors, and the sample goes to the edge computing for initial processing. Then the edge computing sends data to a core cloud for further processing. The assessment and management are controlled by a service provider through a cloud manager. Once the automatic assessment is done, the decision is sent to specialists, who prescribe appropriate treatment to the clients. The proposed system achieves 98.5 percent accuracy and 99.3 percent sensitivity using the Saarbrucken Voice Disorder database.",

      "abstract": "The major challenges that urban living has presented in recent years, as a result of the increasing population density, have triggered a discussion about the development of effective solutions that target the economic, social and environmental sustainability of urban areas. Environmental concerns have stressed the need for the development of innovative solutions for the effective and flexible utilization of renewable energy. In this article, we study the benefits of cooperation as an alternative solution to the optimum management of the energy generated, stored and consumed in urban buildings. The proposed cooperative energy management scheme is applied to a group of smart buildings of diverse energy consumption patterns that form a cluster and exchange energy, so that an optimum utilization of the energy generated by local renewables is achieved. We also demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the cooperative energy management system on a representative Superblock of Barcelona, since the idea of building cooperation is inspired by Barcelona's unique smart community planning model. The results indicate the significant reduction of power management cost (32.52 percent on average) and carbon emissions (62.88 percent on average) compared to the no power-exchange case, due to the optimal utilization of energy from renewable sources.",

This limitation hinders taking effective actions in various applications including cognitive radios, electrosmog monitoring, and law enforcement. We introduce Electrosense, an initiative that seeks a more efficient, safe and reliable monitoring of the electromagnetic space by improving the accessibility of spectrum data for the general public. A collaborative spectrum monitoring network is designed that monitors the spectrum at large scale with low-cost spectrum sensing nodes. The large set of data is stored and processed in a big data architecture and provided back to the community with an open spectrum data as a service model, that allows users to build diverse and novel applications with different requirements. We illustrate useful usage scenarios of the Electrosense data.",

      "abstract": "With the development of mCRAHNs, more emerging mobile applications and services could be foreseen and applied in our human society. In this article, we propose an emotion-aware cognitive system (ECS), which aims to provide a systematic approach that can facilitate deployment of different emotion-aware mobile applications in mCRAHNs. ECS is constructed to provide multidimensional emotional data collection and processing approaches for mobile applications working in mCRAHNs. Also, we present a flow of emotion-aware solution designed on ECS, and highlight the implementation and orchestration of several key technologies and schemes we apply in this system for different emotion-aware mobile applications in runtime. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed ECS by presenting a novel emotion-aware mobile application, iSmile, and evaluate the system performance based on this application.",

      "abstract": "The millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands and other high frequencies above 6 GHz have emerged as a central component of fifth generation cellular standards to deliver high data rates and ultra-low latency. A key challenge in these bands is blockage from obstacles, including the human body. In addition to the reduced coverage, blockage can result in highly intermittent links where the signal quality varies significantly with motion of obstacles in the environment. The blockages have widespread consequences throughout the protocol stack including beam tracking, link adaptation, cell selection, handover, and congestion control. Accurately modeling these blockage dynamics is therefore critical for the development and evaluation of potential mmWave systems. In this work, we present a novel spatial dynamic channel sounding system based on phased array transmitters and receivers operating at 60 GHz. Importantly, the sounder can measure multiple directions rapidly at high speed to provide detailed spatial dynamic measurements of complex scenarios. The system is demonstrated in an indoor home entertainment type setting with multiple moving blockers. Preliminary results are presented on analyzing this data with a discussion of the open issues toward developing statistical dynamic models.",

      "abstract": "The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.",

We give an overview of the relevant TSN protocol services and motivate the use of TSN. We propose a configuration agent architecture based on IEEE 802.1Qcc and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), capable of performing runtime network configuration. We briefly present the configuration challenges for scheduled networks (considering a subset of TSN mechanisms), and illustrate one problem: the configuration of schedule tables of such networks for hard real-time control applications. We propose a list scheduling-based heuristic to solve this problem. Our evaluation and comparison to previous work demonstrate the feasibility of reconfiguring the scheduled network at runtime for industrial applications within the fog.",

SPHERE is a multi-modal platform of non-medical sensors for behavior monitoring in residential environments that aims to overcome this major limitation of healthcare provision by using the inherently cost-efficient and scalable technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT). One of SPHERE's key tasks is to help bring the next-generation low-power wireless networking and sensing technologies from the lab to the field by applying them in realworld environments. In this article we describe the highlights of SPHERE's system requirements, architecture, practical challenges, and design and deployment lessons learned. By leveraging novel IoT technologies such as the IEEE 802.15.4 network protocol, SPHERE has achieved successful initial deployments in 12 volunteer houses at the time of this writing.",

      "abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks are expected to balance the supply and demand in smart grid by reducing the peak-to-average ratio of power grid load curve. We are entering the era of wireless communication, where we can enjoy various advantages such as lower cost, lower battery consumption, and lower access latency. We believe advanced wireless communication techniques have great potential to further promote the economical deployment of V2G network and lower energy consumption. In this article, we address the green V2G network for efficient energy management. However, we still face many challenging issues even if we exploit the promising wireless communication technique in green V2G networks. For example, it becomes more and more challenging to achieve the efficiency and economy of renewable energy resource allocation due to the increasing number of electric vehicles and limited capacity of local aggregators (LAGs). To address the issues, we consider a software-defined green V2G network for energy management, which consists of three planes: management plane, control plane, and data plane. Specifically, the control plane is aimed at guiding both data flow and energy flow to implement an efficient and economic strategy for energy scheduling, while the data plane collects the information through LAGs for the customized services in the management plane. Additionally, we present an energy management scheme of charging stations as a case study. Simulation results reveal that our proposals could achieve delightful performance on global optimization in the software-defined green V2G network.",

Hence, surveillance drones (SDrs) are utilized to detect and eliminate potential threats. However, limited battery, and lack of efficient communication and networking solutions degrade the quality of surveillance. To this end, we conceptualize the Energy Neutral Internet of Drones (enIoD) to enable enhanced connectivity between drones by overcoming energy limitations for autonomous and continuous operation. Power provisioning with recharging stations is introduced by wireless power transfer to energize the drones. Renewable energy harvesting is utilized to realize energy neutrality, which is minimization of deficit in harvested and consumed energy in enIoD. Communication and networking architectures and protocols for realization of multi-dimensional objectives are presented. Finally, possible application areas are explained with a case study to show how enIoD operates.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing is expected to enable the cloud computing services in proximity and leverage the computational capacities at the edge of a network. Driven by massive data-hungry and energy-hungry applications, future wireless networks will need to provide various cloud-based multimedia services in a \"greener\" manner. However, limited computing capacity, wireless resources, and power supply prevent edge computing from evolving and maturing in terms of high sustainability and energy efficiency. In this article, we attempt to further improve the energy-efficient communication in mobile edge computing by proposing a device-to-device (D2D) offloading architecture. The D2D technique, in line with mobile edge computing, is responsible for offloading wireless traffic as well as computational tasks. Cooperative relay-aided transmission is also used in this architecture to pursue further improvements in a multi-cell scenario. Finally, offloading and balancing technologies are introduced to increase the total energy efficiency, decrease the inter/ intra-cell interference, deal with traffic/computational congestion, and provide better services to end users.",

      "abstract": "Cloud storage and computing, although it empowers ubiquitous and global information acquisition, analysis, and management, the latency performance and heavy traffic burdens at fronthaul/ hackhaul links have emerged as critical concerns due to the scalability issue, which consequently drives the development of edge content cache and dissemination. Despite ample research on latency and traffic load reduction, an effective design of edge content cache and dissemination from the perspective of energy efficiency is imperative. Noting the fact that wireless service demands are inherently unbalanced over geographic regions, a practical cell planning strategy of operators' basic interests should deploy base stations massively in hot spot areas and sparsely in rural areas. A mobile user is therefore able to acquire desired contents through multiple base stations in a hot spot, while performing autonomous content cache and dissemination with other mobile users in rural areas. Taking this practical constraint into consideration, this article offers energy-optimal edge content cache and dissemination designs for hot spot and rural areas. Exploiting Lyapunov optimization and optimum control theory, we demonstrate analytical foundations and principles of the proposed optimum designs. Engineering insights are also revealed through practical simulation investigations to extend the research frontier of energy-efficient edge content cache and dissemination.",

      "abstract": "With the increased population in urban areas, it has become a challenge to a service provider to manage big data coming from various users and devices. One of the fastest growing devices used by the citizens of urban areas is the smartphone. Today we can find almost nobody without at least one smartphone in their possession. While talking through a smartphone, surrounding environmental noises are added to the speech of the talker. Sometimes these noises are very annoying to the listeners. In this article, we propose a communication framework for urban mobile big data integrating an urban environment classification system. The proposed system utilizes a deep learning approach to classify environmental noises so that an appropriate noise cancellation algorithm can be used to reduce the effect of noise while having a conversation through smartphones. The proposed framework uses mobile edge computing technology to provide low-latency and efficient transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is very efficient in classifying environmental noises.",

      "abstract": "Recently, edge computing has emerged as a promising computing paradigm to meet stringent quality-of-service requirements of an increasing number of latency-sensitive applications. The core principle of edge computing is to bring the capability of cloud computing in close proximity to mobile devices, sensors, actuators, connected things and end users, thereby supporting various types of services and applications at the network edge. In this article, we design capacity-centric FiWi broadband access networks enhanced with edge computing as well as resulting fiber backhaul sharing and computation offloading capabilities. More specifically, we introduce the concept of FiWi enhanced two-level edge computing at the access edge cloud and metro edge cloud. To guarantee low end-to-end latency, we propose a TDMA based polling scheme for resource management. Furthermore, given the vital importance of experimentally demonstrating the potential and practical limitations of edge computing, we develop an experimental testbed for edge computing across converged FiWi broadband access networks. The proof-ofconcept demonstration of the testbed is studied in terms of response time and response time efficiency of both edge clouds, including their respective energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "Detection and interpretation of human activities have emerged as a challenging healthcare problem in areas such as assisted living and remote monitoring. Besides traditional approaches that rely on wearable devices and camera systems, WiFi-based technologies are evolving as a promising solution for indoor monitoring and activity recognition. This is, in part, due to the pervasive nature of WiFi in residential settings such as homes and care facilities, and the unobtrusive nature of WiFi-based sensing. Advanced signal processing techniques can accurately extract WiFi channel status information (CSI) using commercial off-the-shelf devices or bespoke hardware. This includes phase variations, frequency shifts, and signal levels. In this article, we describe the healthcare application of Doppler shifts in the WiFi CSI caused by human activities that take place in the signal coverage area. The technique is shown to recognize different types of human activities and behavior and be very suitable for applications in healthcare. Three experimental case studies are presented to illustrate the capabilities of WiFi CSI Doppler sensing in assisted living and residential care environments. We also discuss the potential opportunities and practical challenges for realworld scenarios.",

Among these domains, one of the biggest and most promising is the Internet of Things. The IEEE 1931.1 WG is currently working on the definition of an Internet standard for technical and functional interoperability of federated IoT systems for Real-Time Onsite Operations Facilitation (ROOF) that operate and function in a secure, semi-autonomous, and decentralized manner. Blockchain technology can play a key role in accomplishing this goal. In this article, after discussing the use of blockchain technology in the IoT, the architectural framework as well as the use of blockchain technology in the IEEE 1931.1 standard are discussed in terms of advantages brought, criticalities, and future improvements that are necessary for fruitful deployment within ROOF.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities have been recognized as a promising research focus around the world. To realize smart cities, computation and utilization of big data are key factors. More specifically, exploring the patterns of human mobility based on large amounts of multi-source data plays an important role in analyzing the formation of social-economic phenomena in smart cities. However, our acquired knowledge is still very limited for smart cities. In this article, we propose an integrated computing method to rescale heterogeneous traffic trajectory data, which leverages MLE and BIC. Our analysis is based on two real datasets generated by subway smart card transactions and taxi GPS trajectories from Shanghai, China, which contain more than 451 million trading records by 14 subway lines and 34 billion GPS records by 13,695 taxis. Specifically, we quantitatively explore the patterns of human mobility on weekends and weekdays. Through logarithmic binning and data fitness, we calculate the Bayesian weights to select the best fitting distributions. In addition, we leverage three metrics to analyze the patterns of human mobility in two datasets: trip displacement, trip duration, and trip interval. We obtain several important human mobility patterns and discover quite a few interesting phenomena, which lay a solid foundation for future research.",

      "abstract": "Smartphones are increasingly becoming a tool for ubiquitous access to a number of services including, but not limited to, e-commerce and home banking, and are used more and more for sensitive data storage. If, on one hand, this makes the smartphone a powerful tool in our private and professional life, on the other hand it has brought about a series of new challenging security and privacy threats, and raised the need to protect users and their data through new secure authentication protocols. In this article, we illustrate how the security level of a human authentication system is increasing from traditional systems based on the use of passwords or badges to modern systems based on biometrics. We have moved a step forward by conceiving an authentication protocol based on the combined recognition of the human face and smartphone fingerprint. Thanks to image processing techniques, both the distinctive characteristics of the face and of the device that captures the face image can be extracted from a single photo or video frame and used for a double check of user identity. The fast technological development of smartphones allows performing sophisticated operations on the device itself. From the edge computing perspective, the burden of biometric recognition and source camera identification can be moved to the end user side.",

      "abstract": "This work analyzes human behavior recognition approaches using WiFi channel state information from the perhaps less usual point of view of training and calibration needs. With the help of selected literature examples, as well as with more detailed experimental insights on our own Doppler spectrum-based approach for physical motion/presence/cardinality detection, we first classify the diverse forms of training so far employed into three main categories (trained, trained-once, and training-free). We further discuss under which conditions it is possible to move toward lighter forms of calibration or even succeed in devising fully untrained model-based solutions. Our take home messages are mainly two. First, reduced training might not necessarily kill performance (although, of course, trade-offs will emerge). Second, reduced training must come along with a careful customization of the technical detection approach to the specificities of the behavior recognition application targeted, as it seems very hard to find a one-size-fits-all solution without relying on extensive training.",

      "abstract": "The presence of a super high rate, but also cost-efficient, easy-to-deploy, and scalable, backhaul/fronthaul framework, is essential in the upcoming 5G wireless networks and beyond. Motivated by the mounting interest in unmanned flying platforms of various types, including UAVs, drones, balloons, and HAPs/MAPs/LAPs, which we refer to as networked flying platforms (NFPs), for providing communications services, and by the recent advances in free space optics (FSO), this article investigates the feasibility of a novel vertical backhaul/fronthaul framework where the NFPs transport the backhaul/fronthaul traffic between the access and core networks via point-to- point FSO links. The performance of the proposed innovative approach is investigated under different weather conditions and a broad range of system parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the FSO-based vertical backhaul/fronthaul framework can offer data rates higher than the baseline alternatives, and thus can be considered a promising solution to the emerging backhaul/fronthaul requirements of the 5G+ wireless networks, particularly in the presence of ultra-dense heterogeneous small cells. This article also presents the challenges that accompany such a novel framework and provides some key ideas toward overcoming these challenges.",

Commercialization of 5G mmWave technology will be launched soon, due to progress in RF hardware and large efforts on integration of mmWave beamforming technologies in standardization bodies such as 3GPP. The main challenges of mmWave mobility in 5G result from the impact of fast-varying channels on beamforming systems. However, the corresponding feasibility has not yet been fully investigated. In this article we first identify and review the technical challenges that remain in 5G mmWave mobile networks. We then present sample measurements of outdoor mmWave channels, and emulate the mobile system operation in them. We discuss insights, based on these results, on under what circumstances supporting mmWave mobility is feasible.",

      "abstract": "Addressing the disruptive capacity requirements of 5G networks calls for a thorough exploration of multiple technological solutions. Two promising approaches are i) the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies that enable multiplicative capacity gains, and ii) the exploration of new frequency bands to enlarge available bandwidth. While millimeter spectrum, one of the main bands under study, poses significant challenges due to its cumbersome propagation characteristics (particularly severe path loss and channel sparsity), its 10-fold frequency increase favors the deployment of reduced-size large antenna arrays for massive MIMO. However, the high cost and power consumption of its required signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters precludes mmWave beamforming from being performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders. A possible cost-effective alternative is the hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, which combines digital and analog precoders. In this article, we exploit the sparse nature of the channel to unveil an advantage in the design of the hybrid precoder. Specifically, by reformulating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix factorization problem and adopting an atomic norm minimization approach, we propose a new hybrid precoding algorithm that takes advantage of the sparse nature of the mmWave channel to approach the performance of the optimal fully digital precoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm can approach the performance achieved by unconstrained digital beamforming solutions.",

      "abstract": "To realize low-power and low-cost wireless communication over long distances, several wireless standards using sub-1 GHz frequencies have recently been proposed, each with their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of coverage, energy consumption, and throughput. However, none of them are currently flexible enough to satisfy the requirements of future dynamic and heterogeneous IoT applications. To alleviate this, a novel architecture that uses a multimodal device for flexibly employing a variety of heterogeneous sub-1 GHz wireless networks is proposed. It greatly increases network flexibility, resilience, and performance. A device design is presented together with an abstraction layer that combines the different networks into a single flexible virtual network substrate. The article elaborates on the qualitative advantages of this approach. Measurement-based simulation results show advantages in terms of energy efficiency, with significant reduction in energy use compared to a single-technology solution in a representative IoT track and trace scenario. Finally, the article identifies several open research challenges that need to be resolved to fully realize this vision of flexible multimodal communication for demanding IoT applications.",

      "abstract": "Fog computing is a new paradigm of distributed computing that extends the cloud's capability to the edge of the network. It can provide better quality of service, and is particularly suitable for IoT applications, which generally have stringent requirements on latency and reliability. In this article, we consider the flight security and safety of UAVs, which act as fog nodes in an airborne fog computing system. In particular, we propose a method to detect GPS spoofing based on the monocular camera and IMU sensor of a UAV. We also present an image localization approach to support UAV autonomous return using error reduction based on ORB feature detection and matching. The methods are demonstrated by experiments using a DJI Phantom 4 drone.",

      "abstract": "IoT has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. In fact, the number of connected devices has already surpassed the total population on Earth. Current developments in various technologies have paved the way for many IoT services that are now being deployed in different sectors. IoT can extend its scope and service provisioning capabilities with the integration of the cloud computing paradigm. Similarly, cloud cannot only access underlying IoT nodes and provide them with cloud services, but can also create further enhanced services based on the data collected from IoT nodes. However, IoT and sensor networks on the ground are often far from the cloud, which is normally accessible via the Internet. Some services require fast response and a great deal of pre-processing and filtering, and may also have security and privacy requirements. For all such cases, middleware, also known as fog, is required between the cloud and IoT devices. We present cloud-IoT integration issues followed by a comparison between fog and cloud computing. We evaluate the performance of fog computing using performance metrics such as processing delay, processing costs, and processing power, and derive the performance gains obtained in comparison to a cloud computing only approach. Finally, we identify some future research directions for fog computing.",

      "abstract": "It is generally understood that forthcoming 5G communication technologies such as full duplex (FD), massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) aim at the maximal use of communication spectrum to provide a new experience of service for users. FD provides simultaneous signal transmission and reception over the same frequency band. Massive MIMO uses massive numbers of antennas to provide high throughput connectivity for users. NOMA improves network throughput by allowing some users to access information intended for other users. SWIPT provides simultaneous information and power transfer. However, it is still very challenging to utilize these spectrum exploitation technologies to secure the needed quality of service for users in the age of the Internet of Things. In FD, the signal transmission interference to signal reception, even after analog and digital self-interference cancellation, is considerable, which downgrades both transmission and reception throughput. To maintain the favored channel characteristics, massive MIMO means to serve a few users per time unit only. In NOMA, the users' throughput is improved by compromising communication privacy. Information and power transmissions head to conflicting targets that are difficult to achieve simultaneously with SWIPT. This article introduces a new technique, called the fractional-time approach, which ensures guaranteed and better transmission and reception throughput without the need for complex FD, enables serving a massive number of users in a massive MIMO system, provides guaranteed users' throughput without security compromise as in NOMA, and delivers high volumes of both information and power transfer within a time unit.",

Meanwhile, the development of the fifth-generation cellular network technologies creates the possibility to deploy enormous sensors in the framework of the IoT and to process massive data, challenging the technologies of communications and data mining. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm, 5G Intelligent Internet of Things (5G I-IoT), to process big data intelligently and optimize communication channels. First, we articulate the concept of the 5G I-IoT and introduce three major components of the 5G I-IoT. Then we expound the interaction among these components and introduce the key methods and techniques based on our proposed paradigm, including big data mining, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. In addition, an experimental result evaluates the performance of 5G I-IoT, and the effective utilization of channels and QoS have been greatly improved. Finally, several application fields and open issues are discussed.",

Due to the strong path loss in free space at the millimeter-wave frequency range, high gain and low-cost antennas are in great demand. Also, advanced features such as multi-beam for multiple user, dual-polarization, or even complete phased arrays with enormous degrees of freedom in beamforming are some of the key research lines for antenna designers nowadays. In this article an overview of a new type of family of low-loss antennas and components based on the recently developed gap waveguide technology is presented. With the advent of new millimeter-wave applications, this low-cost and low-loss waveguide technology can be considered as a good candidate to be used as the core RF building block.",

With abundant access points, each with communication, computation, and storage resources, the UDN brings unprecedented benefits, including significant improvement in network spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, greatly reduced latency to enable novel mobile applications, and the capability of providing massive access for Internet of Things devices. However, such great promise comes with formidable research challenges. To design and operate such complex networks with various types of resources, efficient and innovative methodologies will be needed. This motivates the recent introduction of highly structured and generalizable models for network optimization. In this article, we present some recently proposed large-scale sparse and low-rank frameworks for optimizing UDNs, supported by various motivating applications. Special attention is paid to algorithmic approaches to deal with nonconvex objective functions and constraints, as well as computational scalability.",

In this article, we introduce mobile edge computing into virtualized cellular networks with M2M communications to decrease energy consumption and optimize computing resource allocation. Moreover, based on different functions and QoS requirements, the physical network can be virtualized into several virtual networks; then each MTCD selects the corresponding virtual network to access through the embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM) technology. Meanwhile, the random access process of MTCDs is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process to minimize the system cost, which consists of both energy consumption and execution time of computing tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the network architecture integration, software-defined networking is introduced to deal with the diverse protocols and standards in M2M networks. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.",

      "abstract": "Traffic offloading through small cells has been considered as a promising approach to accommodate tremendous traffic growth in future heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). The dense deployment of small cells, however, has led to a growing concern about the excessive carbon- based on-grid energy consumption in HCNs. In this article, we first overview the green-oriented traffic offloading in future HCNs that exploits the recent advanced energy technologies including energy harvesting (EH), local energy sharing (ES) enabled by smart grid, and wireless power transfer (WPT). We then discuss the challenges in resource management when exploiting EH, ES, and WPT to support traffic offloading, and provide possible solutions, especially by using the emerging dual connectivity (DC) in recent 3GPP specifications. Furthermore, we present a case study on the optimal DC-enabled traffic offloading through small cells that are powered by EH, with the objective of minimizing the total on-grid power consumption of all small cells and macrocells. The case study validates the benefit of exploiting the DC feature for traffic scheduling and the harvested energy to reduce the total on-grid power consumption. We finally share our view of some research directions in the green-oriented traffic offloading in HCNs.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, a number of frameworks started to appear that implement, directly in userspace with kernel-bypass mode, high-speed software data plane functionalities on commodity hardware. Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is one of such frameworks, representing an interesting point in the design space in that it offers, in userspace networking, the flexibility of a modular router (Click and variants), with the benefits provided by techniques such as batch processing that have become commonplace in high-speed networking stacks (such as netmap or DPDK). Similarly to Click, VPP lets users arrange functions as a processing graph, providing a full-blown stack of network functions. However, unlike Click, where the whole tree is traversed for each packet, in VPP each traversed node processes all packets in the batch (called vector) before moving to the next node. This design choice enables several code optimizations that greatly improve the achievable processing throughput. This article introduces the main VPP concepts and architecture, and experimentally evaluates the impact of design choices (such as batch packet processing) on performance.",

In this article, architectures and applications of 5G network slicing to HST are described. In addition, both higher layer and physical layer technologies are proposed to improve the quality of train communication in a 5G system. End-to-end network slicing that penetrates both the core network and radio access network can meet various performance requirements for 5G HST use cases, thanks to the flexibility offered by the proposed technologies. The higher layer technologies proposed in this article cover initial access, mobility management, and linear cell designs. Following the descriptions of evaluation parameters for the HST scenario adopted in 3GPP, the proposed physical layer technologies for HST applications including numerology and reference signal designs are explained. Link-level evaluation results are shown to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.",

      "abstract": "The emerging trend to softwarize networks based on concepts such as Network Virtualization, Software Defined Networking and Network Functions Virtualization promises to increase flexibility in networking. So far, flexibility is used rather as a qualitative argument for a network design choice. Furthermore, the meaning of flexibility behind such qualitative arguments is highly varying in the state of the art as a common understanding of flexibility is missing. In this article, we present an approach toward evaluating network flexibility through a definition of a flexibility measure, which provides a quantitative analysis and a comparison of different network designs. For us, network flexibility refers to the ability to support new requests that can be, for example, changes in the requirements or new traffic distributions. We show with two case studies, how an application of such measure could lead to a better understanding of different network designs with respect to flexibility. We also illustrate the trade-off between flexibility and cost needed to provide flexibility. With our proposed flexibility measure, we would like to stimulate the discussion toward a more quantitative analysis of softwarized networks and beyond.",

      "abstract": "The MEC vision leverages the availability of powerful and low-cost middleboxes, statically deployed at suitable edges of the network and acting as local proxies for the centralized cloud backbone; this potentially enables, among other things, better scalability and better reactivity in the interaction with mobile nodes via local control decisions and actuation. MEC has already been proposed as an enabler for several Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems application scenarios, and also mutual benefits due to the integration of MEC and mobile crowdsensing (MCS). The article originally proposes human-driven edge computing (HEC) as a new model to ease the provisioning and to extend the coverage of traditional MEC solutions. From a methodological perspective, we show how it is possible to exploit MCS i) to support the effective deployment of fixed MEC (FMEC) proxies and ii) to further extend their coverage through the introduction of impromptu and human-enabled mobile MEC (M2EC) proxies. In addition, we describe how we have implemented these novel concepts in the MCS ParticipAct platform through the integration of the MEC Elijah platform in the ParticipAct living lab, an ongoing MCS real-world experiment that involved about 170 students at the University of Bologna for more than two years. Reported experimental results quantitatively show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in elastically scaling the load at edge nodes according to runtime provisioning needs.",

      "abstract": "The comprehensive evolution of information communication technologies on mobile sensing objects has led to the provision of versatile ubiquitous network services embedded with specific- purpose modern sensors and intelligent wearable devices. The universal Internet connectivity of such smart objects has brought about a new era of ubiquitous application development for the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, security has become critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training) data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply machinelearning- based techniques to derive a user's plantar bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's notice.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a critical technology that allows diverse systems to rapidly adjust spectrum assignments and share spectrum with each other. This greatly improves overall spectrum efficiency at a time when demands for spectrum are rapidly increasing. Wireless services that use DSA or spectrum sharing mechanisms require a well-defined means to communicate how each device or system is using spectrum resources in a particular situation or at a specific location. Spectrum consumption models (SCMs) address this requirement by providing a means to capture the spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics of spectrum usage for any specific wireless transmitter, receiver, system, or collection of systems. The 1900.5 Working Group of the IEEE Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks Standardization Committee (DySPAN-SC) has written the IEEE 1900.5.2 standard, which defines a data model for SCMs and procedures to arbitrate compatibility among combinations of RF devices and/or spectrum-dependent systems that have expressed the boundaries of their spectrum use with SCMs. This article provides an overview of the IEEE 1900.5.2 standard using example use cases to illustrate how SCMs can enable a wide variety of efficient spectrum use interactions. Additionally, the article provides a brief description of an open source software tool to facilitate and promote the use of SCMs.",

      "abstract": "Various measurements and studies have shown that some licensed frequency bands are underutilized at certain times and in certain locations. In particular, TV bands have been shown to have unused spectrum. Such observations have triggered strong interest in white space dynamic spectrum access among researchers, wireless equipment manufacturers, and standards development organizations. The IEEE Standards Committee on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks created the White Space Radio Working Group in June 2011 to develop the IEEE 1900.7 standard for white space dynamic spectrum access radio systems. The standard was published in February 2016. This article gives an overview of key concepts and technologies of the IEEE 1900.7 standard, including use cases and requirements, the physical layer, and the MAC sublayer.",

      "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence, IoT, and high-performance computing, modern vehicles are becoming more and more connected and autonomous, which is deeply dependent on wireless communications for information exchange and sharing between the vehicle and the surrounding environment. IEEE 802.11p is a standard protocol designed for low latency and high mobility of vehicular communications. However, the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) of 802.11p with static access category queue allocation and fixed backoff parameter setting cannot meet the requirement of efficient vehicular channel access. In light of this, we improve EDCA by prioritizing messages and adjusting backoff window values dynamically to guarantee the timely delivery of real-time messages. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism has higher throughput and lower transmission delay for efficient vehicular communications.",

      "abstract": "Smart healthcare, instead of traditional healthcare, has attracted tremendous attention all over the world, and calls for integrated design bringing together interdisciplinary technological approaches and solutions with the aim of supporting affordable and high-quality patient care. With the increasing number of visually impaired people, including the blind, the elderly, and patients with eye diseases, it is vital to help them explore their outside environment with the assistance of smart technologies so that they can adapt to the environment more easily. The smart indoor anti-collision system is one typical application. Previous works normally use video monitors or deployed sensors to provide outside environment information for visually impaired people. However, these methods suffer from privacy disclosure and inconvenience. In this article, we present IAAS, a smart indoor anti-collision system based on RFID, which identifies and tracks passive RFID tags by analyzing the received backscatter signals. We extract RSSI based on the LWLR algorithm and phase profiles as fingerprints to help the user guide from obstacles without observations of eyes. Experiments are conducted to verify our system, and results show that IAAS could achieve high accuracy of 94 percent in obstacle avoidance.",

      "abstract": "5G radio access networks are expected to provide very high capacity, ultra-reliability and low latency, seamless mobility, and ubiquitous end-user experience anywhere and anytime. Driven by such stringent service requirements coupled with the expected dense deployments and diverse use case scenarios, the architecture of 5G New Radio (NR) wireless access has further evolved from the traditionally cell-centric radio access to a more flexible beam-based user-centric radio access. This article provides an overview of the NR system multi-beam operation in terms of initial access procedures and mechanisms associated with synchronization, system information, and random access. We further discuss inter-cell mobility handling in NR and its reliance on new downlink-based measurements to compensate for a lack of always-on reference signals in NR. Furthermore, we describe some of the user-centric coordinated transmission mechanisms envisioned in NR in order to realize seamless intra/inter-cell handover between physical transmission and reception points and reduce the interference levels across the network.",

      "abstract": "Current forecasts predict that the Industrial Internet of Things will account for about 10 billion devices by 2020. Simultaneously, unlicensed low-power wide area networks are gaining momentum due to their low cost, low power, and long range characteristics, which are suitable for many IIoT applications, in addition to the usage of unlicensed bands. In this article, a solution is proposed to seamlessly integrate LoRaWAN, an open and standardized LPWAN technology, with 4G/5G mobile networks, thus allowing mobile network operators to reutilize their current infrastructures. This proposal is transparent to LoRaWAN end devices and to the EPC, since only the LoRaWAN gateway needs to be modified. The gateway acts as an evolved Node B from the core network perspective, implementing part of the eNB protocol stack. All data packets transported over the core network are both encrypted and integrity protected, hence achieving end-toend security. As a proof of concept, this solution has been implemented and validated with an open source EPC.",

To achieve the above requirements, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) is required to make efficient decisions based on the massive data generated by the large number of IoT devices. AI methods analyze the data to extract patterns and make sense of the data to prescribe action to the end devices. In this work, we first give an overview, discussing the challenges and relevant solutions of the 5G and IoT technologies including the IoT-based 5G enabling technologies. We discuss the need for AI in future IoT-based 5G networks from the perspective of Kipling's method. In addition, we review the intelligent use of spectrum through full duplex and cognitive radio technologies.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities are systematically promoting the transition to sustainable and effective energy systems by promoting policies for energy efficiency, regionalized/distributed renewable energy generation, and intelligent energy management. In particular, this transition toward a more integrated and intelligent energy supply has created a plethora of energy meta-information made available through the IoT smart grid, thereby allowing big data analytical services to forecast energy consumption and to manage usage patterns. In this article, we propose a context-aware framework for intelligent power equipment management. Our contribution is to present a design of the proposed framework based on context awareness, the definition of a context ontology for power equipment management, a specification of the inference rules for the context ontology, and a context-aware inference service for power equipment management. The proposed system has broad applications to handle system monitoring and express system controls, so as to be easily and effectively applied to various application domains.",

      "abstract": "Smart Communities demand a huge amount of data to monitor different human activities. Until now, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have provided these data with a low cost and low intelligence networks. However, the constraints and the required baseline performance of WSNs have increased exponentially, and there is a lack of a global proposal to satisfy the demand of Smart Communities. There are several approaches regarding efficient WSN deployments to maximize network lifetime and performance. The vast majority of those proposals try to separately address several inherent constraints and limitations related to energy and node lifetime. In fact, they typically provide efficient management approaches based on existing solutions, but they do not propose new tools or algorithms to afford them. To tackle this problem in a global manner, we introduce the concept of intelligent WSNs. In order to outfit the WSN with a huge amount of possibilities to route and control the different nodes, our nodes incorporate the possibility of transmitting and receiving signals from/to several nodes jointly through beamforming. In our approach, this latter technique is intelligently applied to allow the deployment of new WSNs to be able to react and to adapt its features depending on the environmental conditions, maintaining QoS and enlarging network lifetime. This is the main goal of our proposal.",

Since the very first experiment on an American Wonder by Francis P Houdina in 1925, autonomous driving has attracted intensive research interest from standards organizations, industry, as well as academia. In this article, we first present an overview of the current progress and achievements, then envision the future evolution directions of autonomous driving systems. Besides describing the representative functional modules, we also discuss the critical enabling technologies, and identify the security concerns and corresponding countermeasures.",

      "abstract": "Network functions virtualization and cloudbased security services will become increasingly common in enterprise network systems to reduce the system operation costs and take advantage of the diverse network security functions (NSFs) developed by multiple vendors. In such a network environment, standardizing the interfaces to the NSFs of different vendors is essential to simplify the management of these heterogeneous NSFs. In addition, software-defined networking can be imposed to optimize the security service process in such cloud-based service environments by enforcing some types of packet filtering rules at the SDN switches, instead of NSFs possibly placed in remote clouds. The Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) Working Group, which is part of the Internet Engineering Task Force, is currently developing a set of standard interfaces to such heterogeneous NSFs. In this article, we present the design and development of an I2NSF architecture and propose improving its efficiency by integrating it with SDN. In our work, we implement the SDN-integrated I2NSF architecture and its security applications. This article also discusses several standardization and research challenges for I2NSF.",

      "abstract": "Research efforts in vehicular communication networks have been driven by the need to achieve high data rates for value-added services and safety applications. The proliferation of billions of connected devices along with their ever growing data demands can potentially cause severe congestion in vehicular networks unless effective solutions are developed. In this context, the multiuser interference encountered in vehicular ad hoc networks is a major performance bottleneck. The interference among vehicles needs to be harnessed to meet the high data rate requirements of heterogeneous vehicular communication networks. This work proposes a novel paradigm of interference-aided vehicular networks in which the interference signals are exploited for communication-related operations such as message flooding, energy harvesting, channel estimation, signal alignment, and link security. We also highlight the technical and socio-economic challenges that must be addressed for successful implementation of interference- aided vehicular communication networks.",

      "abstract": "Advancements in computing, communication, and sensing technologies are making it possible to embed, control, and gather vital information from tiny devices that are being deployed and utilized in practically every aspect of our modernized society. From smart home appliances to municipal water and electric industrial facilities to our everyday work environments, the next Internet frontier, dubbed IoT, is promising to revolutionize our lives and tackle some of our nations' most pressing challenges. While the seamless interconnection of IoT devices with the physical realm is envisioned to bring a plethora of critical improvements in many aspects and diverse domains, it will undoubtedly pave the way for attackers that will target and exploit such devices, threatening the integrity of their data and the reliability of critical infrastructure. Further, such compromised devices will undeniably be leveraged as the next generation of botnets, given their increased processing capabilities and abundant bandwidth. While several demonstrations exist in the literature describing the exploitation procedures of a number of IoT devices, the up-to-date inference, characterization, and analysis of unsolicited IoT devices that are currently deployed \"in the wild\" is still in its infancy. In this article, we address this imperative task by leveraging active and passive measurements to report on unsolicited Internet-scale IoT devices. This work describes a first step toward exploring the utilization of passive measurements in combination with the results of active measurements to shed light on the Internet-scale insecurities of the IoT paradigm. By correlating results of Internet-wide scanning with Internet background radiation traffic, we disclose close to 14,000 compromised IoT devices in diverse sectors, including critical infrastructure and smart home appliances. To this end, we also analyze their generated traffic to create effective mitigation signatures that could be deployed in local IoT realms. To support largescale empirical data analytics in the context of IoT, we make available the inferred and extracted IoT malicious raw data through an authenticated front-end service. The outcomes of this work confirm the existence of such compromised devices on an Internet scale, while the generated inferences and insights are postulated to be employed for inferring other similarly compromised IoT devices, in addition to contributing to IoT cyber security situational awareness.",

      "abstract": "Network virtualization and softwarizing network functions are trends aiming at higher network efficiency, cost reduction and agility. They are driven by the evolution in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This shows that software will play an increasingly important role within telecommunication services, which were previously dominated by hardware appliances. Service providers can benefit from this, as it enables faster introduction of new telecom services, combined with an agile set of possibilities to optimize and fine-tune their operations. However, the provided telecom services can only evolve if the adequate software tools are available. In this article, we explain how the development, deployment and maintenance of such an SDN/NFV-based telecom service puts specific requirements on the platform providing it. A Software Development Kit (SDK) is introduced, allowing service providers to adequately design, test and evaluate services before they are deployed in production and also update them during their lifetime. This continuous cycle between development and operations, a concept known as DevOps, is a well known strategy in software development. To extend its context further to SDN/NFV-based services, the functionalities provided by traditional cloud platforms are not yet sufficient. By giving an overview of the currently available tools and their limitations, the gaps in DevOps for SDN/NFV services are highlighted. The benefit of such an SDK is illustrated by a secure content delivery network service (enhanced with deep packet inspection and elastic routing capabilities). With this use-case, the dynamics between developing and deploying a service are further illustrated.",

      "abstract": "Upstream data rate constraints have long been the Achilles' heel of hybrid fiber-coaxial networks. Increasingly, cable operators face the challenge of growing demand for cloud services, symmetric services for small and medium enterprises, high definition video uploads, real-time gaming, live streaming video, and virtual or augmented reality. In this article, we discuss future HFC network architectures and system concepts that remove the restrictions on asymmetry ratio, preparing HFC networks for the anticipated growth in demand for symmetric services. The concepts detailed in this article allow multiple system operators to offer fiber-like symmetric services without the need to install fiber all the way to the home. We demonstrate that 10 Gb/s symmetric data rates are feasible with a proof-of-concept prototype system. It is achieved by enabling full duplex transmission through extremely wideband echo cancellation and effectively eliminates the extra interference that full duplex operation introduces in the shared network. This technology can be made compatible with legacy DOCSIS networks and validates Cable- Labs' Full Duplex DOCSIS 3.1 proposal.",

      "abstract": "Our interactions with the world are increasingly dependent on context-aware services, and the future of smart cities is coupled with how efficiently and reliably we can deliver these services to end users. In this article we present the premise of personalized IoT systems, by leveraging novel advancements in user-centric technologies under the fog computing architecture. This means leveraging the connectivity and processing potential of the fog to bring IoT control and analytics closer to the user, and improve the coupling of services with local IoT components in user-centric contexts. The potential gain in access latency and context-sensitive service matching will enable a multitude of smart city services. On one hand, data management (collection, pruning, denaturing [1], and encryption) can take place closer to the edge, thereby leveraging network load and service times. On the other hand, service matching in smart city applications will witness higher responsiveness and resource visibility in areas with intermittent connectivity or high mobility. We first present the challenges in migrating cloud-IoT architectures to the network edge, and detail the hindrances in transitioning the control and management of IoT systems to the user end. As a remedy, we survey recent advancements in the IoT, ubiquitous computing, and user-centric services, which enable us to advance personalized IoT architectures. We finally present a framework for IoT in the fog to synergize these advancements, and present a proof-of-concept use case to highlight its utility and impact. We conclude this article with prime directions for future work to realize a personalized IoT architecture, and highlight the potential gain in prioritizing five high-yield potential research issues.",

      "abstract": "The use of amateur drones is expected to significantly increase over the upcoming years. However, regulations do not allow such drones to fly over all areas, in addition to typical altitude limitations. As a result, there is an urgent need for amateur drone surveillance solutions. These solutions should include means of accurate detection, classification, and localization of the unwanted drones in a no-fly zone. In this article, we give an overview of promising techniques for modulation classification and signal-strength-based localization of amateur drones by using surveillance drones. By introducing a generic altitude-dependent propagation model, we show how detection and localization performance depend on the altitude of surveillance drones. Particularly, our simulation results show a 25 dB reduction in the minimum detectable power or 10 times coverage enhancement of a surveillance drone by flying at the optimum altitude. Moreover, for a target no-fly zone, the location estimation error of an amateur drone can be remarkably reduced by optimizing the positions of the surveillance drones. Finally, we conclude the article with a general discussion about the future work and possible challenges in aerial surveillance systems.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter-wave communications have been recently proposed as a promising candidate to fulfill the connectivity requisites imposed over autonomous driving. The need for transmission capabilities of multiple gigabits per second for autonomous vehicles is the main driving factor for millimeter-wave technology. However, there are other paramount requirements, such as short delays, high reliability, security, and support for both unicast and broadcast communications, which must be carefully addressed before this technology becomes a reality. In this article we first review the state-of-the art modeling frameworks that are being considered for vehicular communications. Then we explore the key technologies that will enhance the suitability of millimeter-wave communications for autonomous driving, and we investigate the main challenges that need to be overcome. Finally, we envision that a combination of analog/ hybrid beamforming with a location-based beam search protocol, using full duplex radio and physical layer key generation, has the potential of fulfilling the requirements of autonomous driving technology.",

      "abstract": "Optimization of end-to-end service provisioning across multi-domain EONs is critically important due to the restricted intra-domain visibility and the agile spectrum allocation mechanism of EONs. Previously demonstrated schemes apply fixed service provisioning policies (e.g., heuristic routing and spectrum assignment and threshold- based anomaly detection) and fail to fully address the inherent principle and dynamic conditions of multi-domain EONs. This article brings in data analytics and presents a knowledge-based autonomous service provisioning framework for multi-domain EONs. The proposed framework employs a new broker plane working with domain managers while supporting the autonomy of each management domain. This can be seen as a hierarchical multi-domain network control and management architecture in support of enhanced resource efficiency and network scalability where each hierarchy employs an observe-analyze-act cycle. Specifically, the broker and domain managers can observe the network state through comprehensive network monitoring (monitoring of optical paths' performance, resource utilization, and traffic dynamics), analyze the network behavior and form the knowledge repository of network rules using machine learning techniques, and act intelligently according to the obtained knowledge. We assess the proposed framework by evaluating two key knowledge-based service provisioning use cases: proactive inter-domain traffic-prediction- based autonomous traffic engineering and quality-of-transmission-aware inter-domain lightpath provisioning. Numerical results demonstrate remarkable benefits of the proposed framework over conventional solutions.",

Although there are several existing works about MEC, for example, utilizing WNV and SDN, virtualized D2D communication together with learning-based D2D communication systems, such as social and smart D2D networking systems, have not been investigated by researchers, while knowledge of the edge is lacking. In this article, we introduce an innovative framework, called KCE, to dynamically detect network structure and manage communication resources, leveraging the insightful knowledge obtained from D2D communications among mobile users. Further, to support trustworthy network access and to meet different QoS requirements in the proposed architecture, specific SPs are selected from InPs by a KCE server. As such, the chosen SPs' resources can be dynamically allocated to meet various service requirements by virtualized D2D communication techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different scenarios and parameter settings.",

      "abstract": "The specification of 5G mobile and wireless communications is progressing at a rapid pace, where the early drop non-standalone version was already completed in December 2017 by 3GPP. 5G aims not only at mere performance enhancement relative to previous generations but also to be a key enabler for different services and business operations known as vertical industries. To this end, on one hand, 5G incorporates the framework of network slicing as a flexible and future-proof means to support vertical industries on a common infrastructure. On the other hand, 5G extends the notion of a conventional radio resource toward a native use of other available resources, namely, the unlicensed spectrum (varying from 1 to 100 GHz) in an LAA way, to respond to stringent and diverse service requirements. This article places the aforementioned key 5G features in focus, and proposes a new framework, namely LAA as a service, which aims to provide different LAA configurations to be used on demand in a service-oriented manner. First, the 3GPP standardization roadmap is presented, focusing on the challenges that need to be taken into consideration in order to allow for opportunistic complementary unlicensed spectrum usage for 5G assuming very demanding 5G services in terms of key performance indicators such as latency and reliability. The LAA configurations can be seen as different RAN configuration modes, that is, the RAN part of the end-to-end (E2E) network slice. Furthermore, as a particular 5G case study, a very dynamic and interference-limited scenario, which is a 5G ultra-dense network scenario with unplanned/dynamic small cells, is exemplified to show that dynamic radio topology coupled with LAA as a service is a promising and complementary enhancement.",

      "abstract": "With the evolution of the Internet of Things, mutual sharing of information becomes easy among various smart devices across the globe. In such an environment, smart healthcare also needs to be expedited with an aim to provide remote diagnosis to patients located across the globe. However, as the sensitive information about a patient travels using an open channel (i.e., the Internet), there are chances of misusing this information. Hence, there is a requirement for a strong crypto mechanism for securely processing smart healthcare data. Most of the solutions reported in the literature use heavy computation-based solutions for providing security to smart healthcare data, which may not be suitable in view of less resources for modern smart devices. In this article, we propose a novel lattice-based secure cryptosystem for smart healthcare (LSCSH) in future smart cities. LSCSH uses a lightweight key exchange and an authentication mechanism at several stages. The proposed scheme has been evaluated with respect to the communication and computation costs in comparison to the other competitive schemes. The results obtained prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme in comparison to the existing schemes.",

This free, unlicensed band has drawn considerable attention from academia and cellular operators worldwide. Several standards are being developed for flexible integration, aggregation, and interworking of this unlicensed band with licensed networks or spectrum. Of many candidate approaches, in this article, we introduce LTE WLAN aggregation (LWA). LWA, capable of leveraging the LTE and WLAN spectra simultaneously, has emerged as a prominent solution to increase network capacity and enhanced end users' quality of experience. Further, we present latest advances in this exciting technology by reviewing the state-of-the-art LWA architecture, and identify several opportunities and open challenges related to LWA design for future research.",

Mobile fitness app usage data, which describes who works out at what time and place, provides a good opportunity to figure out these key factors that influence human workout activities. This article investigates the mobile fitness app usage data from more than 14,000 cellular towers and 4000 users. Based on solid analysis, we find that temporal factors, such as the day of the week and the time of day, affect human workout activities, while location is another key factor. In addition, mobility factors, such as moving range and regularity of mobility, also influence human workout activities. Finally, personal income is another fundamental factor that we find influences human workout activities.",

      "abstract": "The terahertz band, 0.1-10 THz, has sufficient resources not only to satisfy the 5G requirements of 10 Gb/s peak data rate but to enable a number of tempting rate-greedy applications. However, the terahertz band brings novel challenges, never addressed at lower frequencies. Among others, the scattering of terahertz waves from any object, including walls and furniture, and ultra-wideband highly directional links lead to fundamentally new propagation and interference structures. In this article, we review the recent progress in terahertz propagation modeling, and antenna and testbed designs, and propose a step-by-step roadmap for wireless terahertz Ethernet extension for indoor environments. As a side effect, the described concept provides a second life to the currently underutilized Ethernet infrastructure by using it as a universally available backbone. By applying real terahertz band propagation, reflection, and scattering measurements as well as ray-tracing simulations of a typical office, we analyze two representative scenarios at 300 GHz and 1.25 THz frequencies, illustrating that extremely high rates can be achieved with realistic system parameters at room scales.",

Layered-division-multiplexing (LDM) is a novel non-orthogonal multiplexing technology recently adopted by the next generation digital TV broadcast system, ATSC 3.0, which is capable of providing significant capacity improvement when delivering multiple broadcast services simultaneously. This article explores the application of LDM as an enabling technology for 5G to achieve high-efficiency P2MP transmission and to deliver more diversified broadcast-type services using the mobile broadband infrastructure. The potential advantages that can be offered by LDM are demonstrated by capacity analysis and computer simulations. Coverage studies show that a 5G P2MP subsystem with LDM can deliver high-quality broadcast services using the broadband infrastructure. Finally, some general guidelines on the receiver implementation are presented to minimize the hardware complexity of consumer devices.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) provides adequate information for recognizing and analyzing human activities. Because of the short distance and low transmit power of Wi-Fi communications, people usually deploy multiple access points (APs) in a small area. Traditional Wi-Fi CSI-based human activity recognition methods adopt Wi-Fi CSI from a single AP, which is not very appropriate for a high-density Wi-Fi environment. In this article, we propose a learning method that analyzes the CSI of multiple APs in a small area to detect and recognize human activities. We introduce a deep learning model to process complex and large CSI from multiple APs. From extensive experiment results, our method performs better than other solutions in a given environment where multiple Wi-Fi APs exist.",

      "abstract": "In the fifth generation (5G) of mobile broadband systems, radio resource management (RRM) will reach unprecedented levels of complexity. To cope with the ever more sophisticated RRM functionalities and the growing variety of scenarios, while carrying out the prompt decisions required in 5G, this manuscript presents a lean RRM architecture that capitalizes on recent advances in the field of machine learning in combination with the large amount of data readily available in the network from measurements and system observations. The architecture consists of a learner (or a few), which learns RRM policies directly from the data gathered in the network using a single general-purpose learning framework, and a set of distributed actors, which execute RRM policies issued by the learner and repeatedly generate samples of experience. Thus, the complexity of RRM is shifted to the design of the learning framework, while the RRM algorithms derived from this framework are executed in a computationally efficient distributed manner at the radio access nodes. The potential of this approach is verified in a pair of pertinent scenarios, and future directions on applications of machine learning to RRM are discussed. Although we focus on a mobile broadband context, the concepts proposed hereafter extend to any radio access network technology where one can conceive the idea of a central learning unit gathering data from distributed actors.",

      "abstract": "Here, we explain the principles of operating lens antennas, and discuss their potential application for future 5G communications systems. We discuss the connection between the nomenclature employed in the optics and microwave communities, such as the direct relationship between aberrations and directivity and side lobe levels. Furthermore, we explain the potential of two innovative techniques: transformation optics and metasurfaces. Transformation optics, and specifically the concept of bespoke lenses, can be employed to make lenses ad hoc for specific feedings. Metasurfaces can be employed to produce two-dimensional low-cost lenses that can be fully metallic, which is an advantage in terms of losses. Finally, we introduce the concept of higher symmetries that can be used to increase the bandwidth of operation of these metasurfaces lenses.",

      "abstract": "The evolution and sophistication of cyber-attacks need resilient and evolving cybersecurity schemes. As an emerging technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) inherits cyber-attacks and threats from the IT environment despite the existence of a layered defensive security mechanism. The extension of the digital world to the physical environment of IoT brings unseen attacks that require a novel lightweight and distributed attack detection mechanism due to their architecture and resource constraints. Architecturally, fog nodes can be leveraged to offload security functions from IoT and the cloud to mitigate the resource limitation issues of IoT and scalability bottlenecks of the cloud. Classical machine learning algorithms have been extensively used for intrusion detection, although scalability, feature engineering efforts, and accuracy have hindered their penetration into the security market. These shortcomings could be mitigated using the deep learning approach as it has been successful in big data fields. Apart from eliminating the need to craft features manually, deep learning is resilient against morphing attacks with high detection accuracy. This article proposes an LSTM network for distributed cyber-attack detection in fog-to-things communication. We identify and analyze critical attacks and threats targeting IoT devices, especially attacks exploiting vulnerabilities of wireless communications. The conducted experiments on two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of deeper models over traditional machine learning models.",

      "abstract": "Big data are a key enabler for smart cities and local communities willing to offer more tailored services and resources to citizens. One of the biggest challenges in a long-running big data platform for smarter cities lies in the real capacity not only to drill into the data, but also, and most importantly, to leverage existing social and geographical ties between all main actors of local communities, which range from normal citizens and people to economy stakeholders, non-profit and social organizations, and government and administrative staff. The platform should let them use (and disclose) among themselves those pieces of information they do not want to publish globally (e.g., on Facebook and Google), but would be willing to share and interweave locally (e.g., through an easy-to-use community portal). In addition, if the advent of Web 2.0 technologies simplified both the consumption and the production of new contents (e.g., through highly interactive wiki-like pages), they considerably enable additive services. A notable example is the metering of the digital footprint and traces left by users as they interact with these platforms, useful to further enhance the user experience by providing automatically adapted mashups of local community services/data. We describe how to exploit these socio-technical aspects by integrating them in a new semantic-enabled big data platform specifically designed for the local community smart city scenario called LocalFocus. The article also reports some experimental results collected with a first in-the-field deployment of the LocalFocus in Imola, namely, the ImolaInRete community portal, which has already involved more than 800 citizens since its launch in January 2017.",

      "abstract": "Localization and energy efficiency is very important for UAVs. In this work, we propose a new mechanism for data routing based on localization in GPS-denied or GPS-challenged areas. The proposed mechanism relies on a weighted centroid localization technique, where the position of unknown UAV nodes are calculated using fuzzy logic. The UAV nodes are organized into clusters. The proposed localization algorithm first localizes the UAVs, then elects the next cluster head in order to minimize the energy consumption of the whole network and consequently increase its lifetime. Evaluation of the proposal shows that it is more efficient than the existing solutions in terms of energy consumption, localization accuracy, localization time, and data transmission.",

      "abstract": "mmWave MIMO with large antenna array has attracted considerable interest from the academic and industry communities, as it can provide larger bandwidth and higher spectrum efficiency. However, with hundreds of antennas, the number of RF chains required by mmWave MIMO is also huge, leading to unaffordable hardware cost and power consumption in practice. In this article, we investigate low RF-complexity technologies to solve this bottleneck. We first review the evolution of low RF-complexity technologies from microwave frequencies to mmWave frequencies. Then, we discuss two promising low RF-complexity technologies for mmWave MIMO systems in detail, that is PAHP and LAHP, including their principles, advantages, challenges, and recent results. We compare the performance of these two technologies to draw some insights about how they can be deployed in practice. Finally, we conclude this article and point out some future research directions in this area.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a low-cost solution for developing tracking antennas in millimeter-wave bands. Specifically, the objective is to design an antenna that simultaneously generates sum and difference patterns at W band for 5G point-topoint communications. To this end, the use of radial line slot array (RLSA) antennas with a 3D-printable feeding structure based on a new technology known as gap-waveguide is proposed. The feeding structure is located below the ground plane of the RLSA, and it consists of a Butler matrix finished in a circular cavity that couples to the RLSA, simultaneously generating the sum and difference patterns. This technique combines a sum beam and a difference beam to accurately determine the direction of arrival of the signal. It can be used for point-to-point communications, ensuring precise tracking and a stable connection. Simulations show good behavior of both the feeding structure and the RLSA antenna, with stable sum and difference patterns.",

      "abstract": "The heterogeneous network (HetNet) is a key enabler to largely boost network coverage and capacity in the forthcoming 5G and beyond. To support the explosively growing mobile data volumes, wireless communications with millimeter- wave (mmWave) radios have attracted massive attention, and is widely considered as a promising candidate in 5G HetNets. In this article, we give an overview on the end-to-end latency of HetNets with mmWave communications. In general, it is rather challenging to formulate and optimize the delay problem with buffers in mmWave communications, since conventional graph-based network optimization techniques are not applicable when queues are considered. Toward this end, we develop an adaptive low-latency strategy, which uses cooperative networking to reduce the end-to-end latency. Then we evaluate the performance of the introduced strategy. Results reveal the importance of proper cooperative networking in reducing the end-toend latency. In addition, we have identified several challenges in future research for low-latency mmWave HetNets.",

In spite of their alleged benefits to materialize user-initiated, ad hoc dedicated end-to-end circuits for high-demanding applications, DCNs also pose important challenges. Two examples are dealing with the end-user's lack of ability or willingness to understand low-level technicalities of virtual circuit establishment, and accommodating NRENs' local policies throughout the life-cycle of DCN. In this article, we seek to improve the usability of DCN services with a focus on the inexperienced end-user and the skilled network operator alike. We introduce MEICAN, a platform to manage the life-cycle of DCN from definition to provisioning of virtual circuits. We also present a case study of inter-domain circuit reservation with mixed manual and automated policy checking, and discuss lessons learned, relevant challenges, and open issues still to be overcome.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, a significant amount of effort has been invested on architecting agile and adaptive management solutions in support of autonomic, self-managing networks. Autonomic networking calls for automated decisions for management actions. This can be realized through a set of pre-defined network management policies engineered from human expert knowledge. However, engineering sufficiently accurate knowledge considering the high complexity of today's networking environment is a difficult task. This has been a particularly limiting factor in the practical deployment of autonomic systems. ML is a powerful technique for extracting knowledge from data. However, there has been little evidence of its application in realizing practical management solutions for autonomic networks. Recent advances in network softwarization and programmability through SDN and NFV, the proliferation of new sources of data, and the availability of lowcost and seemingly infinite storage and compute resource from the cloud are paving the way for the adoption of ML to realize cognitive network management in support of autonomic networking. This article is intended to stimulate thought and foster discussion on how to defeat the bottlenecks that are limiting the wide deployment of autonomic systems, and the role that ML can play in this regard.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the demand for wireless mobile services is copious and will continue increasing in the near future. Mobile cellular operators are therefore looking at the unlicensed spectrum as an economical supplement to augment the capacity of their soon-to-be overloaded networks. The same unlicensed bands are luring Internet service providers, venue owners, and authorities into autonomously setting up and managing their high-performance private networks. In light of this exciting future, enhancing the coexistence between multiple unlicensed technologies becomes a pivotal issue. In this article, we present the fundamentals and the main challenges behind massive MIMO unlicensed, a new approach for technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, that is envisioned to boost spectrum reuse for a plethora of use cases.",

      "abstract": "Network latency and reliability are becoming critical performance indicators for future mission critical services based on wireless connectivity. In this article we present a portable and low-cost measurement framework for quantifying the endto- end (E2E) latency and reliability of communication systems based on single or multiple links. The proposed framework is tailored for characterization of access diversity mechanisms, for example, multi-connectivity or hybrid access methods, which are expected to be essential for ultra-reliable wireless communications in 4G and 5G networks. An active-probe measurement approach is adopted, consisting of a client that transmits timestamped packets to a server, and vice versa, via one or multiple communication links under test. The setup allows us to measure the one-way latency performance in uplink and downlink separately, and allows fully synchronized measurements of multiple links in parallel to understand the benefits of multi-connectivity mechanisms. Traffic generation is flexible in terms of packet size, transport protocol (TCP or UDP), and inter-arrival time interval of the generated packets, hence being a powerful tool for benchmarking the performance for different application-specific message flows. Special emphasis is put on the tail of the latency distribution, that is, the latency that can be achieved with a certain probability constraint, for example, 99.9 percent or beyond. Given the challenge of measuring such rare events, we measure and validate the stability of the measurement equipment to ensure that the observed performance is not compromised by undesired behavior or malfunction of the equipment. The system has a measurement error below 400 \u03bcs with 99.9 percent confidence and below 3.1 ms with 99.999 percent confidence. The capability and applicability of the measurement framework is illustrated by a measurement test of two simultaneous LTE connections that provide robust communications to an aerial drone.",

      "abstract": "After ECN was first added to IP in 2001, it was hit by a succession of deployment problems. Studies in recent years have concluded that path traversal of ECN has become close to universal. In this article, we test whether the performance enhancement called ECN++ will face a similar deployment struggle as did base ECN. For this, we assess the feasibility of ECN++ deployment over mobile as well as fixed networks. In the process, we discover bad news for the base ECN protocol: contrary to accepted beliefs, more than half the mobile carriers we tested wipe the ECN field at the first upstream hop. All packets still get through, and congestion control still functions, just without the benefits of ECN. This throws into question whether previous studies used representative vantage points. This article also reports the good news that, wherever ECN gets through, we found no deployment problems for the \"++\" enhancement to ECN. The article includes the results of other in-depth tests that check whether servers that claim to support ECN actually respond correctly to explicit congestion feedback. Those interested can access the raw measurement data online.",

      "abstract": "With the invention of new communication technologies, new features and facilities are provided in a smart healthcare framework. The features and facilities aim to provide a seamless, easy-to-use, accurate, and real-time healthcare service to clients. As health is a sensitive issue, it should be taken care of with utmost security and caution. This article proposes a new medical image forgery detection system for the healthcare framework to verify that images related to healthcare are not changed or altered. The system works on a noise map of an image, applies a multi-resolution regression filter on the noise map, and feeds the output to support-vector-machine-based and extreme-learning-based classifiers. The noise map is created in an edge computing resource, while the filtering and classification are done in a core cloud computing resource. In this way, the system works seamlessly and in real time. The bandwidth requirement of the proposed system is also reasonable.",

      "abstract": "Wireless on-chip communication is a promising candidate to address the performance and efficiency issues that arise when scaling current NoC techniques to manycore processors. A WNoC can serve global and broadcast traffic with ultra-low latency even in thousand-core chips, thus acting as a natural complement to conventional and throughput-oriented wireline NoCs. However, the development of MAC strategies needed to efficiently share the wireless medium among the increasing number of cores remains a considerable challenge given the singularities of the environment and the novelty of the research area. In this position article, we present a context analysis describing the physical constraints, performance objectives, and traffic characteristics of the on-chip communication paradigm. We summarize the main differences with respect to traditional wireless scenarios, and then discuss their implications on the design of MAC protocols for manycore WNoC, with the ultimate goal of kickstarting this arguably unexplored research area.",

      "abstract": "The exponential increase in wireless data transmission from smartphones has led to the saturation of the sub-6-GHz bands where cellular networks have operated to date forcing providers to migrate to the millimeter-wave (mmWave) regime for 5G. Although available channel bandwidths will grow from tens of megahertz to several gigahertz, propagation loss will be substantially higher. To compensate the link budget, phased array antennas with 20 dBi40-dBi gain will be employed at the base and mobile stations. Since beamwidth is inversely proportional to gain, the resultant pencilbeams will be only 315 wide and thus must be electronically steered to ensure that they are aligned between the stations. The high directionality of 5G systems will fundamentally change channel propagation models and channel sounding systems and techniques used to measure the model properties. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is on the forefront of defining that change. In this article, we provide an overview of mmWave channel sounding through three types of systems: switched array, virtual array, and phased array, at 28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 83 GHz. In addition, we describe how mmWave channel models, for path loss, dispersion, multipath tracking, Doppler spread, and blockage, differ from sub-6-GHz models, substantiated by some of our most recent results.",

      "abstract": "Millimeter-wave MIMO systems are one of the candidate schemes for 5G wireless standardization efforts. In this context, the main contributions of this article are three-fold. First, we describe parallel sets of measurements at identical transmit-receive location pairs with 2.9, 29 and 61 GHz carrier frequencies in indoor office, shopping mall, and outdoor settings. These measurements provide insights on propagation, blockage and material penetration losses, and the key elements necessary in system design to make mm-Wave systems viable in practice. Second, one of these elements is hybrid beamforming necessary for better link margins by reaping the array gain with large antenna dimensions. From the class of fully-flexible hybrid beamformers, we describe a robust class of directional beamformers toward meeting the high data-rate requirements of mm-Wave systems. Third, leveraging these design insights, we then describe an experimental prototype system at 28 GHz that realizes high data rates on both the downlink and uplink and robustly maintains these rates in outdoor and indoor mobility scenarios. In addition to maintaining large signal constellation sizes in spite of radio frequency challenges, this prototype leverages the directional nature of the mm-Wave channel to perform seamless beam switching and handover across mm-Wave base stations, thereby overcoming the path losses in non-line-of-sight links and blockages encountered at mm-Wave frequencies.",

      "abstract": "High-gain narrow-beam antennas or beamformed antenna arrays will likely be used in millimeter- wave (mmWave) bands and 5G to mitigate the high path loss. Since many multipath components may be excluded by the narrow beam, the mmWave radio channel (consisting of the transmit antenna, the propagation channels, and the receive antenna) strongly depends on the beamwidth, orientation, and shape of the narrow beam. In this article, a procedure is proposed to measure and model the channels vs. synthetic beamwidth. Based on experimental data collected at 60 GHz in an indoor hallway/lobby scenario, the results show that the number of multipath components and the delay dispersion of the channel are significantly reduced by the narrow beams. In addition, the path loss can be decreased by more than 20 dB with an optimized beam-center orientation. The impact of the study on future 5G mmWave system design is discussed, including frequency reuse, antenna design, receiver design, equalization, and link budget.",

      "abstract": "IoT, a heterogeneous interconnection of smart devices, is a great platform to develop novel mobile applications. Resource constrained smart devices, however, often become the bottlenecks to fully realize such developments, especially when it comes to intensive-computation-oriented and low-latency-demanding applications. MEC is a promising approach to address such challenges. In this article, we focus on MEC applications for IoT, and address energy efficiency as well as offloading performance of such applications in terms of end-user experience. In this regard, we present a mobility-aware hierarchical MEC framework for green and low-latency IoT. We deploy a game theoretic approach for computation offloading in order to optimize the utility of the service providers while also reducing the energy cost and the task execution time of the smart devices. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme does brings significant enhancement in both energy efficiency and latency performance of MEC applications for IoT.",

Big data analytics could enable the move from Internet of EVs, to optimized EV charging in smart transportation. In this article, we propose a MECbased system, in line with a big data-driven planning strategy, for CS charging. The GC as cloud server further facilitates analytics of big data, from CSs (service providers) and on-the-move EVs (mobile clients), to predict the charging availability of CSs. Mobility-aware MEC servers interact with opportunistically encountered EVs to disseminate CSs' predicted charging availability, collect EVs' driving big data, and implement decentralized computing on data mining and aggregation. The case study shows the benefits of the MEC-based system in terms of communication efficiency (with repeated monitoring of a traffic jam) concerning the long-term popularity of EVs.",

      "abstract": "The emerging real-time and computation-intensive services driven by the Internet of Things, augmented reality, automatic driving, and so on, have tight quality of service and quality of experience requirements, which can hardly be supported by conventional cloud computing. Fog computing, which migrates the features of cloud computing to the network edge, guarantees low latency for location-aware services. However, due to the locality feature of fog computing, maintaining service continuity when mobile users travel across different access networks has become a challenging issue. In this article, we propose a novel software-defined-networking-based fog computing architecture by decoupling mobility control and data forwarding. Under the proposed architecture, we design efficient signaling operations to provide seamless and transparent mobility support to mobile users, and present an efficient route optimization algorithm by considering the performance gain in data communications and system overhead in mobile fog computing. Numerical results from extensive simulations have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can not only guarantee service continuity, but also greatly improve handover performance and achieve high data communication efficiency in mobile fog computing.",

For CSI reporting, the modular design framework and high-resolution spatial information feedback offer not only flexibility in a host of use cases and deployment scenarios, but also improved average user throughput over state-of-the-art 4G LTE. To accommodate cellular communications in the milimeter-wave regime where a combination of analog and digital beamforming is typically used at both a base station and user equipment, beam management procedures such as measurement, reporting, and recovery are introduced. The utility and joint usage of these two features are demonstrated along with some potential upgrades for the next phase of 5G NR.",

      "abstract": "The automotive and telco industries have taken an investment bet on the connected car market, pushing for the digital transformation of the sector by exploiting recent information and communications technology (ICT) progress. As ICT developments continue, it is expected that the technology advancements will be able to fulfill the sophisticated requirements for vehicular use cases, such as: low latency and reliable communications for safety; increased computing power to process large amounts of sensed data; and increased bandwidth for onboard infotainment. The aforementioned requirements have received significant focus during the ongoing definition of the 3GPP 5G mobile standards, where there has been a drive to facilitate vertical segments such as automotive, in addition to providing the core aspects of the communication infrastructure. Among the technology enablers for 5G, multi-access edge computing (MEC) can be considered essential. That is, a cloud environment located at the edge of the network, in proximity of the end users and coupled with the service provider's network infrastructure. Even before 5G is rolled out, current mobile networks can already target support for these challenging use cases using MEC technology. This is because MEC is able to fulfill low latency and high bandwidth requirements, and, in addition, lends itself to be deployed at vertical industrial sector premises such as road infrastructure, air/seaports, and smart factories, thus bringing computing power where it is needed most. This work showcases the automotive use cases that are relevant for MEC, providing insights into the technologies specified and investigated by the ETSI Industry Specification Group MEC, who were the pioneers in creating a standardized computing platform for advanced mobile networks with regard to network edge related use cases.",

      "abstract": "Massive MIMO is one of the key enabling technologies in 5G wireless communications. A large number of antenna elements bring extra degrees of freedom for increasing the throughput and considerable beamforming gains for improving the coverage. In practice, a large number of antenna elements can be assembled into multiple antenna panels for the purpose of cost reduction and power saving. Multi-panel MIMO is expected to become promising for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems. This article gives an overview of multi-panel MIMO systems, including downlink, uplink, and non-coherent transmissions, and discuss research challenges and future directions of multi-panel MIMO. We also propose new multi-panel codebook design and corresponding CSI feedback design for 5G systems as well as non-coherent MIMO transmission.",

      "abstract": "Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles) are expected to be an important component of 5G/ beyond 5G (B5G) cellular architectures that can potentially facilitate wireless broadcast or point-to-multipoint transmissions. The distinct features of various drones such as the maximum operational altitude, communication, coverage, computation, and endurance impel the use of a multi-tier architecture for future dronecell networks. In this context, this article focuses on investigating the feasibility of multi-tier drone network architecture over traditional single-tier drone networks and identifying the scenarios in which drone networks can potentially complement the traditional RF-based terrestrial networks. We first identify the challenges associated with multi-tier drone networks as well as drone-assisted cellular networks. We then review the existing state-of-the-art innovations in drone networks and drone-assisted cellular networks. We then investigate the performance of a multi-tier drone network in terms of spectral efficiency of downlink transmission while illustrating the optimal intensity and altitude of drones in different tiers numerically. Our results demonstrate the specific network load conditions (i.e., ratio of user intensity and base station intensity) where deployment of drones can be beneficial (in terms of spectral efficiency of downlink transmission) for conventional terrestrial cellular networks.",

      "abstract": "The expected growth in mobile video demand over broadband cellular networks is one of the key factors driving the wireless industry to develop the fifth generation of network technology. This scenario is fueling the need for group-oriented services (i.e., multicast and broadcast) in order to efficiently manage the radio resources, and consequently grant different groups of users simultaneous access to the same multimedia content with differentiated quality of service. The evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service (eMBMS), standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project, is one of the technologies likely to be extended to 5G systems with the aim of addressing point-to-multipoint services. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are also being considered as a driver to increase the efficient use of the spectrum in multi-user environments with asymmetric data delivery. The present article proposes the joint use of subgrouping multicast techniques and NOMA in an eMBMS-like scenario. Performance is evaluated in envisaged 5G environments, where different quality video services are delivered to a group of users interested in the same contents.",

Previous works mainly focus on how to use UAVs to assist WSNs in sensing and data collection jobs, or target localization with a single data source in surveillance systems, while the potential of multi-UAV sensor networks has not been fully explored. To this end, we propose a new cooperative network platform and system architecture of multi-UAV surveillance. First we propose the design concepts of a multi- UAV cooperative resource scheduling and task assignment scheme based on the animal colony perception method. Second, we provide the moving small target recognition technique and localization and tracking model using the fusion of multiple data sources. In addition, this article discusses the establishment of suitable algorithms based on machine learning due to the complexity of the monitoring area. Finally, experiments of recognition and tracking of multiple moving targets are addressed, which are monitored by multi- UAV and sensors.",

      "abstract": "The efficient integration of optical switching in data center networks is being studied as a means to cope with surging traffic demands. Optically switched, flatter network architectures more efficiently handle the east-west traffic profiles of modern data centers. Limitations in the port count and reconfiguration speed of optical switches require novel network designs offering network scalability and dynamicity. Interaction of the optically switched data plane with a software-defined control and orchestration framework, meeting current common practices in data centers, necessitates the design of custom network control algorithms and software modules as well as the integration of novel functionalities. The approach of the European project NEPHELE is presented, offering an endto- end solution that addresses the optical data plane, the control plane, and its interaction with the application layer.",

      "abstract": "The 3GPP is in the process of developing the next generation radio access technology, named New Radio (NR), which will be proposed as a candidate technology for IMT-2020. This article outlines the wide bandwidth operation of NR, among other new features being considered, based on the up-to-date discussions and decisions made in 3GPP standardization meetings. The much wider channel bandwidth of NR, compared to LTE, enables more efficient use of resources than the existing carrier aggregation framework with lower control overhead. The support of multiple sub-carrier spacing options allows NR to operate in a wide range of carrier frequency from sub-6 GHz band to mmWave band with appropriate handling of multi-path delay spread and phase noise depending on the carrier frequency. In addition, the introduction of the new bandwidth part concept allows flexible and dynamic configuration of UE's operating bandwidth, which will make NR an energy-efficient solution despite the support of wide bandwidth. Other NR wideband operation related issues, such as the support of UEs with limited RF capability and frequency domain resource indexing, are also explained in this article.",

      "abstract": "With the popularization of wearable devices, designing a network architecture that can meet the latency requirements of different wearable devices and can also efficiently utilize network communication, storage, and computation resources will be a challenging problem. In this article, we first propose a new 5G wearable network based on 5G ultra-dense cellular network and mobile edge computing, to meet the access and latency requirements of wearable devices. Then we use network slicing technology in the proposed 5G wearable network to enhance the network resource sharing and energy-efficient utilization. In addition, based on the service cognitive engine and network cognitive engine deployed in the network, we introduce data-driven network slicing management to adjust the network resources in accordance with the wearable service dynamics. Finally, some challenges and open issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The drive toward ubiquitous communications has long been encompassed by the concept of a connected or smart city. The idea that data transfer and real-time data analysis can enhance the quality of life for urban inhabitants is compelling, and one can easily envision the provision of exciting new services and applications that such an information- driven city could provide. The challenge in achieving a truly smart city stems largely from communications technologies -- fixed line, wireless, backhaul, and fronthaul -- and how these are combined to provide fast, reliable, and secure communications coverage. Here, we report on the key observations from the Connected OFCity Challenge competition, held at OFC 2017, which addressed the fixed and wireless access network requirements for smart cities. It is shown that from a technological perspective, future optical networks will be capable of securely supporting extremely low-latency and high-bandwidth applications. However, as shown by using Networked Music Performance as a particularly challenging example application, how readily this is achieved will depend on the interplay between wired and wireless access services.",

      "abstract": "5G New Radio (NR) access technology is envisioned to operate in sub-1 GHz to 100 GHz spectrum and support diverse use cases, including Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and Multimedia-Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN). NR is currently being standardized in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In order to address diverse scenarios and deployments, a scalable CP-OFDM waveform has been approved in 3GPP as part of NR physical layer design for both uplink and downlink transmissions. The waveform is scalable in the sense that the sub-carrier spacing of OFDM can be chosen according to 15 \u00d7 2<sup>n</sup> kHz, where n is an integer and 15 kHz is the subcarrier spacing used in Long Term Evolution (LTE). The choice of integer-valued parameter n depends on various factors, including type of deployments, service requirements, hardware impairments, mobility, performance and implementation complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive discussion of the factors involved in the design of NR OFDM numerology to support eMBB, IoT, and MBSFN.",

      "abstract": "Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future Fifth Generation (5G) networks to facilitate the cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure in a way that each logical network (i.e. network slice) can be customized and dimensioned to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g. mobile broadband, smart city, connected car, public safety, fixed wireless access) and users (e.g. general public, enterprise customers, virtual operators, content providers). The practical realization of such capability still raises numerous technical challenges, both in the Core and RAN parts of the 5G system. Through a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the realization of RAN slicing has on the different layers of the radio interface protocol architecture, this article proposes a framework for the support and specification of RAN slices based on the definition of a set of configuration descriptors that characterize the features, policies and resources to be put in place across the radio protocol layers of a next-generation RAN node.",

      "abstract": "With the exponential growth of content in recent years, users are primarily interested in obtaining particular content and are not concerned with the host housing the content. By treating content as a first class citizen, information- centric networks (ICN) seek to transform the Internet from a host-to-host communication model to a content-centric model. A key component of ICN is to cache content at storage-enabled routers. By caching content at in-network routers, network performance can be improved by delivering content from routers closer to the user and not from the origin servers (content custodians). In this article, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art cache management and routing policies in ICN. We present a small comparison study of some state-of-the-art algorithms on a real Internet topology to help the reader appreciate how the different strategies compare against one another. Our simulation results demonstrate that it is hard to pick a winner among existing policies. We conclude the article with a discussion of open research questions.",

      "abstract": "The emergent paradigm of edge computing advocates that computational and storage resources can be extended to the edge of the network so that the impact of data transmission latency over the Internet can be effectively reduced for time-constrained Internet of Things applications. With the widespread deployment of edge computing devices, the energy demand of these devices has increased and started to become a noticeable issue for the suitable development of urban systems. In this article, we propose a unified energy management framework for enabling a sustainable edge computing paradigm with distributed renewable energy resources. This framework supports cooperation between the energy supply system and the edge computing system so that renewable energy can be fully utilized while offering improved quality of service for time-constrained IoT applications. A prototype system is also implemented by using microgrid (solar-wind hybrid energy system) and edge computing devices together. The experiment results demonstrate that renewable energy is fully capable of supporting the reliable running of edge computing devices in the prototype system during most (94.8 percent) of the experimental period when our proposed framework was employed.",

However, a key challenge is the high power consumption imposed by its numerous RF chains, which may be mitigated by opting for low-resolution ADCs, while tolerating a moderate performance loss. In this article, we discuss several important issues based on the most recent research on mmWave massive MIMO systems relying on low-resolution ADCs. We discuss the key transceiver design challenges, including channel estimation, signal detector, channel information feedback and transmit precoding. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-ADC architecture as an alternative technique of improving overall system performance. Finally, the associated challenges and potential implementations of the practical 5G mmWave massive MIMO system with ADC quantizers are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Recently, SDN has emerged as a promising technology to cost-effectively provide the scale and flexibility necessary for IoT services. In this article, we consider the wireless SDN for IoT, referred to as SDN-IoT, which is anticipated to smartly route traffic and use underutilized network resources to deliver IoT data to the cloud/ Internet. However, the rapid increase of IoT devices and the subsequent massive surge of the IoT data traffic are expected to place a huge strain on the SDN-IoT. In this article, we focus on this issue and point out the importance of assigning suitable channels to each SDN-IoT switch to avoid potential network congestion. In particular, we consider how to exploit POC assignment in the SDN-IoT. However, our investigation reveals that the conventional fixed POC assignment algorithms are not viable for the highly dynamic large-scale SDN-IoT. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel deep-learning-based intelligent POC assignment for the wireless SDN-IoT where the IoT data traffic dynamically changes. In particular, we envision two deep-learning-based strategies to predict the future IoT traffic load and to adaptively assign POCs according to predicted traffic load, respectively. Computer-based simulation results demonstrate that with the envisioned deep learning methods carried out at the SDN-IoT controller, our proposal achieves high accuracy of traffic load prediction and quick convergence of the channel assignment process. Additionally, in contrast with the conventional POC assignment algorithms, our proposal significantly improves the network performance.",

      "abstract": "TCP BBR is a new TCP variant developed at Google, which, as of this year, is fully deployed in Google's internal WANs and used by services such as Google.com and YouTube. In contrast to other commonly used TCP variants, TCP BBR is not loss-based but model-based: It builds a model of the network path between communicating nodes in terms of bottleneck bandwidth and minimum round-trip delay and tries to operate at the point where all available bandwidth is used and the round-trip delay is at a minimum. Although TCP BBR has indeed resulted in lower latency and more efficient usage of bandwidth in fixed networks, its performance over cellular networks is less clear. This article studies TCP BBR in live mobile networks and through emulations, and compares its performance with TCP NewReno and TCP CUBIC, two of the most commonly used TCP variants. The results from these studies suggest that in most cases TCP BBR outperforms both TCP NewReno and TCP CUBIC. However, under precise network conditions, competing TCP BBR flows do not share the available bandwidth in a fair way, something that shows up, for example, when shorter TCP BBR flows struggle to get their fair share from longer ones.",

      "abstract": "The capability of in-situ antenna measurement and diagnostics using a compact low-cost unmanned aerial system is presented. An onboard power sensor collects amplitude-only measurements, which are processed by means of an iterative phase retrieval technique. This technique allows recovering an equivalent currents distribution, which characterizes the antenna under test (AUT). These currents can be used for antenna diagnostics as well as to evaluate the field radiated by the AUT. In the field of mobile networks, the proposed system is of interest for rapid assessment of the antenna's operational conditions, providing radioelectric coverage within the mobile network cells and allowing the evaluation of antenna failures, such as incorrect tilt or beamforming/ feeding network malfunction. A proof of concept of the system is conducted for testing a commercial base transceiver station antenna under normal and malfunctioning operation conditions, discussing the extension of the system to allow measurements at millimeter-wave frequency bands.",

      "abstract": "The paradigm of previous 4G cellular technology has led to an increase in requirements for high data rate demands of mobile users in 5G. In order to meet this demand, constant densification of communication networks was required. Ultra Dense Networks (UDNs) have been proposed as a promising 5G technology to fulfill these requirements by the efficient and dynamic distribution of the radio resources. However, for implementation of UDN, mobile operators have to face many challenges such as severe interference resulting in a limited capacity due to the dense deployment of small cells, site location and acquisition for the deployment of base stations, backhauling issues, energy consumption, etc. In this article, in order to alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel idea of Ultra Dense Cloud-Drone Network (UDCDN) architecture. This scheme is featured with \"on-demand\" quality and substantial flexibility in terms of deployment. This anchors the challenges of traditional UDN settings and offers numerous benefits. Through simulation results of cell coverage, we verify the genuineness of implementing the proposed scheme and offer a new paradigm shift for UDN.",

      "abstract": "This article concentrates on the multicast service in massive MIMO systems, and develops a hierarchical security model-based opportunistic NOMA scheme for 3D massive MIMO channel. In the considered scenario, the base station communicates with different security level users, where eavesdroppers are randomly deployed. Different security level users are classified into NOMA users and non-NOMA users, where NOMA users employ successive interference cancellation to cancel the low security multicast interference and separate their own data streams. The proposed scheme employs multicast beamforming in the multicast group, and applies null-space-based interference cancellation to eliminate the signal leakage generated by other groups. Numerical results revealed that hierarchical security model-based opportunistic NOMA schemes can significantly improve the network throughput and secrecy capacity in typical massive MIMO scenarios.",

      "abstract": "With an exponential increase in smart device users, there is an increase in the bulk amount of data generation from various smart devices, which varies with respect to all the essential V's used to categorize it as big data. Generally, most service providers, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and so on, have deployed a large number of geographically distributed data centers to process this huge amount of data generated from various smart devices so that users can get quick response time. For this purpose, Hadoop, and SPARK are widely used by these service providers for processing large datasets. However, less emphasis has been given on the underlying infrastructure (the network through which data flows), which is one of the most important components for successful implementation of any designed solution in this environment. In the worst case, due to heavy network traffic with respect to data migrations across different data centers, the underlying network infrastructure may not be able to transfer data packets from source to destination, resulting in performance degradation. Focusing on all these issues, in this article, we propose a novel SDN-based big data management approach with respect to the optimized network resource consumption such as network bandwidth and data storage units. We analyze various components at both the data and control planes that can enhance the optimized big data analytics across multiple cloud data centers. For example, we analyze the performance of the proposed solution using Bloom-filter-based insertion and deletion of an element in the flow table maintained at the OpenFlow controller, which makes most of the decisions for network traffic classification using the rule-and-action-based mechanism. Using the proposed solution, developers can deploy and analyze real-time traffic behavior for the future big data applications in MCE.",

      "abstract": "Upcoming 5G mobile networks are addressing ambitious KPIs not just in terms of capacity and latency, but also in terms of network control and management. In this direction, network management schemes need to evolve to provide the required flexibility, and automated and integrated management of 5G networks. This also applies to the 5G-Crosshaul transport network, which provides an integrated fronthaul and backhaul. Software defined networking and NFV are seen as key enablers for that. This article validates the flexibility, scalability, and recovery capabilities of the 5G-Crosshaul architecture in a testbed distributed geographically. More specifically, the central component of the validation is the hierarchical 5G-XCI, conceived to handle multi-domain multi-technology transport network resources. Its performance is characterized through two experimental case studies. The first one illustrates the automated provisioning of all network resources required to deploy a complete LTE virtual mobile network featuring fronthaul and backhaul configurations. This takes 10.467 s on average for the network under test. The second one exploits the flexibility of the hierarchical XCI to apply local or centralized service recovery in the event of link failure depending on the desired path optimality vs. recovery time trade-off. On average, recovery takes 0.299 s and 6.652 s, respectively. Overall, the proposed solution contributes to attaining the target set for 5G networks of reducing service setup from hours to minutes.",

      "abstract": "The world of connected devices has led to the rise of the Internet of Things paradigm, where applications rely on multiple devices, gathering and sharing data across highly heterogeneous networks. The variety of possible mechanisms, protocols, and hardware has become a hindrance in the development of architectures capable of addressing the most common IoT use cases, while abstracting services from the underlying communication subsystem. Moreover, the world is moving toward new strict requirements in terms of timeliness and low latency in combination with ultra-high availability and reliability. Thus, future IoT architectures will also have to support the requirements of these cyber-physical applications. In this regard, edge computing has been presented as one of the most promising solutions, relying on the cooperation of nodes by moving services directly to end devices and caching information locally. Therefore, in this article, we propose a modular and scalable architecture based on lightweight virtualization. The provided modularity, combined with the orchestration supplied by Docker, simplifies management and enables distributed deployments, creating a highly dynamic system. Moreover, characteristics such as fault tolerance and system availability are achieved by distributing the application logic across different layers, where failures of devices and micro-services can be masked by this natively redundant architecture, with minimal impact on the overall system performance. Experimental results have validated the implementation of the proposed architecture for on-demand services deployment across different architecture layers.",

      "abstract": "The OOB radiation from large arrays with nonlinear hardware has a different radiation pattern than the beamformed in-band signal. This is the main difference between the OOB radiation from large arrays and from well-studied legacy systems. Beamforming might focus the OOB radiation in certain directions but also significantly reduce the total power that has to be transmitted. For cost and power-consumption reasons, large arrays might have to be built from low-complexity hardware without advanced precompensation for linearization, which increases the relative amount of OOB radiation. Given that large arrays will be used in future base stations, a correct understanding of the OOB radiation is crucial to specify appropriate linearity requirements for the hardware. We show that the OOB radiation from large arrays varies little between coherence times; it is isotropic in many cases; and when it is beamformed, it is directed toward the served user in a very narrow beam with an array gain equal to or less than that of the in-band signal. We draw the conclusion that, compared to legacy systems, less stringent linearity requirements can be used in many systems with large arrays by virtue of the lower transmit power needed",

      "abstract": "With the severe spectrum congestion of sub-6 GHz cellular systems, large-scale antenna systems in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands can potentially meet the high data rate envisioned for fifth generation communications. Performance evaluation of antenna systems is an essential step in the product design and development stage. However, conventional cable conducted test methods are not applicable for mmWave devices. There is a strong need for over-the-air (OTA) radiated methods, where mmWave device performance can be evaluated in a reliable, repeatable, and feasible way in laboratory conditions. In this article, radiated testing methods are reviewed, with a focus on their principle and applicability for beam steerable mmWave devices. To explore the spatial sparsity of mmWave channel profiles, a cost-effective simplified 3D sectored multi-probe anechoic chamber system with an OTA antenna selection scheme is proposed. This setup is suitable for evaluation of beam-steerable devices, including both base station and user equipment devices. The requirements for the test system design are analyzed, including the measurement range, number of OTA antennas, number of active OTA antennas, and amount of channel emulator resource. Finally, several metrics to validate system performance are described for evaluation of mmWave devices.",

In Release 14, LTE-M has been further enhanced by features in important areas. In this article these features are described and explained. The range of possible use cases that can be addressed by LTE-M devices is greatly improved through the introduction of data rate improvements for device Category M1 and the new device Category M2, which increases the maximum supported data rates, the support for location services with significantly improved accuracy, and support for multicast to enable, for example, simultaneous firmware downloads to a multitude of devices. Release 14 also improves the ability of LTE-M to support voice services by means of a set of specific optimizations. Furthermore, the higher bit rates are beneficial for the LTE-M fulfillment of 5G requirements.",

      "abstract": "As an alternative to complex cryptographic techniques, PLS is emerging as a promising paradigm to protect wireless communication systems from eavesdropping attacks by exploiting the physical characteristics of the wireless channels. Among various PLS approaches, the one based on cooperative communication is favorable and has received a lot of interest from the research community. Although PLS schemes with half-duplex relays have been extensively researched, the issue of PLS in cooperative systems with full-duplex (FD) relays is far from being comprehensively understood. In this article, we first present the state of the art on PLS approaches proposed for FD cooperative systems. We then provide a case study in which a source-based jamming scheme is proposed to enhance the secrecy performance of a cooperative system with an untrusted FD relay. Finally, we outline several interesting yet challenging future research problems in this topic.",

      "abstract": "3GPP has enhanced the point-to-multipoint (PTM) communication capabilities of 4G LTE in all releases since the adoption of eMBMS in Release-9. Recent enhancements cover not only television services, but also critical machine-type and vehicular communications, following the backward-compatibility design philosophy of LTE. This article discusses the opportunity in the design and standardization of 5G to break with the existing paradigm for PTM transmissions in 4G LTE, where broadcast PTM transmissions were initially conceived as an add-on and pre-positioned service. 5G brings the opportunity to incorporate PTM capabilities as built-in delivery features from the outset, integrating point-to-point and PTM modes under one common framework and enabling dynamic use of PTM to maximize network and spectrum efficiency. This approach will open the door to completely new levels of network management and delivery cost efficiency. The article also discusses the implications of PTM for network slicing to customize and optimize network resources on a common 5G infrastructure to accommodate different use cases and services taking into account user density.",

In parallel, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and networking have attracted increasing attention recently due to their high agility and numerous applications. In this article, we present a vision of UAV-supported UDNs. First, we present four representative scenarios to show the broad applications of UAV-supported UDNs in communications, caching, and energy transfer. Then we highlight the efficient power control in UAV-supported UDNs by discussing the main design considerations and methods in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance superiority of UAV-supported UDNs via case study simulations, compared to traditional fixed-infrastructure-based networks. In addition, we discuss the dominating technical challenges and open issues ahead.",

      "abstract": "This article investigates the prominent dilemma between capacity and reliability in heterogeneous ultra-dense distributed networks, and advocates a new measure of effective capacity to quantify the maximum sustainable data rate of a link while preserving the quality of service of the link in such networks. Recent breakthroughs are brought forth in developing the theory of the effective capacity in heterogeneous ultra-dense distributed networks. Potential applications of the effective capacity are demonstrated on the admission control, power control, and resource allocation of such networks, with substantial gains revealed over existing technologies. This new measure is of particular interest to ultra-dense deployment of the emerging 5G wireless networks in the unlicensed spectrum, leveraging the capacity gain brought by the use of the unlicensed band and the stringent reliability sustained by 5G in future heterogeneous network environments.",

      "abstract": "As multimedia services are gaining considerable popularity in the Internet of Things, providing QoE in smart mmIoT becomes a challenging issue. This article conceptualizes a new framework named SMP, to price the QoE rather than the binary data traffic in IoT multimedia services. By introducing PaaR in QoE-driven network scheduling in mmIoTs, a new dimension of price distortion is available in multimedia resource allocation, complementing traditional rate distortion and power distortion resource allocation approaches. This article also discusses open research challenges in SMP resource allocation, including the difficulty of numerical presentation of QoE, the unavailability of packet-level distortion information, and the non-concavity of the utility functions. A case study is presented to illustrate the PaaR potentials of improving QoE through the SMP framework in mmIoTs.",

However, LBS provides the functionality by extracting personal data from users, which may incur privacy leakage risk, such as intrusion, theft, and unauthorized sale of sensitive information. Hence, the mass market share of LBS depends on how well the privacy of citizens can be protected. In this article, we specifically study the privacy issues in LBSs. In detail, we start with classifying different types of LBSs and analyzing the privacy leakage presented in each type. After summarizing the state-of-the-art work on location privacy and query privacy, we propose a query content preservation approach with the aim of providing accurate LBS answer with zero server knowledge on query content. Finally, we present some open problems that may foster future research on LBS privacy preservation.",

      "abstract": "Intelligence is one of the most important aspects in the development of our future communities. Ranging from smart home to smart building to smart city, all these smart infrastructures must be supported by intelligent power supply. Smart grid is proposed to solve all challenges of future electricity supply. In smart grid, in order to realize optimal scheduling, an SM is installed at each home to collect the near-real-time electricity consumption data, which can be used by the utilities to offer better smart home services. However, the near-real-time data may disclose a user's private information. An adversary may track the application usage patterns by analyzing the user's electricity consumption profile. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation scheme. We divide users into different groups, and each group has a private blockchain to record its members' data. To preserve the inner privacy within a group, we use pseudonyms to hide users' identities, and each user may create multiple pseudonyms and associate his/ her data with different pseudonyms. In addition, the bloom filter is adopted for fast authentication. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet the security requirements and achieve better performance than other popular methods.",

      "abstract": "In IoT-based healthcare, medical devices are more vulnerable to numerous security threats and attacks than other network devices. Current solutions are able to provide protection to patients' data during data transmission to some extent, but cannot prevent some sophisticated threats and attacks such as collusion attacks and data leakage. In this article, we first investigate the challenges with privacy protected data collection. Then we propose a practical framework called PrivacyProtector, patient privacy protected data collection, with the objective of preventing these types of attacks. PrivacyProtector includes the ideas of secret sharing and share repairing (in case of data loss or compromise) for patients' data privacy. Since it is the first time, we apply the Slepian- Wolf-coding-based secret sharing (SW-SSS) in PrivacyProtector. In the framework, we use a distributed database consisting of multiple cloud servers, which ensures that the privacy of patients' personal data can remain protected as long as one of the servers remains uncompromised. We also present a patient access control scheme in which multiple cloud servers collaborate in shared construction to offer patients' data to healthcare providers without revealing the content of the data. The privacy performance analysis has shown that the PrivacyProtector framework is secure and privacy-protected against various attacks.",

For realization of efficient wireless communication networks in the THz band, it is imperative to develop channel models that can accurately and efficiently characterize the THz spectrum peculiarities. This article provides an in-depth view of channel modeling in the THz band, based on the deterministic, statistical, and hybrid methods. The state-of-the-art THz channel models in single-antenna and ultra-massive MIMO systems are extensively reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, the open challenges and potential research directions are highlighted regarding THz propagation modeling. Associated with the channel models, key physical parameters of the THz channel and their implications for wireless communication design are analyzed. The provided analysis lays the foundation for reliable and efficient ultra-broadband wireless communications in the THz band.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in semiconductor device technologies and the ever growing worldwide traffic explosion have focused great attention on THz frequencies, which had long been considered a forbidden region in the electromagnetic spectrum. The huge bandwidth, perhaps much larger than the total bandwidth used on Earth for all wireless systems, is now believed to be the only way to handle incredibly large amounts of data instantaneously by wireless means. In this article, we describe the development of a KIOSK data downloading system prototype designed for \"touch-and-go\" use. Implementation of the 300 GHz THz front-end components and the performance are briefly summarized. A preliminary investigation of the LoS channel responses and a simple comparison of the forward error correction algorithms in the given THz channel are presented as well. Finally, an experimental demonstration of instant data transfer with the prototype is described to confirm the feasibility of using the THz wave band for future wireless applications.",

      "abstract": "In the era of big data, the applications/services of the smart city are expected to offer end users better QoE than in a conventional smart city. Nevertheless, various types of sensors will produce an increasing volume of big data along with the implementation of a smart city, where we face redundant and diverse data. Therefore, providing satisfactory QoE will become the major challenge in the big-data-based smart city. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a novel big data architecture consisting of three planes: the data storage plane, the data processing plane, and the data application plane. The data storage plane stores a wide variety of data collected by sensors and originating from different data sources. Then the data processing plane filters, analyzes, and processes the ocean of data to make decisions autonomously for extracting high-quality information. Finally, the application plane initiates the execution of the events corresponding to the decisions delivered from the data processing plane. Under this architecture, we particularly use machine learning techniques, trying to acquire accurate data and deliver precise information to end users. Simulation results indicate that our proposals could achieve high QoE performance for the smart city.",

      "abstract": "Customer experience is becoming of utmost importance for operators in home network management. Hence, a notion of the customers' QoE is vital, but has mostly been neglected in favor of QoS. In this article, we aim to close a significant gap between QoS and QoE in home networks by proposing a framework for inferring QoE from remotely collected network QoS metrics. We focus on video services (e.g., YouTube application) as the main contributor and generator of indoor network traffic. A case study is performed where an experimentally obtained dataset comprising network and application QoS parameters is obtained under varying conditions (i.e., poor coverage, network overload, contention, and interference). Predictive modeling is then used to build a predictor for multiple QoE classes given the network QoS metrics remotely accessible from access points based on industry adopted standards (i.e., TR-181). This enables operators to infer specific QoE metrics using remotely collected passive network measurement with no knowledge of application-specific parameters. We show that the proposed framework achieves accuracy in the range of 85 to 95 percent depending on the QoE class, hence demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of our approach.",

On the other hand, it also consumes extra energy for spectrum sensing and switching. This is a double-edged sword posing a dilemma between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Recent advances in RF energy harvesting and transfer promote RF-powered CRSN in providing a promising way to address this challenge. In RF-powered CRSNs, sensor nodes can dynamically access the vacant licensed channels for interference-free data transmission and can also utilize the strong signals over the occupied licensed channels for energy harvesting. In this article, we investigate RF energy harvesting and transfer in CRSNs. We first introduce the architecture and advantages of RF-powered CRSN, typical applications, as well as the key challenges arising from applying RF energy harvesting and transfer into CRSN. We then propose a resource allocation framework to demonstrate how to jointly control the dynamic channel access and energy management to optimize network utility while guaranteeing network stability and sustainability. Some future directions are finally envisioned for further research.",

      "abstract": "The requirement of high data rate in 5G calls for utilization of the mmWave frequency band. Researchers seeking to compensate for mmWave's high path loss have proposed that mmWave MIMO systems make use of beamforming. Hybrid beamforming systems demonstrate promising performance in achieving high gain and directivity by using phase shifters. The actual implementation, however, is costly and complex. To reduce such cost and complexity, this article presents actual prototypes of the lens antenna to be used in 5G mmWave beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase shifter enables beamforming without the heavy network of phase shifters, while gain and directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens. Proposed in this article are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the other for mobile usage. The lens antennas' sizes are varied to also discuss the lens design. Their performance is evaluated using measurements and simulation data along with link- and system-level analysis. Results show the lens antenna yields high gain, directivity, and improved beam-switching feasibility compared to when a lens is not used.",

      "abstract": "Density information plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems for not only traffic control but also information sharing. Existing products have been able to provide coarsegrained density services. For example, Google Maps can illustrate the traffic conditions by different colors via Internet connection. Vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communications can locally acquire the density by information exchange and neighbor counting. However, either the Internet access or one-by-one counting leads to a sub-second-level delay, which cannot satisfy real-time vehicular applications such as autonomous navigation and data dissemination. To speed up density acquisition, we propose an RDD system. Leveraging the frequency resource, RDD divides the wireless channel into fine-grained subchannels and detects the neighbors in a parallel manner. We establish a testbed using software defined radios and experimentally validate RDD. Moreover, to evaluate RDD in high-density scenarios, extensive simulations are conducted based on real collected data. Both the experiment and simulation results demonstrate that RDD achieves 100 ms level density detection, while the state-of-the-art time-domain acceleration method is at the 10 ms level.",

      "abstract": "Connected car technology (also referred to as VANET) has gradually paved its way to legislation in several countries and soon will be followed by mass-scale deployment. However, the race between the advancements in technologies and utilization of the available resources have left a question mark on the future of pure VANET. Therefore, the research community together with academia and industry have foreseen the evolution of VANET into VANET-based clouds. The data- or content-centric communication paradigm is the point of convergence in these technologies because the content is shared among different nodes in different forms such as infotainment or safety. However, the current IP-based networking is not an ideal choice for content-centric applications because of its larger overhead for establishing, maintaining, and securing the path, addressing complexity, non-scalability for content, routing and mobility management overhead, and so on. Therefore, the limitations and shortcomings of current IP-based networking and the need for efficient content delivery advocate for a paradigm shift. To this end, a new content-centric networking paradigm, namely NDN, has been employed to address the aforementioned issues related to content-centric networking while using IP-based networking. In this article, we foresee the integration of VANET-based clouds with NDN called NDN-VC for reliable, efficient, robust, and safe intelligent transportation systems. We particularly aim at the architecture and concise naming mechanism for NDN-VC. Furthermore, we also outline the unique future challenges faced by the NDN-VC.",

      "abstract": "The unabated flurry of research activities dedicated to gaining business insights from a flood of data generated by heterogeneous mobile sources, such as the Internet of Vehicles, sensors, and smartphones, has instigated a new research domain called MBD. At the core of this mobile environment, scalability, cost effectiveness, reliability, analytics, and security are important concerns. Coping with these issues in handling MBD requires understanding the challenges associated with it. Mobile computing and big data have been widely studied separately; however, very few studies have explored the convergence of these two domains. In this article, we critically review recent research efforts directed at MBD. We also classify the MBD by devising a thematic taxonomy that is based on source, analytics, applications, characteristics, security, and data type. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities offered by MBD in terms of analytics. Some potential uses of MBD in healthcare, telecommunication, digital advertising, and transportation are also presented. Several open research challenges are discussed as future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The emerging 5G technology will support high data rates with low latency and high levels of reliability. To satisfy these requirements, mobile operators have deployed enhancements to LTE networks in a move toward the development of future 5G networks. One of these enhancements is the LTE-broadcasting service. Another enhancement is the employment of network functions virtualization, which will provide elasticity of resources, scalability, and flexibility. In a virtualized LTE-broadcasting network, the main components of the LTE-broadcasting service will be implemented as VNFs. This article introduces a scheme to determine the number of redundant VNF components necessary to satisfy the reliability requirements of broadcasting services in 5G networks. A series-parallel redundant model determines the optimum number of virtual components instantiated to achieve a required service reliability level. The model is compared to a parallel-series one and shown to achieve greater effectiveness, achieving five nines reliability and promoting low end-to-end delay.",

      "abstract": "Future route guidance application will make use of wireless traffic information exchange between vehicles and infrastructure roadside units (RSUs) to form a ubiquitous connected network known as the Internet of (connected) Vehicles (IoV). Current standards, such as Wireless Access for Vehicular Environment and ETSI Intelligent Transport Systems, for vehicular networking recommend elliptic-curve-based security algorithms to reliably share traffic information and provide defense against network attacks. However, data integrity attacks cannot be detected by the security algorithms proposed in the standards and can degrade the accuracy of an IoV route guidance application. RSUs have limited transmission range and rely on traffic information reported by vehicles within their range to estimate traffic density data in their vicinity. Malicious vehicles can transmit wrong traffic information, resulting in non-optimal route decisions. We propose a reputation algorithm known as RepGuide that enables reliable route guidance using IoV. RepGuide finds outliers in the traffic density information and identifies them as suspicious data. The algorithm then verifies the suspicious traffic information by multihop communication exchange with vehicles outside the transmission range of the RSU. Any suspicious data that cannot be verified is not used for finding optimal routes. Our performance evaluation results show that RepGuide reduces the travel time by 18 percent for an IoV route guidance application.",

Running the Extendable Mobile Ad Hoc Network Emulator (EMANE) framework, we show how to reproduce measured characteristics, namely throughput and round-trip time, of real tactical radios using wideband or narrowband TDMA-based waveforms. Additionally, a solution to simulate rate adaptation is proposed. An introduction to EMANE and the EMANE radio model plugins is also provided.",

In the content sharing context, the social attributes of mobile users have special concerns to generate effective D2MD groups and D2MD links, and due to reuse of licensed cellular spectrum, the interference between D2MD groups and cellular users should be carefully mitigated. This article presents a D2MD scheme for content sharing in cellular networks by taking into account social and physical attributes in D2MD cluster formation, and jointly optimizing power and channel allocation among D2MD clusters. Simulation results validate the significant throughput gain for D2MD-based content sharing in 5G cellular networks.",

      "abstract": "Optical network security is attracting increasing research attention, as loss of confidentiality of data transferred through an optical network could impact a huge number of users and services. Data encryption is an effective way to enhance optical network security. In particular, QKD is being investigated as a secure mechanism to provide keys for data encryption at the endpoints of an optical network. In a QKD-enabled optical network, apart from TDChs, two additional channels, called QSChs and PIChs, are required to support secure key synchronization. How to allocate network resources to QSChs, PIChs, and TDChs is emerging as a novel problem for the design of a security-guaranteed optical network. This article addresses the resource allocation problem in optical networks secured by QKD. We first discuss a possible architecture for a QKD-enabled optical network, where an SDN controller is in charge of allocating the three types of channels (TDCh, QSCh, and PICh) over different wavelengths exploiting WDM. To save wavelength resources, we propose to adopt OTDM to allocate multiple QSChs and PIChs over the same wavelength. An RWTA algorithm is designed to allocate wavelength and time slot resources for the three types of channels. Different security levels are included in the RWTA algorithm by considering different key updating periods (i.e., the period after which the secure key between two endpoints has to be updated). Illustrative simulation results show the effects of different security-level configuration schemes on resource allocation.",

      "abstract": "The steadfast emergence of AVs promises many advantages, including an enhanced driving and transportation experience for humans, and increased automation of the production and distribution cycles for businesses. Meanwhile, route planning tools have evolved greatly over recent years and have grown popular across the different sectors. Despite this evolution, we argue in this work that current route planning approaches are not readily applicable to AVs and their emerging requirements. A smooth and safe introduction of AVs into the road networks is therefore challenging, especially as the road is shared with vehicles at different levels of autonomy. In light of this, we review the enabling technologies for more capable route planning techniques and describe the inevitable elements and considerations for routing AVs in a mixed-traffic environment.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, mini-drones, officially called unmanned aerial vehicles, are widely used in many military and civilian fields. Compared to traditional ad hoc networks, the mobile ad hoc networks established by UAVs are more efficient in completing complex tasks in harsh environments. However, due to the unique characteristics of UAVs (e.g., high mobility and sparse deployment), existing protocols or algorithms cannot be directly used for UAVs. In this article, we focus on the routes designed for UAVs, and aim to present a somewhat complete survey of the routing protocols. Moreover, the performance of existing routing protocols is compared in detail, which naturally leads to a great number of open research problems that are outlined afterward.",

      "abstract": "Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) provide an effective solution to accommodate the explosively growing data traffic of multimedia services and real-time applications. However, the densification of large numbers of static small cells faces many fundamental challenges, including deployment cost, energy consumption and control, and so on. This motivates us to develop software-defined space-air-ground integrated moving cells (SAGECELL), a programmable, scalable, and flexible framework to integrate space, air, and ground resources for matching dynamic traffic demands with network capacity supplies. First, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art literature. Then the conceptual architecture of SAGECELL is elaborated in detail, and the technological benefits are emphasized. Next, we present four typical application cases of SAGECELL. A case study is conducted based on real-world road topology to validate the efficiency and flexibility of SAGECELL. Finally, we identify future research directions and challenges, and conclude this article.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous growth, heterogeneity, and ever increasing demand of services, load balancing of cloud servers is an emerging challenge to meet highly demanding requirements (e.g., data rates, latency, quality of service) of 5G network applications. Although various load balancing techniques have been proposed, some of these techniques either require installation of dedicated additional load balancers for each service, or manual reconfiguration of the device to handle new services is desired. These techniques are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical. Moreover, most of the existing load balancing schemes do not consider service types. This article presents an SDN-based load balancing (SBLB) service for cloud servers to maximize resource utilization and minimize response time of users. The constituents of the proposed scheme are an application module that runs on top of an SDN controller and server pools that connect to the controller through OpenFlow switches. The application module consists of a service classification module, a dynamic load balancing module, and a monitoring module. The controller handles all messages, manages host pools, and maintains the load of host in real time. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed scheme. Through experimental results, SBLB demonstrates significant decrease in average response time and reply time.",

To this end, the emerging software defined networking (SDN) paradigm has the potential to enable the redesign and successful deployment of these systems. In this article, we propose a set of novel architecture designs for SDN-enabled mobile ad hoc networks in the tactical field. We discuss in detail the challenges raised by the ad hoc and coalition network environment, and we present specific solutions to address them. The proposed approaches build on evidence from experimental evaluation of such architectures and leverage recent theoretical results from SDN deployments in large backbone networks.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles allow rapidly deploying a multihop communication backbone in challenging environments with applications in public safety, search and rescue missions, crowd surveillance, and disaster area monitoring. Due to environmental obstructions in the above scenarios or intentional jamming, the communication links between peer unmanned aerial vehicless are susceptible to outages. This necessitates resiliency measures to be closely integrated into the network design. To address the needs of efficient and robust end-to-end data relaying, we propose an aerial network management protocol built on top of an SDN architecture. Unique to our design, each unmanned aerial vehicle becomes an SDN switch that performs under directives sent by a centralized controller. Using a novel 3D spatial coverage-related metric, the controller calculates diverse multiple paths among unmanned aerial vehicles so that isolated and localized failures do not interrupt the overall network performance. The controller issues directives to the unmanned aerial vehicle switches through flow entries in Openflow v1.5 protocol for immediate and effective switching to the best available path. Results reveal that the proposed multi-path routing algorithm reduces the average end-to-end outage rate by 18 percent while increasing the average endto- end delay by 12 percent when compared to the traditional multi-path routing algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The development of the wireless Internet environment enables smart devices to be interconnected in various environments to provide convenient services to users. Specifically, in connected vehicle and smart home, the infotainment system and home electronics are connected to the Internet to individually provide services to users. The connected vehicle uses the display panel to show users music, video, navigation, and so on desired, or to develop a service that reduces the burden of driving and allows other activities by autonomous vehicles. However, these services are designed and developed independently on the platform and are not suitable for the concept of residential space of the future society. In this article, we propose a smart life platform by combining the concepts of connected vehicle and smart home into one platform. It also provides the SLP-MCAF to provide secure services within the platform. The SLP-MCAF strongly reinforces the authentication of objects and introduces clusters to improve availability so that services are not separated from the automobile or home, and services are continuous. Through simulation, we demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed platform.",

Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and avoid users' unhealthy behaviors. Existing health monitoring approaches still face many challenges of limited intelligence due to insufficient healthcare data. Therefore, this article proposes a smart personal health advisor (SPHA) for comprehensive and intelligent health monitoring and guidance. The SPHA monitors both physiological and psychological states of the user. The SPHAScore model is proposed to evaluate the overall health status of the user. Finally, a testbed for verification of feasibility and applicability of the proposed system was developed. The experimental and simulation results have shown that the proposed approach is efficient for proper user state monitoring.",

While enjoying the comfort and convenience brought by IoT, we also have to face tremendous energy consumption and carbon emissions that even cause climate deterioration. Extended from cloud computing, edge/fog computing and caching provide new thoughts on processing big data generated from distributed IoT devices. With the purpose of helping deal with the data explosion problem by edge caching, in this article we apply in-memory storage and processing to reduce energy consumption. We design two kinds of TTL in four cache replacement policies to cache data at the edge. We carry out a simulation experiment in a three-tier heterogeneous network structure using the RWP model and test the performance of in-memory caching and the traditional method. The analysis results manifest that our in-memory method is able to obtain better energy efficiency in edge caching, and has stable and low backhaul rate.",

      "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of Internet-enabled devices, there is an exponential increase in the information sharing among different geographically located smart devices. These smart devices may be heterogeneous in nature and may use different communication protocols for information sharing among themselves. Moreover, the data shared may also change with respect to various Vs (volume, velocity, variety, and value) to categorize it as big data. However, as these devices communicate with each other using an open channel, the Internet, there is a higher chance of information leakage during communication. Most of the existing solutions reported in the literature ignore these facts. Keeping focus on these points, in this article, we propose secure storage, verification, and auditing (SecSVA) of big data in cloud environment. SecSVA includes the following modules: an attribute-based secure data deduplication framework for data storage on the cloud, Kerberos-based identity verification and authentication, and Merkle hash-tree-based trusted third-party auditing on cloud. From the analysis, it is clear that SecSVA can provide secure third party auditing with integrity preservation across multiple domains in the cloud environment.",

      "abstract": "Drone swarming involves multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are able to manoeuver autonomously, providing a vast range of surveillance applications such as traffic evaluations, driver monitoring, disaster management, temporary network support, and pedestrian tracking. All these applications are an integral part of urban surveillance. In other words, cooperation between multiple drones can facilitate urban surveillance while being able to provide high-quality 3D visualization of the surroundings. This 3D representation is driven by the initiation of accurate and non-overlapping waypoints. Such efficient localization depends on the type of context and its security validation by the receiving entities. For example, a highly burdened context with negligible security is of limited use. This article presents a novel solution that is capable of securing the context information for sharing 3D waypoints between UAVs. The proposed approach achieves optimal localization through hierarchical context- aware aspect-oriented Petri nets while being powered by a novel drone context-exchange protocol for security validations.",

      "abstract": "Modern fog network architectures, empowered by IoT applications and 5G communications technologies, are characterized by the presence of a huge number of mobile nodes, which undergo frequent handovers, introducing a significant load on the involved network entities. Considering the distributed and flat nature of these architectures, DMM can be the only viable option for efficiently managing handovers in these scenarios. The existing DMM solutions are capable of providing smooth handovers, but lack robustness from the security point of view. Indeed, DMM depends on external mechanisms for handover security and uses a centralized device, which has obvious security and performance implications in flat architectures where hierarchical dependencies can introduce problems. We propose a new DMM schema based on the blockchain, capable of resolving hierarchical security issues without affecting the network layout, and also satisfying fully distributed security requirements with less consumption of energy.",

      "abstract": "Fog computing is a recent research trend to bring cloud computing services to network edges. EDCs are deployed to decrease the latency and network congestion by processing data streams and user requests in near real time. EDC deployment is distributed in nature and positioned between cloud data centers and data sources. Load balancing is the process of redistributing the work load among EDCs to improve both resource utilization and job response time. Load balancing also avoids a situation where some EDCs are heavily loaded while others are in idle state or doing little data processing. In such scenarios, load balancing between the EDCs plays a vital role for user response and real-time event detection. As the EDCs are deployed in an unattended environment, secure authentication of EDCs is an important issue to address before performing load balancing. This article proposes a novel load balancing technique to authenticate the EDCs and find less loaded EDCs for task allocation. The proposed load balancing technique is more efficient than other existing approaches in finding less loaded EDCs for task allocation. The proposed approach not only improves efficiency of load balancing; it also strengthens the security by authenticating the destination EDCs.",

Especially when the transmitted or stored data contains sensitive personal information, long-term protection over periods of ten or more years may be required, which can only be achieved with post-quantum cryptography. This article first gives a brief overview of post-quantum public-key cryptosystems based on hard mathematical problems related to hash functions, error-correcting codes, multivariate quadratic systems, and lattices. Then the suitability of lattice-based cryptosystems for resource-constrained devices is discussed and efficient implementations for 8 and 32-bit microcontrollers are outlined.",

      "abstract": "As one of the promising information-centric networking (ICN) architectures, NDN has attracted tremendous research attention and effort in the past decade. In particular, security and privacy remain significant concerns and challenges due to the fact that most of the traditional cryptographic primitives are no longer suitable for NDN architecture. For example, the traditional cryptographic primitives aim to secure point-to-point communications, always requiring explicit descriptions of to where or whom the data packets are intended, while network addressing or locating in NDN becomes implicit. To deal with such issues, the recently developed cryptographic primitives such as ABE have been applied to NDN. Also, to efficiently solve the trust-roots problem and seamlessly deploy cryptographic infrastructures, the concept of SDN has been introduced to NDN as well. This tutorial is devoted to exploring the interesting integration between NDN, ABE, and SDN.",

Finally, we present our understanding of counterattacks from both the application and theoretical aspects. We hope this article will shed light on the research field for interested readers.",

      "abstract": "While applications of the heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) proliferate, their performance requirements in terms of latency and jitter become more stringent and difficult to be met by the traditional cloud computing paradigm. As a result, a new paradigm called multi-access edge computing has emerged in recent years. It complements the centralized cloud platform by providing additional resources at the edge of radio access networks, and provides better support of IoT applications. One of the challenges of supporting IoT applications in mobile edge computing (MEC) is security. In this article, we will scrutinize the security issues of two IoT applications that can exploit the benefits of MEC. The first one is an environment perception system based on an industrial IoT network. The second one, which is gaining momentum fast, is mobile IoT based on a network of unmanned aerial vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation self-organizing networks (NG-SONs) are the key that will lead to the full automation of the network management in the forthcoming generations of cellular communications. New challenges, like the deployment of novel wireless services or the aim of operators to provide end-to-end monitoring and optimization, make it necessary to develop an innovative scheme for network management. Within SON, self-healing (SH) comprises fault detection, root cause analysis (RCA), and compensation. Within these, the automation of RCA activities is one of the key elements to reduce operational expenditures related to network management. In this article, an SH framework for next-generation networks using dimensionality reduction is proposed as the tool enabling the management of an increasingly complex network, taking advantage of both feature selection and feature extraction techniques. A proof of concept has been carried out in the context of automatic RCA in a live network. Results show that the proposed framework can effectively manage a high-dimensional environment from different data sources, eventually automating the tasks usually performed by troubleshooting experts while optimizing the performance of the RCA tool.",

      "abstract": "We propose a fog-cloud hybrid architecture that can support a massive ad hoc crowd composed of a massive social network and distributed IoT nodes around a smart city environment. The fog computing framework is introduced to support energy efficiency by incorporating IoT nodes that act as an interface to the ad hoc crowd, is aware of user contexts within its vicinity, can do real-time processing of user requests, supports a constrained amount of data offloading, and pass the geo-tagged multimedia data available from the subset of the ad hoc crowd to the big data repository in the cloud. The framework leverages a sustainable crowdsourcing incentive model for both the ad hoc crowd and the IoT infrastructure provider. The proposed sustainable framework can potentially support context-aware smart city services such as finding a lost person within the crowd, showing green and health risk prone zones, semantic and location-aware notifications of events of interest, semantic IoT-based routing, and dealing with emergency situations. We present a communication architecture between mobile users and fog nodes, and between fog nodes and the cloud, a sustainability and energy efficiency model, and massive geo-tagged, multimedia big data architecture.",

However, the associated infrastructure cost may become prohibitive. The evolving paradigm of network slicing can tackle such a challenge while optimizing the network resource usage, enabling multi-tenancy and facilitating resource sharing and efficient service-oriented communications. Indeed, network slicing in UDN deployments can offer the desired degree of customization in not only vanilla radio access network (RAN) designs, but also in the case of disaggregated multi-service RANs. In this article, we devise a novel multi-service RAN environment, RAN runtime, capable of supporting slice orchestration procedures and enabling flexible customization of slices as per tenant needs. Each network slice can exploit a number of services, which can be either dedicated or shared between multiple slices over a common RAN. The novel architecture we present concentrates on the orchestration and management systems. It interacts with the RAN modules, through the RAN runtime, via a number of new interfaces enabling a customized dedicated orchestration logic for each slice. We present results for a disaggregated UDN deployment where the RAN runtime is used to support slice-based multi-service chain creation and chain placement, with an auto-scaling mechanism to increase the performance.",

Since numerous IoT devices will be connected to cellular networks, the conflicting demands of ultra-low latency, massive connectivity and high reliability impose significant burdens on the operational wireless networks. Exploiting various temporarily unused computational and storage resources by invoking cooperative caching and computing has the potential of supporting these demanding applications. One of the key characteristics of next-generation networks is the boom of applications in social networking. By exploiting the benefits of social networking, the burdens imposed on wireless networks by the IoT applications can be mitigated by the proposed caching assisted collaborative computing IoT framework.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things services provision, by using machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, plays a critical role in today's ubiquitous systems. This service provision offers reliability and consistency to the end user. In many cases, there are secondary devices that are interconnected (glasses, set-top-boxes, home furniture, etc.), playing an active role in the level of QoS/QoE provided to end users. This is valid for any service demands, requested by end users on the move. The most important aspect of this kind of communication is to allow users to exploit continuous on-demand service provision, regardless of how demanding their running applications are. This is feasible to achieve by using schemes to support the edge devices. Considering the latter, this work presents and identifies the different ways to implement the edge computing paradigm by using M2M communications in dense networked systems via social connectivity from two different perspectives: the offered reliability for delay-tolerant (delay-sensitive) services and the energy conservation over reliability provision. Both perspectives introduce significant applications execution optimization when using delay-sensitive data. In such a case, the offloading social-based processing of selected applications to the edge devices, in terms of both time and energy, offers significant lifetime extensibility for each device as indicative results show.",

      "abstract": "Today's existing smart city research involves many overtly futuristic applications such as smart transportation, in which smart roads warn drivers of bad traffic conditions ahead, smart parking, which communicates the location of unoccupied parking spaces to drivers, and smart environment, which enables fully automated homes and workplaces to adjust their temperature to conserve energy. The realization of these applications hinges on a data acquisition structure that gathers its data from a countless number of sensors, either deployed for predefined tasks (hard sensing) or built into the mobile devices of smart city residents (soft sensing). At the core of this big data infrastructure lie the 5Vs: veracity, volume, velocity, variety, and value. The soft sensing component of a smart city sensing network is particularly affected by 3Vs: veracity, volume, and velocity. To address the unique challenges of big data, recommender systems, statistical reputation systems, and context analysis are used to ensure the veracity of acquired data, machine learning algorithms are applied to handle the data volume, and data analytics algorithms are implemented to manage data velocity. Despite its seemingly insurmountable size, the acquired data is highly redundant, and systematic use of machine intelligence and data analytics can facilitate processing by extracting only the relevant information; in this article, we study the role of these algorithms through the lens of the 3Vs in facilitating soft sensing within the framework of smart city applications.",

      "abstract": "The volume of data traffic has increased exponentially due to the explosive growth of IoT devices and the arrival of many new IoT applications. Due to the large volume of data generated from IoT devices, limited bandwidth, high latency, and realtime analysis requirements, the conventional centralized network architecture cannot meet users requirements. Intensive real-time data analysis is one of the major challenges in current state-ofthe- art centralized architectures due to the ubiquitous deployment of different types of sensors. To address the current challenges and adhere to the principles of architectural design, we are proposing a SoftEdgeNet model, which is a novel SDN-based distributed layered network architecture with a blockchain technique for a sustainable edge computing network. At the fog layer, we introduce an SDN-based secure fog node architecture to mitigate security attacks and provide real-time analytics services. We are also proposing a flow rule partition, and allocation algorithm at the edge of the network. The evaluation result shows our proposed model allows for a significant improvement of the interactions in real time data transmission. In terms of the ability to mitigate flooding attacks, the bandwidth is maintained above 9 Mb/s until the attack rates exceed 2000 PPS in the hardware environment and the bandwidth remained almost unchanged in the software environment. In the case of scalability of the proposed model, our proposed algorithm has performed better and proceeded linearly with the increase in traffic volume.",

      "abstract": "The advancement of the micro-electro-mechanical sensory industry and open source autopilot stacks, have dramatically reduced the cost and difficulty of making highly maneuverable UAVs. Such ease in flying drones has caused concerns about privacy, public safety, and security. One of the major threats is inadequate control of flying small drones over sensitive areas. In this research, we address this problem through a dual approach: detection and eviction. We propose a distributed system to identify the appearance and the approximate position of unwelcome drones using a wireless acoustic sensor network and machine learning algorithms. Next, we integrate software defined radio transceivers along with machine learning algorithm into a framework to specify and decode the UAV's telemetry protocols. Using decoded information, we can then send control commands to evict the trespassing drone away before sending aggressive surveillance UAVs.",

      "abstract": "Optical networks can support a large amount of IP traffic in the next generation of networks with energy efficiency awareness. However, the ever increasing demand of IP traffic also renders tremendous energy consumption in the next generation of networks. The traditional separate design for wireline and wireless networks cannot meet the demand of energy efficiency in the systems well. Fortunately, SDN provides effective leverage to transform such a separate design into a wireline-wireless cross-network design. In this article, through employing software defined cross-networks, the wired routing and wireless transmission can be controlled in an integrated and centralized way. Intelligent algorithms can thus be used for effective implementation of joint design with low delay, powerful control function of networks, and energy-efficient trade-off across the networks. However, it is challenging to find a suitable trade-off among energy efficiency, energy consumption, and traffic delays between wired and wireless networks. This motivates us to propose a novel and feasible integrated energy- efficient framework. We also provide several promising research directions for joint energy efficiency designs in the next generation of networks.",

As a huge number of networking and computing equipments that generate big data are integrated into the 5G system, energy efficiency becomes the major challenge in building a green 5G system. In this article, we propose a software-defined green 5G system for big data, which consists of three planes: the control plane, the data plane and the energy plane. The data plane contains networking and computing equipments, which can be powered by both traditional grid and renewable energy sources in the energy plane. The control plane monitors the system status and configures the corresponding equipments to achieve energy efficiency and quality-of-service. Furthermore, to reduce the overhead of this software- defined architecture, we investigate a FRS to eliminate redundant system monitoring information. To integrate features in software-defined architecture, we propose an AIFS to mine latent rules among features. Simulation results indicate that our proposals achieve higher efficiency in the green 5G system.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular networks have attracted much attention from both industry and academia. Due to the high-speed and complex network topology of vehicles, vehicular networks have become extremely challenging. The development of mobile communication technologies, such as SDN and FC, provides a great platform for vehicular networks. SDN separates the software plane and data plane, which enables efficient management and centralized control of vehicular networks. FC is an extension of cloud computing. By pushing significant storage, control, management, and communication mechanisms onto the network edge or user equipment, FC alleviates the pressure of the core network. Accordingly, we consider a novel SDFC-VeNET architecture in this article. Based on the SDFC-VeNET architecture, mobility management and resource allocation are discussed. Simulation results show the superiority of the presented SDFC-VeNET architecture, as well as the associated handover scheme and resource allocation mechanism. Furthermore, the existing challenges and open issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Spatial challenges for the vehicular Internet of Things come from mobility, high density, sparse connectivity, and heterogeneity. In this article, we propose two techniques, namely decentralized moving edge and multi-tier multi-access edge clustering, to handle these challenges. The \u201cvehicle as an edge\u201d concept of the decentralized moving edge provides a more suitable solution to meet the throughput and latency performance requirements by conducting distributed communication, data caching, and computing tasks at vehicles. Multi-tier multi-access edge clustering generates different levels of clusters for more efficient integration of different types of access technologies including licensed/unlicensed long-range low-throughput communications and unlicensed short-range high-throughput communications. We employ fuzzy logic to jointly consider multiple inherently contradictory metrics and use Q-learning to achieve a self-evolving capability. Realistic computer simulations are conducted to show the advantage of the proposed protocols over alternatives, and several open research problems are discussed.",

      "abstract": "High carrier frequencies are an integral part of the upcoming 5G mobile networks due to the available larger transmission bandwidths that offer high data rates and increase the quality of experience. To compensate for the high path loss at these frequencies, beamforming is applied, resulting in users connecting and switching between beams of the same or different cells. The current 3D channel models proposed for 5G are complex and have high computational complexity when used in user mobility investigations, which typically require long simulation time for collecting a statistically sufficient number of mobility events. From that perspective, simplified and computationally efficient channel models need to be developed that capture the relevant spatial and temporal correlations. Hence, the characteristics of the channel at these frequencies are investigated in this article for 28 GHz with respect to fast fading power envelope distribution, temporal variations, and spatial correlations among beams of the same cell. The investigations are carried out by simulating the 3GPP channel model defined in TR 38.901. Results reveal that for non-line-of-sight scenarios the beam signals follow, to some extent, similar statistical distribution and properties as conventional channel models (e.g., Jakes Doppler spectrum and Chi-square distribution for fast fading power envelope [1, 2]). Nevertheless, the distribution of the fast fading power envelope and autocorrelation function need to be adapted to consider the diversity gain resulting from multi-path and the increase in coherence time. The latter is caused by applying sectorization and beamforming that distort the uniform distribution of angle of arrival for the received ray, which may result in a reduced Doppler spread. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a spatial correlation between beams of the same cell, especially among those that are candidates for serving a user.",

      "abstract": "Massive MIMO, especially in the millimeter- wave frequency bands, has been recognized as a promising technique to enhance spectrum and energy efficiency, as well as network coverage for wireless communications. Most research in massive MIMO just uses the extended conventional MIMO channel model by directly assuming that the channel dimensionality becomes large. With massive numbers of antennas, however, there exists a non-negligible propagation delay across the large array aperture, which then causes a transmitted symbol to reach different antennas with different delays, thereby rendering conventional MIMO channel models inapplicable. Such a phenomenon is known as the spatial-wideband effect in the areas of array signal processing and radar signal processing, and introduces the beam squint effect in beamforming. However, the spatial-wideband effect and the related beam squint issue are seldom studied in massive MIMO communications. To design a practical massive MIMO system, it is important to understand when the spatial-wideband effect appears and how it affects signal transmission, how the spatial-wideband effect interacts with the frequency-wideband effect (frequency selectivity), especially for multi-carrier modulations such as orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM), and how we should re-design the transceiver. In this article we suggest a new massive MIMO channel model that embraces both the spatial- and frequency- wideband effects, and discuss these issues.",

      "abstract": "The recently proposed channel model by the Third Generation Partnership Project for fifth generation New Radio (5G-NR) systems at millimeter- wave carrier frequencies in TR38.901 provides a good starting point for understanding the impact of propagation, material penetration, and blockage in cellular access systems. With this backdrop, the focus of this article is on hand and body blockage which have a significant bearing on user equipment (UE) design and in the practical viability of millimeter-wave systems. Building on TR38.901, we first study hand and body blockage loss with experiments using a 28 GHz experimental prototype that emulates a 5G base station and a form-factor UE. These measurement estimates show that while blockage losses can be substantial, they are significantly lower than the agreed model in TR38.901. We then study the implications of these revised estimates on spherical coverage with the UE. For this, we consider two form-factor UE designs: a face design and an edge design. Our studies show that while both designs are generally comparable in terms of spherical coverage, practical design considerations favor the edge design over the face design. We finally report on the timescales at which blockage events occur and show that given the symbol periods in 5G-NR, it is possible to implement mitigation strategies to overcome blockage (e.g., switch beams at the UE from a blocked path to an unblocked path).",

There are various challenges, in terms of the spectral efficiency, data rates, average cell throughput, data latency, and connectivity density, on largescale IoT networks. To deal with those challenges, we explore the novel IoT network architecture and efficient spectrum management schemes to unlock 5G spectrum potential. In this article, we introduce an overview of the design principles for IoT architecture in relation to adaptability, performance, reliability, and scalability. Based on all of the design principles, a logical architecture is proposed, where both fog computing and network functions virtualization are taken into consideration for fog IoT networks. Furthermore, we provide two channel access schemes, as well as two spectrum allocation schemes based on the multi-armed bandit algorithm to increase spectrum efficiency and maximize economic revenues in unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results verify that the proposed spectrum management schemes significantly improve IoT network performance. Finally, several challenges in IoT networks are discussed, including network architecture, network technology, network security, and economic revenue.",

      "abstract": "The deployment of standalone LTE radio technology in unlicensed spectrum can enable new business cases, by leveraging the assets of LTE, to industry players not having access to licensed spectrum. With this objective in mind, the Multe- Fire Alliance has recently finalized the first release of the MulteFire standard specifications. MulteFire makes the deployment of standalone LTE radio technology possible in the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. It combines the simplicity of deployment of WiFi with the spectral efficiency and carrier- grade quality of LTE. MulteFire is targeted at enhanced mobile broadband services, but is also suited for IoT applications, as it inherently supports many connected devices. It also offers more reliable communication, as compared to competing technologies working in the unlicensed spectrum. This article provides an overview of the research challenges and solutions of deploying the LTE radio technology in unlicensed spectrum. We summarize the main regulatory requirements in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, and describe the needed modifications to the LTE specifications. We also demonstrate, by means of detailed system- level simulations, how MulteFire can improve the system capacity and coverage, as compared to WiFi, in specific propagation environments and small cell deployments.",

      "abstract": "A variety of recent studies have attempted to apply biologically inspired (bio-inspired) algorithms to distributed resource allocation problems because they promise to enable efficient decentralized communication. In this article, we discuss the key challenges of MANETs with respect to bandwidth utilization, fairness, scalability, QoS, energy efficiency, and mobility. We also provide an overview of the state of the art of bio-inspired algorithms for resource allocation and describe the key benefits of using bio-inspired resource allocation algorithms in order to solve the various challenges of MANETs. Using the underlying key features of such bio-inspired algorithms, we design and implement a framework for a bio-inspired MAC protocol suited to MANETs and evaluate its performance. A simulation verifies that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms the existing MAC protocols in terms of throughput, delay, fairness, overhead, and energy efficiency. Finally, we discuss open issues associated with application of bio-inspired algorithms to resource allocation in MANETs.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, are recently gaining increased research attention across various fields due to their flexibility and application potential. The steady increase in the number of amateur drones demands more stringent regulations on their allowed route, mass, and load. However, these regulations may be violated accidentally or deliberately. In these cases, spying with drones, transfer of dangerous payloads, or losing reliable drone control can represent a new hazard for people, governments, and business sector. The technologies to detect, track, and disarm possible aerial threats are therefore in prompt demand. To this end, ubiquitous cellular networks, and especially 5G infrastructures based on the use of millimeter-wave radio modules, may be efficiently leveraged to offer the much needed drone detection capabilities. In this work, we propose to exploit 5G millimeter-wave deployments to detect violating amateur drones. We argue that the prospective 5G infrastructure may provide all the necessary technology elements to support efficient detection of small-sized drones. We therefore outline a novel technology and system design perspective, including such considerations as the density of base stations, their directional antennas, and the available bandwidth, among others, as well as characterize their impact with our ray-based modeling methods.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes an architecture and methodology for ultra-high-speed DSL connectivity. Known measurements of single-wire copper waveguide modes are extrapolated to a multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) or, equivalently, \"Vectored DSL\" model for a binder of twisted pairs. These modes use sub-millimeter- wave and millimeter-wave frequency bands, and leverage some of the work and exciting positive results in next-generation wireless systems to address coupling and excitation of the waveguide modes. Projections beyond the known regimes indicate that significantly higher speeds may be achieved than any current DSLs that use the transmission- line method. Some consideration of practical twisted-pair effects and projected associated complexity are also provided. This work's intent is encouragement and motivation of other researchers to further investigate and evaluate these projections.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the basic system architecture for THz wireless links with bandwidths of more than 50 GHz into optical networks. New design principles and breakthrough technologies are required in order to demonstrate terabit- per-second data rates at near zero latency using the proposed system concept. Specifically, we present the concept of designing the baseband signal processing for both the optical and wireless links and using an E2E error correction approach for the combined link. We provide two possible electro-optical baseband interface architectures, namely transparent optical-link and digital- link architectures, which are currently under investigation. THz wireless link requirements are given as well as the main principles and research directions for the development of a new generation of transceiver front-ends that will be capable of operating at ultra-high spectral efficiency by employing higher-order modulation schemes. Moreover, we discuss the need for developing a novel THz network information theory framework, which will take into account the channel characteristics and the nature of interference in the THz band. Finally, we highlight the role of PBF, which is required in order to overcome the propagation losses, as well as the physical layer and medium access control challenges.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we introduce the concept of FoT, a paradigm for on-demand IoT. On-demand IoT is an IoT platform where heterogeneous connected things can be accessed and managed via a uniform platform based on real-time demands. Realizing such a platform faces challenges including heterogeneity, scalability, responsiveness, and robustness, due to the large-scale and complex nature of an IoT environment. The FoT paradigm features the incorporation of fog computing power, which empowers not only the IoT applications, but more importantly the scalable and efficient management of the system itself. FoT utilizes a flat-structured virtualization plane and a hierarchical control plane, both of which extend to the network edge and can be reconfigured in real time, to achieve various design goals. In addition to describing the detailed design of the FoT paradigm, we also highlight challenges and opportunities involved in the deployment, management, and operation of such an on-demand IoT platform. We hope this article can shed some light on how to build and maintain a practical and extensible control back-end to enable large-scale IoT that empowers our connected world.",

      "abstract": "The Japanese standardization systems played an important role in the growth of Japanese industries and economy after the Second World War. The roles of the Japanese standardization systems, in particular the Japanese Industrial Standards system, have historically adapted in accordance with technological advances and changes in industry and social structures. The standardization systems still have a significant role in the current global and interconnected economy. This article reviews historical roles of the Japanese standardization systems, and describes current opportunities and challenges of the standardization systems including the recent revision of the Industrial Standardization Act of Japan. This article also addresses treatment of intellectual property rights in standards, and briefly introduces some standardization systems in Japan other than the JIS system.",

Focus is on a standardized 5G architecture that includes the underlying 3GPP components but also the ETSI network functions virtualization management and orchestration capabilities. The truly innovative character of 5G enabling fundamental changes to architecture and implementation is discussed, as well as details of monitoring and orchestration approaches that are deemed instrumental in unlocking the full potential of 5G. Finally, it is important to us to share the lessons learned, which we hope are of use to industry and academia alike when building, deploying, and testing emerging 5G systems.",

This change has extended the potential of the IoT. Many early IoT devices could only collect and send data for analysis. However, the increasing computing capacity of today's devices allow them to perform complex computations on-site, resulting in edge computing. Edge computing extends cloud computing capabilities by bringing services close to the edge of a network and thus supports a new variety of services and applications. In this work, we investigate, highlight, and report on recent advances in edge computing technologies with respect to measuring their impact on IoT. We establish a taxonomy of edge computing by classifying and categorizing existing literature, and by doing so, we reveal the salient and supportive features of different edge computing paradigms for IoT. Moreover, we present the key requirements for the successful deployment of edge computing in IoT and discuss a few indispensable scenarios of edge computing in IoT. Several open research challenges are also outlined.",

Mobile networks offer wide-area, high-speed, and secure wireless connectivity, which can enhance control and safety of UAV operations and enable beyond visual LOS use cases. In this article, we share some of our experience in LTE connectivity for low-altitude small UAVs. We first identify the typical airborne connectivity requirements and characteristics, highlight the different propagation conditions for UAVs and mobiles on the ground with measurement and ray tracing results, and present simulation results to shed light on the feasibility of providing LTE connectivity for UAVs. We also present several ideas on potential enhancements for improving LTE connectivity performance and identify fruitful avenues for future research.",

In this article, we introduce a potential architecture of STIN that integrates the extended space network, the Internet, and mobile wireless networks to provide comprehensive services and global anytime anywhere network access. The extended space network, being the most complex component of STIN, consists of the space-backbone of several GEO satellites, the terrestrial backbone of data centers and ground access nodes, and the space access network comprised of various satellites at different orbits and other space objects. We present a number of key technical challenges associated with STIN, including physical-layer transmission technologies, network protocols, routing, resource management, security, and test-bed development.",

      "abstract": "Ethernet is cheap and ubiquitous. As such, people want to use it to carry all sorts of traffic for which it was not originally intended. A popular current application area is the transport of multiple flows of data, each having different timing requirements. Such applications exist in professional audio, industrial and automotive networks, among others. This article briefly traces the history of the features of IEEE 802 Bridging intended to address those needs, and then describes recent advances in time-sensitive networking in more detail. As well as completed standards, some current projects are described. Areas for future standardization are identified. Encoding the priority of packets in the header allows high-priority packets to be scheduled for transmission ahead of lower-priority packets, providing a better quality of service for urgent traffic. Time-sensitive flows have varying requirements for maximum latency and latency variation. Audio-video bridging provides guaranteed quality of service in terms of those parameters, for booked traffic in a bridged network comprising only compliant bridges. Some types of flow (particularly in industrial networks) are very sensitive to packet loss. Time-sensitive networking can provide bounded latency and zero packet loss due to congestion. The most stringent guarantees and most efficient use of network resources is provided by cyclic queuing and forwarding, which combines time synchronization, transmission scheduling and per-stream filtering and policing to provide just-in-time delivery of time-sensitive streams. This requires careful planning and centralized control. Less stringent use cases allow use of distributed control techniques.",

The Industrial Internet of Things integrates the key technologies of industrial communication, computing, and control, and is providing a new way for a wide range of manufacturing resources to optimize management and dynamic scheduling. In this article, OLE for process control technology, software defined industrial network, and device-to-device communication technology are proposed to achieve efficient dynamic resource interaction. Additionally, the integration of ontology modeling with multiagent technology is introduced to achieve dynamic management of resources. We propose a load balancing mechanism based on Jena reasoning and Contract-Net Protocol technology that focuses on intelligent equipment in the smart factory. Dynamic resources management for IoT-based manufacturing provides a solution for complex resource allocation problems in current manufacturing scenarios, and provides a technical reference point for the implementation of intelligent manufacturing in Industry 4.0.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of smart city initiatives in many areas of the world has led to rapid development and proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Successful deployments of IoT have resulted in the military looking at the impacts and benefits of IoT, both for directly leveraging IoT within the military environment as well as to interface with smart city environments for urban operations such as humanitarian assistance and disaster response. This article describes some of the outcomes of the NATO IST-147 Research Task Group that was established to explore the military applications of IoT. Within the NATO context, the concept of federated mission networks (FMNs) enables coalition partners to plan, prepare, establish, use, and terminate mission networks in support of federated operations. In this article, we propose an architecture and data model to enable interoperability between FMN and IoT networks in smart city environments. We review the various bottlenecks involved for such an environment and how a reference implementation can be set up to allow multiple partners to exchange data for sharing resources and provide better situational awareness. The concepts discussed reuse and improvise upon the existing NATO and commercial IoT standards for faster adoption. Finally, open research challenges are discussed as future research directions.",

As a result, it is predicted that intelligent devices and networks, including WSNs, will become the new interfaces to support future IoT applications. However, many open challenges remain, which are mostly due to the resource constraints imposed by various hardware platforms and complex characteristics of applications wishing to make use of IoT systems. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the current approaches incorporating both computing and communications in this area can be improved, and at the same time better understand the opportunities for the research community to utilize the proposed approaches. To this end, this article presents an overview of our latest research results in sensor edge computing and lightweight communication protocols as well as their potential applications.",

      "abstract": "Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as an efficient method of radio resource sharing has its roots in network information theory. For generations of wireless communication systems design, orthogonal multiple access schemes in the time, frequency, or code domain have been the main choices due to the limited processing capability in the transceiver hardware, as well as the modest traffic demands in both latency and connectivity. However, for the next generation radio systems, given its vision to connect everything and the much evolved hardware capability, NOMA has been identified as a promising technology to help achieve all the targets in system capacity, user connectivity, and service latency. This article provides a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art design of the NOMA transmission based on a unified transceiver design framework, the related standardization progress, and some promising use cases in future cellular networks, based on which interested researchers can get a quick start in this area.",

      "abstract": "Driven by enormous traffic demand, traditional cellular networks are evolving into an ultra-dense architecture. To take full advantage of such an ultra-dense architecture and efficiently serve the traffic with spatiotemporal fluctuation, the transmission mechanisms should be redesigned under the constraints of backhaul and energy consumption. In this article, we summarize and classify the spatiotemporal arrival properties of different traffic in ultra-dense networks, and optimize several promising technologies, such as dynamic time-division duplexing and full duplex radio, to adapt the network service to match the traffic. A new approach based on combining stochastic geometry and queueing theory is proposed to provide a useful guidance for the design of ultra-dense networks when the traffic is spatiotemporally fluctuating. Successive efforts, such as the analysis of different QoS requirements and more complicated but practical scenarios, still require attention along this line of research.",

      "abstract": "Many industries, including the automotive industry and industrial automation, have a need for reliable real-time communication. To satisfy this need, industry-specific, often proprietary, solutions have been developed in recent decades. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is addressing a grand unification of these existing technologies to leverage cross-industry cost efficiency as well as to guarantee a stable growth path of communication capabilities. While the functionality of time-sensitive networking is exhaustively standardized in IEEE 802.1, configuration standards for TSN are largely missing. Thus, in this article we review the IEEE TSN standards, in particular 802.1Qbv, and continue to illustrate a reference model for traffic planning for time-sensitive communication. Furthermore, the article references a detailed technical report describing the complete model, which is ideally suited as a starting point for standardization and ensures the interoperability of future TSN traffic planning tools.",

Class-based QoS provisioning mechanisms, such as the EDCA function of IEEE 802.11, are particularly prone to traffic remapping attacks, which may bring an attacker better QoS without exposing it to easy detection. Such attacks have been studied in wireless LANs, whereas their impact in multihop settings is less known. We provide a definition of traffic remapping attacks, highlighting their ease of execution, and analyze their impact in multihop networks. Suitable detection methods and defense measures are also discussed and evaluated.",

Conventional relay-assisted FSO systems, however, are designed around two basic assumptions: relays are buffer-free, and relays are stationary. This article proposes to improve the performance of the existing relay-assisted FSO systems by relaxing both of these highly restrictive assumptions through the integration of UAVs as buffer-aided moving relays into the conventional relay-assisted FSO systems. Specifically, two possible simple integration scenarios are proposed and analyzed through simulation. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the great potential associated with the proposed highly promising, innovative, hybrid FSO architecture. Given that high performance gains are observed under small buffer sizes, it becomes conceivable to employ buffer-aided moving relaying UAVs to serve a variety of other purposes. This includes, for instance, having these UAVs oversee the operation of amateur drones for potential misbehavior or wrongdoing within the area of their deployment.",

      "abstract": "Ultra-dense heterogeneous networks (Ud-HetNets) have been put forward to improve the network capacity for next-generation wireless networks. However, counter to the 5G vision, ultra-dense deployment of networks would significantly increase energy consumption and thus decrease network energy efficiency, suffering from the conventional worst case network design philosophy. This problem becomes particularly severe when Ud-HetNets meet big data because of the traditional reactive request-transmit service mode. In view of these, this article first develops a big-data-aware artificial- intelligence-based framework for energy-efficient operations of Ud-HetNets. Based on the framework, we then identify four promising techniques, namely big data analysis, adaptive base station operation, proactive caching, and interference- aware resource allocation, to reduce energy cost on both large and small scales. We further develop a load-aware stochastic optimization approach to show the potential of our proposed framework and techniques in energy conservation. In a nutshell, we devote our work to constructing green Ud-HetNets of big data with the abilities of learning and inferring by improving the flexibility of control from worst case to adaptive design and shifting the manner of services from reactive to proactive modes.",

      "abstract": "Intensive video and cloud computing services are putting much pressure on metro networks to meet stringent requirements such as low latency, low power consumption, and high spectral efficiency, where the system cost is sensitive. To address this challenge, we introduce a special elastic optical network paradigm called the ultradense wavelength switched network (UD-WSN) for metro optical networks. The architecture supports a spectrum granularity (e.g., 6.25 GHz or even 5 GHz) finer than the current smallest standardized 12.5 GHz, which enables more efficient spectrum utilization when provisioning metro low-speed service connections (e.g., sub-1G/1G/10G services). The performance of UD-WSN is evaluated from the techno-economic perspective in comparison with the conventional OTN over DWDM network. Case studies demonstrate the merits of the proposed architecture. Considering the promising potential of UD-WSN, we also suggest several open research issues for it.",

Recently, 3GPP TS 22.261, TR 22.862, and TR 36.777 have specified performance requirements for communications between multiple UAVs in the 5G domain. This article discusses communications reliability challenges in a UAV swarm context. Recommendations for designing an ultra-reliable communications system for UAV swarms are introduced with a focus on the software protocol stack and RF hardware. For the purpose of demonstration, we developed Easy- Swarm, an open-source UAV swarming platform that adopts the LoRa radio at the physical layer and a low-latency channel access protocol at the MAC layer. Real-life testbeds are built consisting of 10 UAVs and 20 robotic cars that produce background traffic. LoRa, WiFi and LTE networks are employed to provide broadband and cellular wireless network support. Results show that using LoRa leads to better reliability, in particular allowing for higher swarm density and longer coverage distance, than when WiFi is used. In addition, LTE provides the best reliability and latency for UAV swarms with good network connectivity.",

This article first introduces three emerging mission critical applications of URLLC and identifies their requirements on end-to-end latency and reliability. We then investigate the various sources of end-to-end delay of current wireless networks by taking 4G LTE as an example. Then we propose and evaluate several techniques to reduce the end-to-end latency from the perspectives of error control coding, signal processing, and radio resource management. We also briefly discuss other network design approaches with the potential for further latency reduction.",

      "abstract": "Amateur drones are enjoying great popularity in recent years due to the wide commercial diffusion of small, rather low-cost devices. More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones. This situation brings up the problem of keeping unauthorized drones away from private or sensitive areas, where they can represent a personal or public threat. With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.",

      "abstract": "Widespread use of white light-emitting diodes and ubiquitous smart devices offer the opportunity to establish VLC, which has become a hot research topic based on the growing number of publications over the last decade. Camera-based VLC, namely OCC, provides many unique features when compared to a single-photodiode-based system, such as the ability to separate incident light in the spatial and color domains. OCC technology represents a promising approach to utilize the benefits of VLC in beyond-5G scenarios and is one of the key technologies of the Internet of Things. Establishing a long communication channel in OCC, as well as non-flickering illumination by using low-frame-rate camera detectors, requires special modulation schemes. This article provides an overview of the principles of three categories of modulation schemes for OCC systems using a low-frame-rate camera detector. In addition, a series of undersampled modulation schemes are proposed and discussed to achieve flicker-free OCC with higher spectral efficiency. In addition, framing structures are designed to solve problems occurring in OCC systems using particular modulation schemes. To evaluate the performance of these modulation schemes, measured bit error rate values are shown. Finally, challenges in the implementation of OCC systems are also outlined.",

Leveraging recent availability of large amounts of diverse crowdsensed data, many studies have made contributions to this field in various aspects. They need proper review and summary. In this article, therefore, we first review these recent studies with a proper taxonomy with corresponding examples. Then, based on the experience learned from the studies, we provide a comprehensive tutorial for future research, which introduces and discusses popular crowdsensed data types, different human mobility subjects, and common data preprocessing and analysis methods. Special emphasis is placed on the matching between data types and mobility subjects. Finally, we present two research projects as case studies to demonstrate the entire process of understanding urban human mobility through crowdsensed data on a city-wide scale and a building-wide scale, respectively. Beyond demonstration purposes, the two case studies also make contributions to their category of certain crowdsensed data types and mobility subjects.",

      "abstract": "Underwater systems for ocean exploration and monitoring consist of a mix of geographically distributed stationary infrastructure and mobile units. The stationary infrastructure could be bottom-anchored nodes and surface buoys that are connected to a control center via cables and in-air radio links. Both the stationary and mobile units can be equipped with acoustic communication modules for underwater wireless data transmission. With the backbone (cable or radio) connection, those acoustic communication modules naturally form an underwater DAS. Similar to the DAS in terrestrial radio networks, the underwater DAS supports larger acoustic communication coverage and higher network throughput compared to the CAS. Furthermore, the characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, such as the frequency-dependent signal absorption loss and the low sound speed in water, lead to unique design challenges and unforeseen opportunities in the underwater DAS. This article examines both theoretical and system design issues pertaining to the underwater DAS, including operation strategies, communication algorithms and mobile node positioning, and pinpoints future research directions to fully realize its potentials.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of IoT is driving rapid growth in the use of wireless devices around the world. In addition, 5G, through its support for large numbers of devices, is expected to unleash the full potential of IoT globally. The growing number of wireless devices and the massive traffic stemming from the emergence of these technologies will result in a dramatic increase in the demand for spectrum resources. Dynamic spectrum sharing, enabled through cognitive radio network technology, emerges as a key solution for coping with these rising spectrum demands. One important approach that is currently being adopted as a potential solution for promoting dynamic spectrum sharing is the deployment and reliance on white space geo-location spectrum databases for locating spectrum availability in the TV white space. Despite the great benefits these databases offer in terms of their ability to help locate spectrum opportunities for secondary usage, they suffer from location privacy issues, as users need to reveal their location in the process of querying these databases for spectrum availability. Knowing that their whereabouts may be exposed, users can be discouraged from querying the databases, thereby hindering the adoption and deployment of this technology in future generation networks. In this article, we focus on the location privacy problem in database-driven dynamic spectrum access. Specifically, we present and compare key approaches that aim to protect the location information of secondary users in database-driven spectrum sharing and discuss some key research challenges that remain unaddressed.",

Thus, the air quality in cities exerts critical influence on the health status of more and more urban residents. In this article, based on urban air quality data collected through meteorological sites, mobile crowdsourcing, and IoT sensing, along with users' body signals, we propose an urban healthcare big data system named UH-BigDataSys. In this article, we first introduce a method of integrating multi-source air quality data for the data preparation of artificial-intelligence- based smart urban services. Then a testbed of UH-BigDataSys is set up with the deployment of air-quality-aware healthcare applications. Finally, we provide health guidance for urban residents in aspects of respiratory diseases, outdoor travel, sleep quality, and so on. The ultimate goal of UH-BigDataSys is for urban residents to lead healthier lives.",

In particular, a unified NOMA framework is proposed, including power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA, which can be configured flexibly to serve different application scenarios. As a further advance, unified NOMA framework enabled HUDNs are further investigated, with particular focus on user association and resource allocation. Two case studies are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness of unified NOMA enabled HUDNs.

      "abstract": "Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) constitute one of the most promising techniques for supporting the 5G mobile system. By deploying more small cells in a fixed area, the average distance between users and access points can be significantly reduced; hence, dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However, severe interference is the major obstacle in UDNs. Most contributions deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This article advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDNs, thanks to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN, centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission. We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with special emphasis on the application of big data techniques.",

      "abstract": "The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has lead to increased possibilities for novel human-centric services in smart cities. Nevertheless, existing IoT platforms for smart cities do not provide the means for integrating data and services from different IoT deployments, which is a prerequisite for several smart city applications such as holistic urban planning, tracking of city-wide APIs and integration of deployments at the level of neighbourhoods or communities in the cities. Hence, smart city projects tend to be fragmented, leading to disaggregated application silos. In order to alleviate this fragmentation and enable more integrated applications, there is a need to enable city authorities and application developers to see IoT systems as part of an integrated whole, allowing optimal use of existing infrastructure and achieving more than what these independent systems can do in isolation. This article presents the VITAL-OS, an IoT operating system for smart cities that facilitates access and control of the city infrastructure, resources and sensor networks, with abstraction and tools that can additionally be used by developers to create new applications using available data to empower citizens. VITAL-OS facilitates the semantic interoperability of diverse vertical IoT deployments in smart cities and enables integrated management of IoT resources as well as rapid development of cross-platform and cross-context IoT applications for smart cities. In this way, VITAL-OS provides a unique value proposition when compared to conventional IoT platforms for smart cities.",

      "abstract": "Embedded with advanced sensors, cameras, and processors, the emerging automated driving vehicles are capable of sensing the environment and conducting automobile operation, paving the way to modern intelligent transportation systems with high safety and efficiency. On the other hand, vehicular communication networks (VCNs) connect vehicles, infrastructures, clouds, and all other devices with communication modules, whereby vehicles can obtain local and global information to make intelligent operation decisions. Although sensing-based automated driving technologies and VCNs have been investigated independently, their interactions and mutual benefits are still underdeveloped. In this article, we argue that VCNs have attractive potential to enhance onboard sensing-based automated vehicles from different perspectives, such as driving safety, transportation efficiency, as well as customer experience. A case study is conducted to demonstrate that traffic jams can be relieved at intersections with automated driving vehicles coordinated with each other through VCNs. Furthermore, we highlight critical and interesting issues for future research, based on the specific requirements posed by automated driving in VCNs.",

      "abstract": "With the growing adoption of dash cameras, we are seeing great potential for innovations by analyzing the video collected from vehicles. On the other hand, transmitting and analyzing a large amount of video, especially high-resolution video in real time, requires a lot of communications and computing resources. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and challenges of applying vehicular fog computing for real- time analytics of crowdsourced dash camera video. Instead of forwarding all the video to the cloud, we propose to turn commercial fleets (e.g., buses and taxis) into vehicular fog nodes, and to utilize these nodes to gather and process the video from the vehicles within communication ranges. We assess the feasibility of our proposal in two steps. First, we analyze the availability of vehicular fog nodes based on a real-world traffic dataset. Second, we explore the serviceability of vehicular fog nodes by evaluating the networking performance of fog-enabled video crowdsourcing over two mainstream access technologies, DSRC and LTE. Based on our findings, we also summarize the challenges to largescale real-time analytics of crowdsourced videos over vehicular networks.",

      "abstract": "The virtual cell (VC) is an emergent concept in cellular networks that shifts the base-station-centric point of view to a user-centric one. Instead of a single base station, VCs consist of a number of transmission points with an association pattern that is created for, and moves with, every user in the network. A particularly challenging application of VCs is that of V2X communications, where V2X messages are broadcast to groups of vehicles. In this scenario, a VC is not created for a single device but for hotspots that move over time. In this article, we present a realization of the VC concept for V2X broadcast groups. The proposed solution consists of three optimization stages, which are admission control, transmission weight selection, and power control.",

In order to provide better suggestions for travelers, it is important to understand their preferences for venue types. In this article, we investigate travelers' preferences based on the check-in data collected from a popular location-based social application called Swarm. We conduct a thorough analysis of the check-in data to discover the variation in travelers' preferences between cities with different characteristics, and to build a model for predicting the venue types of travelers' interests in each city. Our experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score increases by 0.19 when taking into account the characteristics of the destination city. Moreover, our approach outperforms collaborative filtering, a widely used approach to the design of recommendation systems.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.",

It introduces a spectrum control plane that offers fine grained allocation of radio resources, flexible configuration of radio and wireless networking parameters, and continuous monitoring of the wireless network status. These features, along with the centralized nature of this architecture, can effectively address spectrum congestion which often occurs in unlicensed frequency bands. To demonstrate Wi-5's capabilities, we show results obtained from emulating various use case scenarios on our open source proof-of-concept.",

However, accurate detection and recognition of human behavior is still a big challenge that attracts a lot of research effort. Recent advances in wireless technology (e.g., Wi-Fi channel state information, i.e., CSI) enable a new behavior recognition paradigm, which is able to recognize behaviors in a device-free and non-intrusive manner. In this article, we first provide an overview of the basics of Wi-Fi CSI-based behavior recognition. Afterward, we classify related applications into three granularities, signals, actions, and activities, and then provide some insights for designing new schemes. Finally, we conclude by discussing the challenges, possible solutions to these challenges, and some open issues involved in CSI-based behavior recognition.",

      "abstract": "Efficient and flexible use of spectrum will be inherent characteristics of 5G communication technologies with native support of wideband operation with frequency reuse 1 (i.e., all transmit sites use all available frequency resources). Although not in the very first 5G release of 3GPP, it is expected that broadcast/multicast technology components will later be added and fully integrated in the 5G system. The combination of both wideband and frequency reuse 1 may provide significant gains for broadcast transmissions in terms of energy efficiency, since it is more efficient to increase capacity by extending the bandwidth rather than increasing the transmit power over a given bandwidth. This breaks with the traditional concept of terrestrial broadcast frequency planning, and paves the way to new potential uses of UHF spectrum bands for 5G broadcasting. This article provides insight into the fundamental advantages in terms of capacity, coverage, as well as power saving of wideband broadcast operation. The role of network deployment, linked to frequency reuse in the UHF band, and its influence on the performance of a wideband broadcasting system are discussed. The technical requirements and features that would enable such a power-efficient solution are also addressed.",

      "abstract": "The ability to decipher brain functions and understand the neuronal communication networking properties to develop innovative solutions to treat neurodegenerative diseases remains one of the biggest challenges in biomedicine. Since the early days, numerous solutions have been proposed for BMI, largely concentrating on the use of tethered electrodes that are inserted into the brain to either stimulate or suppress neural activities. In recent years, the field of optogenetics has provided a new alternative of utilizing light to stimulate genetically engineered neurons. While the original approach proposed the use of tethered optical cables inserted into the skull to transfer light into the brain for stimulation, numerous advances have been made to incorporate wireless technologies that will allow these devices to be attached to the skull or implanted in the brain. This article presents a review on the current technologies that have been proposed for different wireless optogenetics solutions, ranging from devices that are head mounted to miniature devices that can be embedded deep in the brain. We focus on a comparative analysis of the architecture and structure of the devices, the wireless technology used for signaling to the unit, as well as the energy consumption profile for each of the devices. Finally, the article presents future challenges to further miniaturize wireless optogenetic devices, concentrating specifically on the communication properties.",

      "abstract": "In a smart factory environment, a much larger amount of data is transmitted in the workshop networks bringing big challenges to data transfer capability and energy usage efficiency. In the workshop, two main networks (i.e., wired/wireless fieldbus networks and wireless sensor networks) are usually used to collect and transmit data separately; thus, this work proposes to integrate these two networks by also taking advantage of the existing mobile intelligences in smart factories, such as automatic guided vehicles, to implement a novel data and materials delivery scheme well suited for modern industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). In particular, data collected by sensor nodes can be transferred to nearby fieldbus nodes first; then all data in fieldbus nodes can be handled according to different priorities. High-priority data are still transferred to the central base station through fieldbus while low-priority data are delivered through mobile intelligence by solving a materials and data delivery problem. Simulation experiments demonstrate how the proposed approach, running within the IWSN, significantly increases data delivery efficiency, also achieving better energy usage by five times compared to separate networks without any mobile intelligence support.",

      "abstract": "In many IoT applications, there is a need to transmit the data collected by smart things to the cloud. The emerging SPS is one such system. Manufacturers/vendors have great interest in collecting data on their products for analysis and to enhance the overall smartness of the community. One obstacle is how to transmit the data from the things to the cloud. Rather than infiltrating other access networks for data transmission (e.g., a WiFi network in a building), a self-contained solution is preferred. It should be noted that many smart things are low-priced, making it impossible for them to afford the readily available channels (e.g., 3G/4G). To support this need, the industry is actively developing less expensive wireless communication channels. Unfortunately, the number of available choices in wireless communication channels is limited. However, the requirements of IoT applications for different costs and data rates are significantly more diversified. In this article, we address this problem by proposing Sharing Tube (sTube), an architecture for IoT communication channel sharing. Intrinsically, a greater number of smart things can share a smaller number of dedicated channels. We present the design and a case implementation of sTube. Our evaluation results demonstrate that sTube can achieve a cost saving of more than one order compared to a dedicated thing-to-cloud communication choice. This clears a core obstacle for many IoT applications in connecting to the cloud.",
