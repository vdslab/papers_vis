   "abstract": "This article investigates the slicing concept in the 5G RAN with the related challenges and research problems. The objective is to identify the plausible options for implementing the slicing concept at the RAN level by the mobile network operator to respond to the needs of verticals. We start by identifying the different slice granularity options, that is, how to define slices by combining customer and service needs. We then present how the 5G NR features can be used for facilitating slice implementation and provide typical configurations for different slice types from technology and RAN architecture perspectives. The main challenges for RAN slicing are then discussed, with special attention to the resource allocation problem between slices sharing the same spectrum band. We also investigate the multi-tenant slicing implementation in terms of the openness of the network to third parties, which is regarded as a key issue that may encourage vertical players to use operators' networks rather than deploying their own infrastructure.",

   "abstract": "Factory automation (FA) applies ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) to support closed-loop control systems with millisecond cycle times. Presently, many of these applications rely on maintenance-prone wireline bus systems since existing wireless technologies cannot meet the stringent latency and outage requirements. The cellular standards body, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), aims to change this predicament by incorporating support for FA and URLLC into the fifth generation (5G) communication networks. We investigate how combining operation in the unlicensed and licensed band can appropriately balance the technical, regulatory and economic constraints to enable large-scale deployments of bandwidth-hungry FA applications. We present 5G physical layer/MAC layer (PHY/MAC) designs, which carry the bulk of traffic in the cost-effective unlicensed band but switch to the licensed band within the available latency budget to circumvent unlicensed-band interference. We discuss design trade-offs between licensed band occupation, link outage and transmission power level.",

   "abstract": "IoT applications constitute one of the fastest developing areas in today's technology and at the same time pose the most demanding challenges for the respective radio access network design. While the initial studies in IoT were focused primarily on scaling the existing radio solutions for higher numbers of small-data and low-cost sensors, the current developments aim at supporting wearable augmented/virtual reality platforms, moving industrial robots, driving (semi-)autonomous vehicles, and flying drones, which produce large amounts of data. To satisfy these rapidly growing performance demands, the 5G-grade IoT is envisioned to increasingly employ millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where wider bandwidths promise to enable higher data rates and low-latency communication. While the mainstream trend in mmWave-based IoT is to rely on licensed bands around 28 GHz or leverage unlicensed bands at 60 GHz, in this work we introduce a conceptual vision for the integrated use of these frequencies within a single radio access system named 5G over unlicensed spectrum or 5G-U. We study the performance of 5G-U in supporting stringent IoT use cases, discuss and compare the alternative strategies for spectrum management in 5G-U, and demonstrate that a harmonized utilization of licensed and unlicensed bands provides notable performance improvements in both device-centric and network-centric metrics. Finally, we offer useful guidelines for future implementations of 5G-U and detail its potential applications in the area of advanced IoT services.",

   "abstract": "The increased carrier bandwidth and the number of antenna elements expected in 5G networks require a redesign of the traditional IP-based backhaul and CPRI-based fronthaul interfaces used in 4G networks. We envision future mobile networks to encompass these legacy interfaces together with novel 5G RAN functional splits. In this scenario, a consistent transport network architecture able to jointly support backhaul and 4G/5G fronthaul interfaces is of paramount importance. In this article we present 5G-XHaul, a novel transport network architecture featuring wireless and optical technologies and a multi-technology software defined control plane, which is able to jointly support backhaul and fronthaul services. We have deployed and validated the 5G-XHaul architecture in a city-wide testbed in Bristol.",

   "abstract": "Low-power wireless technologies have been applied to industrial fields not only to monitor facilities but also to control them. There is a legitimate requirement to integrate low-power wireless networks with existing IP-enabled networks such as the Internet. The 6LoWPAN standard makes this happen easily by enabling low-power wireless networks to transport IPv6 packets. A challenge is that an IPv6 packet might not fit in a link-layer frame. The answer is fragmentation: the IPv6 packet is cut into fragments, each fitting in a frame. In a typical implementation, the IPv6 packet is fragmented and reassembled at every hop. Such per-hop reassembly causes low end-to-end reliability and high end-to-end latency. This article presents a new implementation technique that results in fragment forwarding without changing any of the standards. Simulation results show how, when going from per-hop reassembly to fragment forwarding, end-to-end reliability goes from 40 percent to 100 percent, memory requirements go from 1280 B to 160 B, and end-to-end latency is halved.",

   "abstract": "The telecom industry is moving from a \"horizontal\" service delivery model, where services are defined independent of their consumers, toward a \"vertical\" delivery model, where the provided services are tailored to specific industry sectors and verticals. In order to enable this transition, an end-to-end comprehensive 5G architecture is needed, with capabilities to support the use cases of the different vertical industries. A key feature of this architecture is the implementation of network slicing over a single infrastructure to provision highly heterogeneous vertical services, as well as a network slicing management system capable of handling simultaneous slices. On top of the network slicing technology, functionality needs to be devised to deploy the slices required by the different vertical players and provide them with a suitable interface to manage their slice. In this article, we design a 5G mobile network architecture to support vertical industries. The proposed architecture builds on ongoing standardization efforts at 3GPP and ETSI, and incorporates additional modules to provide enhanced MANO and control functionality as well as artificial-intelligence-based data analytics. On top of these modules, a service layer is provided to offer vertical players an easyto- use interface to manage their services.",

   "abstract": "Information-centric networking (ICN) supports efficient data provision and retrieval with in-network caching. The data life cycle over ICN includes atomic data collection, data publication, caching, and retrieval, suffering from various attacks, such as regulation violation and false claim. Existing solutions have not considered regulation compliance and typically focus on the protection of a specific procedure. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based data life cycle protection framework (BDLP), which exploits the transaction and smart contract to provide a trusted and neutral environment in ICN. In BDLP, a special type of node, a data dam blockchain node, is designed to locally control registration and restrict data flow, besides the function of a blockchain node. BDLP consists of five types of transactions (RegT, CollectT, PubT, PayT, and PunT) to achieve accountability and four types of smart contracts (PubSC, PaySC, AccSC, and RepSC) to achieve authentication, regulation compliance, and neutrality. We elaborate on the data retrieval procedure in BDLP and analyze its scalability, demonstrating that BDLP can achieve a low data retrieval permission delay.",

We describe this new, resource-centric architecture as an evolution of both fog/edge networking and active networks.

   "abstract": "In this article, we study feasibility issues of mission-critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), which is an evolution of a group communication service for public safety use. Along with the overall standardization of the MCPTT in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), distinguishing features of MCPTT are investigated in comparison with Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) PTT over cellular (PoC). Based on the requirements of MCPTT, we elaborate on various technologies that need to be leveraged for minimizing end-to-end latency in terms of both communications and application processes. To validate MCPTT in practice, we show not only the realization of MCPTT with a practical testbed but also the verification with key performance indicators defined in the 3GPP specification as performance metrics. The results from our proof of concept reveal that MCPTT can be a reasonable candidate for group communication, guaranteeing a sufficient level of survivability and immediacy beyond its potential.",

   "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless communication, sensing, computation and control technologies have paved the way for the development of a new era of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Demanded by the requirements of information-centric and data-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITS), it is of great significance to explore new paradigms of IoV in supporting large-scale, real-time, and reliable information services. In this article, we propose a hierarchical system architecture, which aims at synthesizing the paradigms of software defined networking and fog computing in IoV and best exploiting their synergistic effects on information services. Specifically, a four-layer architecture is designed, comprising the application layer, the control layer, the virtualization layer, and the data layer, with objectives of enabling logically centralized control via the separation of the control plane and the data plane; facilitating adaptive resource allocation and QoS oriented services based on network functions virtualization and network slicing, and enhancing system scalability, responsiveness, and reliability by exploiting the networking, computation, communication, and storage capacities of fog-based services. On this basis, we further analyze newly arising challenges and discuss future research directions by presenting a cross-layer protocol stack. Finally, for the proof of concept, we implement the system prototype and give two case studies in real-world IoV environments. The results of field tests not only demonstrate the great potential of the new architecture, but also give insight into the development of future ITS.",

   "abstract": "The installation of smart grids by utilities is driving the growth of the energy industry, allowing energy management systems (EMSs) to improve operational efficiency. Increasing consumers' interest in efficient energy consumption and distributed energy resources requires an EMS that can manage large numbers of powered devices within homes, buildings, and residential areas. An energy management agent (EMA) is a technology standard under development by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25/WG 1. The EMA standard offers convenient and intelligent energy management services while supporting interoperability for demand response signals to smart grids. As wireless providers transition toward 5G and optical networks, EMAs are evolving into powerful frameworks of interconnected EMAs associated with cloud and edge computing. This article proposes a hierarchical distributed architecture that combines the advantages of both hierarchical and distributed architectures. A hierarchical architecture provides large-scale information acquisition, communications, processing, and control for cooperative energy management in homes and grids through cloud computing, while a distributed architecture provides autonomous decision making capability with agent-based intelligence through edge computing. The experimental results demonstrate the substantial achievements of the proposed hierarchical distributed EMA framework based on an actual protocol and system implementation. Finally, this article introduces various opportunities for using this framework with selected emerging technologies in smart city environments.",

   "abstract": "The increasing population in the world forces humans to improve farm yields using advanced technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises.",

   "abstract": "IoT has evolved from an experimental to a backbone technology able to connect myriads of people, things, and services for a large range of businesses. At the same time, the emergence of SDN can ideally handle IoT challenges for elasticity, heterogeneity, and mobility, offering an architecture that abstracts decision making away from the data plane and providing a programmable network facility. Along these lines, we propose MINOS, a multi-protocol SDN platform for IoT that implements service awareness utilizing appropriate SDN abstractions and interfaces for logically centralized network control of diverse and resource-constrained IoT environments, two network protocols that are deployable and configurable on demand, and a GUI that provides a bespoke dashboard and a real-time visualization tool. Due to its components, MINOS enables experimentation with novel network control features and protocols that realize optimized routing over heterogeneous IoT nodes, application of real-time strategies as a response to dynamic network conditions, support of individual protocol configurations per node, and flexibility to accommodate new protocols and control algorithms. Our results demonstrate MINOS as an enabling platform for two protocols, CORAL-SDN and Adaptable-RPL, which, in comparison with the state-of-the-art IoT routing protocol RPL, improve the packet delivery ratio with relatively small control overhead.",

   "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is envisioned as one of the most prominent technologies for the Internet of Things. The recent release of BLE mesh has attracted interest from both the industrial and academic communities, with new proposals for optimizing its performance being published on a regular basis. However, the majority of these publications rely on analysis and simulations, potentially neglecting the effect of real-life environments and hardware limitations. Moreover, no framework is available to experimentally compare the performance of different mesh protocols on top of BLE. This article presents the design and implementation of a low-cost, modular, and fully automated testbed capable of running multiple mesh protocols. It is also remotely accessible for any third party interested in performing network experiments with it. Apart from discussing the testbed architecture, we provide results obtained from a measurement-driven comparison of two protocols that fit within BLE operation: flooding- and connection-based. These results show that there is a trade-off between the two approaches and that the optimal mesh protocol to use is application-dependent, which should be taken into consideration when heading towards the next release of BLE mesh.",

   "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is being widely adopted across commercial, governmental, and educational networking domains. However, teaching SDN-related concepts is a challenge due to the inherent nature of this paradigm, its detailed technological tools/skill sets, and the continual evolution of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. As a result, there is a growing need to support new initiatives to develop applied research and hands-on training methodologies. Accordingly, this article presents a framework that has been developed/evolved over the past few years for teaching and conducting research activities related to SDN. The key idea here is to leverage the close relationship between SDN, real-world ICT problems, and innovative services development. Thus, the proposed framework integrates actors, stakeholders, phases, and components, along with their interrelationships in an applied research environment. Some related research and development experiences from the application of this framework in Chile are also presented to highlight its contributions toward creating a wider knowledge base and benefiting society.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things has dramatically expanded its scope of applications in the last few years, reaching all areas of human activities, from biology to technology to social sciences. In the same way, IoT applications are becoming a driving force in the economy, playing a central role in many businesses. This scenario presents challenges in the teaching and designing of IoT applications due to its inherent multidisciplinary nature, with areas of knowledge ranging from electrical and computing engineering to those related to the target application to the business itself. In this article, we present a teaching methodology that relies on the project-based learning approach and makes use of a six-layer IoT Open Reference Model that covers all aspects of an IoT solution, from sensors to the end-user interface. The proposed methodology focuses on a complete understanding of the business behind the application and on the end-user needs. Following a top-down approach, from the business to the devices required to collect the necessary information, the approach allows students to have a complete view of all components involved in any IoT application. The proposed methodology has been applied in graduate and extension courses at the University of Campinas and has proven extremely useful.",

   "abstract": "Constant expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates considerable convenience for peoples' daily lives; however, it also brings about some challenges. Advanced modern techniques equip IoT devices with additional sensory and communication modules, enabling them to perform more functions than just sensing, but it also means that these devices may consume more energy. Many IoT devices are powered by batteries of limited life and composed of electronic parts of limited capacity. Therefore, energy efficiency is an essential requirement for any IoT device with limited resources in terms of storage space, power, and computing capability. Moreover, possible attack vectors and attack sources for vulnerabilities in the IoT environment present another great challenge for secure user authentication. To address the above issues, in this article we propose a privacy- preserving lightweight biometric system, specifically designed for resource-limited IoT devices to save memory and computational cost. The proposed system employs a block logic operation based algorithm to reduce the biometric feature size in a simple and efficient way. Experimental results demonstrate that with a much reduced feature size, the proposed lightweight biometric system still maintains high recognition accuracy. It is worth noting that any sizable reduction in memory and computing cost is beneficial for resource-constrained IoT devices.",

   "abstract": "This article introduces the design of a secure sign-on protocol, SSP, for smart homes built on named data networking (NDN). Instead of depending on cloud services, NDN supports a new smart home model where each home IoT system is identified by a unique name and has a local trust anchor. To securely sign into such a home, a new device must acquire two certificates to secure its communications thereafter: the local trust anchor's certificate, whereby the device can cryptographically authenticate others in the same home, and its own certificate signed by the trust anchor to certify the device's identity and authenticity. SSP is designed for resource-constrained devices and built on NDN's security framework and Interest/Data exchange communication semantics, and is able to automate the process for a device to obtain those two certificates based on a piece of pre-shared information between the anchor and the device. Our security analysis and prototype implementation show that SSP offers strong protection against attacks even if the preshared secret is leaked later. We also discuss how SSP can be simplified and further enhanced for more resourceful devices.",

   "abstract": "The multi-access edge computing (MEC) architectural model has fostered the development of new human-driven edge computing (HEC) frameworks that extend the coverage of traditional MEC solutions leveraging people roaming around with their devices. HEC is a well-suited architecture for human-centered technologies such as mobile crowdsensing (MCS) as it allows conveying and distributing sensing tasks at the edges of the network, also enabling (local) sensing data collection from devices. This article, through the joint use of HEC and MCS paradigms, introduces a new social-driven edge computing architecture based on incentives and centrality measures. The core idea is to add social MEC (SMEC) nodes to complement the traditional edge nodes (i.e., the main actors of the middle layer of the standard MEC architecture), acting as bridges between other devices and the cloud. The principle that underlies the SMEC selection is based on the attitude of the users in performing tasks and on their measures of centrality. In addition, we report extensive experimental results based on co-location traces and cooperativeness scores extracted from the ParticipAct living lab, a well-known MCS dataset based on data collected between 2013 and 2015 from 170 students of the University of Bologna, that show how the selection based on centrality measurements returns greater benefits than simple selection based on cooperativeness scores.",

   "abstract": "The manufacturing industry is at the edge of the fourth industrial revolution, a paradigm of integrated architectures in which the entire production chain (composed of machines, workers, and products) is intrinsically connected. Wireless technologies can add further value in this manufacturing revolution. However, we identify some signs which indicate that wireless technology could be left out of the next generation of smart factory equipment. This is particularly relevant considering that the heavy machinery characteristic of this sector can last for decades. We argue that at the core of this issue there is a mismatch between industrial needs and the interests of academic and partly academic sectors (e.g., standardization bodies). We base our claims on surveys from renowned advisory firms and interviews with industrial actors, which we contrast with results from content analysis of scientific articles. Finally, we propose some convergence paths that, while still retaining the degree of novelty required for academic purposes, are more aligned with industrial concerns.",

To cope with this heterogeneity, the data center manager must coordinate a multitude of tools, protocols, and standards. Currently, data center managers, standardization bodies, and hardware/software manufacturers are joining efforts to develop and promote Redfish as the main hardware management standard for data centers, and even beyond the data center. The authors hope that this article can be used as a starting point to understand how Redfish and its extensions are being targeted as the main management standard for next-generation data centers.

   "abstract": "This article presents FORTIKA, an ongoing EU-funded project which is a resilient cyber-security solution that can easily be tailored and adjusted to the versatile and ever changing needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To fulfill its vision, FORTIKA adopts a security-by-design hybrid approach that adequately integrates hardware and software with business needs and behavioral patterns at the individual and organizational levels to introduce an FPGA-powered middleware security layer as an add-on to existing network gateways, orientating small business users to trusted cyber-security services (through FORTIKA's marketplace) packaged in tailored solutions for each enterprise, and further extended to accommodate security intelligence and encourage security-friendly behavioral and organizational changes. Finally, the introduction of a software-defined smart ecosystem in the FORTIKA marketplace provides the feature of a lightweight solution, which offers virtualized security services (with minimum downloading requirements). Users (i.e., SMEs) may utilize a variety of services and share profiling information with the service providers in return for tailored security services aligned with their actual needs. FORTIKA marketplace also functions as a single point of access for the profiling information for each SME. Preliminary evaluation results indicate that users can upload bundles to the marketplace repository in approximately 4 to 5 minutes, download bundles from the FORTIKA marketplace to the gateway in approximately 20 seconds, and deploy them in an average of 4.5 ms.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a two-stage boundary detection and refinement mechanism in Internet of Things sensing networks, where boundary faces are generated by adopting planarization algorithms based on sensory data provided by backbone nodes. Candidate edge nodes, which may be observed more appropriate to serve as inner or outer boundary nodes, are discovered leveraging their sensory data estimated through adopting spatial interpolation methods, and their sensory data are gathered by mobile nodes with certain time constraints. This boundary refinement procedure is conducted in an iteration fashion, until no candidate edge nodes exist in, and thus, the refinement can hardly be further conducted upon original boundary faces. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that this technique can generate a more accurate boundary region for continuous objects than the state of the art.",

   "abstract": "Speech is a common and effective approach for communication between humans and modern mobile devices such as smartphones or home hubs. The remarkable advances in computing and networking have popularized automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which can interpret received speech signals on mobile devices and enable us to remotely control and interact with those devices. Despite promising development, audio adversarial examples, a new kind of attack on advanced ASR systems, are found to be extremely effective in imitating human speech while fooling mobile devices to produce incorrect commands. In this article, we provide a systematic survey of audio adversarial examples in the literature. We first present an overview of the architecture of ASR systems and outline the basic attack philosophy. Followed by a brief introduction of the state-of-the-art solutions to audio adversarial examples, a comprehensive comparison is presented. Finally, after discussing existing countermeasures to defend ASR, we highlight several promising future research directions and challenges on constructing more robust and practical audio adversarial examples.",

   "abstract": "During rescue missions, transferring injured people from accident scenes to rescue sites is considered crucial and time-sensitive. In particular, a one-second delay could put more lives in danger. Though ambulances are commonly equipped with standard siren devices, such siren signals are not recognized by traffic light controllers. Therefore, rescue missions could be delayed at intersections due to an urgency-unaware traffic light control system. In the worst case, pile-up accidents could also happen when the ambulances lawfully ignores the traffic lights. This paper proposes A2T to enhance the efficiency of rescue missions, by establishing a communication mechanism among ambulances and infrastructures (e.g., traffic light controllers). Thailand, which had the highest road traffic death rate in the world in 2015, is selected as a use case in this paper. A2T promotes information sharing between ambulances and traffic light controllers along the rescue path in advance. Such information, including speeds, locations, and emergency routes, allows the traffic light controllers to launch a prioritized green traffic light accordingly. This allows the ambulances to go through any road intersection efficiently and safely. Our comprehensive performance evaluation shows that A2T achieves 100 percent waiting time reduction for the ambulances, with only 2.48 percent increase in delay of other vehicles at the intersections.",

   "abstract": "Traditional crowdsensing platforms rely on sensory information collected from a group of independent users or sensors. Recently, socially aware crowdsensing services have been introduced as the integration of social networks and crowdsensing platforms. For example, in health-related crowdsensing applications, a user benefits from information regarding food, exercise, medicine, and medical treatment collected and shared by his/her socially connected friends and family members. In this article, we first introduce basic concepts of socially aware crowdsensing services and highlight the importance of \"social network effects\" in the services. Typically adopted in social networks, network effects are used to quantify the influence of an action or preference of one user on other users with social ties. With this focus, we then discuss important aspects of socially aware crowdsensing services with network effects and some technical challenges. We find that game theory is a suitable analytical tool to investigate such crowdsensing services, for which important related work is surveyed. To address existing research gaps, we propose a game model for an incentive mechanism design with incomplete information about social network effects in socially aware crowdsensing. The proposed model is shown to improve the benefits of the crowdsensing service provider as well as those of the users.",

   "abstract": "In smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT) consists of many low-power smart nodes. Its robustness is essential for protection of communication in data science against node failures caused by energy shortage or cyber-attacks. Scale-free networking topology, widely applied in IoT, is effectively resilient to random attacks but is vulnerable to malicious ones in which high-degree nodes are made to fail. The prohibitively high computational cost of existing robustness optimization algorithms is an obstacle to efficient topology self-optimization. To solve this problem, a novel robust networking model based on artificial intelligence is proposed to improve IoT topology robustness to protect its communication. Using the Back-Propagation neural network learning algorithm, the model extracts topology features from a dataset by supervised training. The experimental results show that the model achieves better prediction accuracy, thereby optimizing the topology with minimal computation overhead.",

   "abstract": "After more than one decade of research efforts, ICN technologies seem mature enough to move from a design and implementation phase to early deployment trials. However, if one wants an ICN stack to be operated in a production context, some major locks, related to the lack of adequate deployment infrastructure, the migration of relevant services, and the capability to accurately monitor an overall ICN domain, must be addressed. In this article we present a feedback experience of the deployment of a Named Data Networking island. The latter considers HTTP over NDN as a primary service deployed through dedicated gateways and NFV as a substrate for deploying and orchestrating ICN components. From the performance assessment of individual components up to the opening of the testbed to end users in a university campus, we propose an analysis that can guide further research efforts in the ICN area.",

   "abstract": "In modern implantable medical devices (IMDs), wireless data transmission between inside and outside of the body is essential to control IMD parameters and report the acquired data to the external part of the system. Unlike conventional far-field data communication, which is more suitable for free space, near-field data transfer techniques have been widely adopted for transcutaneous data links in IMDs. These data links should be designed for robustness against misalignments and interference, while maintaining high power efficiency, sufficient bandwidth, and communication range in either uplink (IMD to outside) and/or downlink (wearable external part to IMD). In this article, we review fundamental principles and practical considerations for designing short-range transcutaneous data telemetry, along with novel techniques presented in the literature, which are categorized in uplink/downlink, passive/active, single/multi-carrier, and carrier-less pulse-based data telemetry methods.",

   "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have been extensively studied for nearly two decades as one of the most promising candidates expected to power the high-bandwidth, high-coverage wireless networks of the future. However, consumer demand for such networks has only recently caught up, rendering efforts at optimizing WMNs to support high capacities and offer high QoS, while being secure and fault-tolerant, more important than ever. To this end, a recent trend has been the application of machine learning (ML) to solve various design and management tasks related to WMNs. In this work, key ML techniques are discussed and past efforts applying them in WMNs are analyzed, while noting some existing issues and suggesting potential solutions. Directions are provided on how ML could advance future research. Recent developments in the field are also examined.",

   "abstract": "The UAV swarm is one of the most important developing trends in modern military operations. It is anticipated that in the near future, modern countries will embrace the use of UAV swarms across nearly every operating environment. The overall structure of a swarm, which is open, self-organizing, self-forming, and power saving friendly, makes it suitable for the battlefield, and it urgently needs to be defined. This article proposes an SDN and MQTT hybrid structure for battlefield UAV swarms, which is flexible, adaptable, intelligent, and controllable for topology, bandwidth, and payloads. The structure can adapt to the frequent change of swarm formation, support flexible data transmission among payloads, and improve swarm security in the battlefield. Furthermore, we propose a QoS-based multi-path routing framework, which calculates multiple disjointed paths from sources to destinations in order to enhance network performance. Case studies are listed and analyzed to validate the structure.",

   "abstract": "The current Internet is an end-to-end communication architecture based on packet switching between terminals. However, with the development of computer networks and increasing proliferation of communication services, the ability of this architecture-based Internet to transmit and process data has encountered challenges, and it has been unable to adapt to the rapid development of today's application requirements. Thus, information-centric networking (ICN) is emerging as a feasible solution and has become a new hot topic for future research in network architecture. The ICN strips content from terminal locations and provides services such as storage and multi-party communication through the publish/ subscribe paradigm. Although the ICN brings new opportunities for network development, there are plenty of problems existing in the ICN that have not been settled. For example, the conflict between polymerizability and mobility in the naming scheme, scalability problems of the name routing, as well as the inefficiency of transmission control algorithms under the circumstance of rich interest are all worth discussing. However, utilizing the computational and analytical features of artificial intelligence (AI) can help the ICN break through the bottleneck of existing technology development. With regard to the issues above, this article introduces and investigates some related technologies of AI in the ICN, that is, naming mechanism, transmission control, and content distribution, and introduces and surveys problems in ICN research. Furthermore, the next development direction of ICN and issues that need to be studied are discussed in this work.",

   "abstract": "Energy efficiency is paramount for IoT. One of the culprits for energy consumption in a typical sensor or actuator -- core components of IoT -- is the radio. Thus, duty cycling (i.e., turning the radio off when it is not needed) becomes essential. While wireless communication standards commonly include provisions for duty cycling, they are usually based on synchronization, which may be expensive in terms of hardware, software, or control communication overhead. Asynchronous methods have been extensively studied in the context of wireless sensor networks and thus are valuable tools for green IoT deployments. In this article, we provide a review of existing methods, from seminal works to recent proposals. We categorize and compare them qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we discuss recent trends in the area and suggest topics for future research.",

   "abstract": "Railways are the safest and most energy-efficient means of land transportation. Unfortunately, they are less attractive than other transportation means due to the relatively high ticket prices and unreliable travel times. Both are a consequence of high running and maintenance costs and inefficient usage of the railway infrastructure. In this article, we introduce new railway applications that increase railway safety and track use. This will accordingly decrease running costs. For instance, automatic train coupling will enable trains to automatically couple when they use the same track section and to automatically separate when they are required to use different tracks. This will enhance energy efficiency, track use, and running costs while maintaining safety requirements. To enable such an application, we introduce an ultra-reliable and low-latency millimeter-wave wireless communication system, the SBDist system, which provides direct communication and ranging between trains. We show from measurement data and simulations that the SBDist system achieves round-trip latency values below 50 ms and that the packet error rate values are enhanced by using circularly polarized antennas and applying a novel redundancy scheme.",

   "abstract": "5G communication networks will be complex due to the emergence of an unprecedented huge number of new types of connected devices and services. Moreover, the on-demand creation of virtual network slices, each suitable for a different application, is posing challenges to the efficient management of network resources, while optimally satisfying the quality of service requirements in time-varying workloads and network conditions. This article, which is tutorial in nature, introduces 5G network slices (from the point of view of the non-wireless part of the network) and elaborates the necessity of automation of network functions related to the design, construction, deployment, operation, control, and management of network slices. It revisits machine learning techniques applicable to the automation of network functions. It then presents a machine-learning-based framework for the operation and control of network slices by continuously monitoring workload, performance, and resource utilization, and dynamically adjusting the resources allocated to network slices. Preliminary results of workload prediction accuracy obtained from the analysis of real-life data collected from a web server are also reported.",

Consent as conceived of in data protection regulation cannot express all of the dimensions of Internet-enabled relationships. Moreover, \u201cconsent\u201d is a poor descriptor for the type of relationship trust assessment people perform in these circumstances. What's needed is a method to enable true mutual agency between any two parties in an Internet-enabled relationship. We propose a right-to-use license for access permissions as a practical alternative to consent and contract as used today, and a taxonomy that classifies important types of permissions. We also examine new data sharing scenarios, including decentralized identity, that may support their use.",

   "abstract": "Over the last years, there has been a significant increase in the number of services in mobile networks. This trend has forced operators to change their network management processes to ensure adequate user QoE, instead of adequate QoS. As a result, customer experience management is now a critical task for mobile network operators, who demand tools for QoE monitoring on an individual user basis. With the latest advances in information technologies, the newest TMA solutions can leverage the huge amount of information available from network elements and interfaces in mobile networks. However, data processing algorithms in these tools are still to be defined. In this work, we review the shortcomings and challenges in the use of TMA applications in mobile networks, and how these can be empowered by big data analytics. For this purpose, a methodology to validate a generic big-data-driven TMA framework with user terminal agents in a real cellular network is outlined. A use case is presented to show the potential and limitations of these applications for monitoring end-user QoE in a live LTE network.",

   "abstract": "More and more industrial applications require high reliability while relying on low-power devices for their flexibility. Unfortunately, radio transmissions are prone to unreliability and are very sensitive to external interference. Therefore, a great amount of effort has been put into channel hopping approaches, which help to combat external interference by reducing the number of packet losses. This approach is combined with a strict schedule of transmissions to allow devices to save energy. However, some of the radio channels are subjected to strong interference. Blacklisting techniques identify the interfered radio channels that demonstrate low packet delivery ratio and avoid using them to transmit data packets. In this article, we study different distributed and global blacklisting techniques and investigate their dependencies on the scheduling algorithm. We also present a new scheme to exploit a blacklist by making the employed scheduling algorithm blacklist-aware. Our results rely on a real experimental dataset to quantify the performance of all these approaches and demonstrate the interest of blacklisting to improve network reliability.",

Specifically, we believe what is required is for a PKI to be deployed at a global scale. A PKI consists of a collection of digital certificates that cryptographically bind an individual's identity to their public key. In this article, we present an overview of our recent work in the areas of identity management and privacy, with specific emphasis on the deployment of a blockchain backed PKI. Once a PKI is in place, we are in a position to perform a number of common network tasks much more securely and efficiently than we can do currently.",

   "abstract": "Conventional schemes for service provisioning in next-generation elastic optical networks (EONs) rely on rule-based policies that suffer from scalability issues and can lead to poor resource utilization efficiency due to the lack of knowledge about the essential characteristics of EONs (e.g., traffic profiles, physical-layer impairments). This article discusses the application of emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in EONs for enabling an autonomic (self-driving) and cognitive networking framework. This new framework achieves self-learning-based service provisioning capabilities by employing DRL agents to learn policies from dynamic network operations. Such capabilities can remarkably reduce the amount of human effort invested in developing effective service provisioning policies for emerging applications, and thus, can facilitate fast network evolutions. Based on the framework, we first present DeepRMSA, a DRL-based routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment (RMSA) agent for EONs. Then, as today's networks are often composed of multiple autonomous systems, we extend the autonomic networking framework to multi-domain EONs by applying multi-agent DRL (where multiple autonomous DRL agents learn through jointly interacting with their environments). Comparisons of the results from numerical simulations show significant advantages of the proposed framework over the existing rule-based heuristic designs.",

   "abstract": "The telecommunications industry is demanding more technical and non-technical skills as well as increased creativity and flexibility from its next generation workforce. University education provides strong fundamental background, but can offer only limited hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology, development tools, and processes as part of the broader curriculum. Whereas gaining relevant experience is generally possible for theses, we propose a new educational methodology and tools that can be used in classes at any degree level. Specifically, we introduce a hands-on learning methodology that consists of collaborative and competitive modules and apply it for teaching modern wireless communications. It has seven learning stages that follow the principles of project-based learning. The evaluation requires special attention, and several mechanisms are discussed for evaluating students and the methodology. Enabled by software radio technology, we present a practical learning environment and open source software tools that facilitate developing many of the needed technical and soft skills and demonstrate the suitability of the proposed methodology as applied to the undergraduate Software Radio Engineering class at Barcelona Tech-UPC.",

It contains several volatile organic compounds and biological entities that can act as health biomarkers. For instance, the breath of an infected human contains a nonnegligible amount of pathogenic aerosol that can spread or remain suspended in the atmosphere. Therefore, the exhaled breath can be exploited as a source's message in a communication setup to remotely scan the bio-information via an aerosol transmission channel. An overview of the basic configuration is presented along with a description of system components with a particular emphasis on channel modeling. Furthermore, the challenges that arise in theoretical analysis and system development are highlighted. Finally, several open issues are discussed to concretize the proposed communication concept.",

   "abstract": "MEC is an emerging paradigm that utilizes computing resources at the network edge to deploy heterogeneous applications and services. In the MEC system, mobile users and enterprises can offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby computing resources to reduce latency and save energy. When users make offloading decisions, the task dependency needs to be considered. Due to the NP-hardness of the offloading problem, the existing solutions are mainly heuristic, and therefore have difficulties in adapting to the increasingly complex and dynamic applications. To address the challenges of task dependency and adapting to dynamic scenarios, we propose a new DRL-based offloading framework, which can efficiently learn the offloading policy uniquely represented by a specially designed S2S neural network. The proposed DRL solution can automatically discover the common patterns behind various applications so as to infer an optimal offloading policy in different scenarios. Simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL-based method with different data transmission rates and task numbers. The results show that our method outperforms two heuristic baselines and achieves nearly optimal performance.",

   "abstract": "Content-centric networking (CCN) offers a promising platform for efficient content dissemination through its name-based transport model exploiting in-network caching, multipath forwarding, and multicast delivery. Unlike IP transport, which is separated from applications, the receiver- driven transport in CCN allows applications to flexibly determine the transport functionalities they prefer. To achieve high throughput and minimize latency, a couple of transport control methods using various types of request messages have recently been proposed, but it is still unclear how they can support massive applications in terms of both the application requirements and network performance. In this article, we investigate the effectiveness of three types of requests: \"pipeline,\" \"symbolic interest,\" and \"any next packet,\" when they are used as the transport control scheme in a CCN network. We carry out several performance evaluations regarding the latency, bandwidth overhead, and forwarding state reductions, and identify the characteristics and best use cases of each type of request as well as the potential challenges.",

   "abstract": "5G promises many new vertical service areas beyond simple communication and data transfer. We propose cooperative passive coherent location (CPCL), a distributed MIMO radar service, which can be offered by mobile radio network operators as a service for public user groups. CPCL comes as an inherent part of the radio network and takes advantage of the most important key features proposed for 5G. It extends the well-known idea of passive radar (also known as passive coherent location, PCL) by introducing cooperative principles. These range from cooperative, synchronous radio signaling and MAC up to radar data fusion on the sensor and scenario levels. By using software-defined radio and network paradigms, as well as real-time mobile edge computing facilities intended for 5G, CPCL promises to become a ubiquitous radar service that may be adaptive, reconfigurable, and perhaps cognitive. As CPCL makes double use of radio resources (in terms of both frequency bands and hardware), it can be considered a green technology. Although we introduce the CPCL idea from the viewpoint of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure communication, it can definitely also be applied to many other applications in industry, transport, logistics, and for safety and security applications.",

   "abstract": "To meet the demands of mobile networks toward 2020, 5G has emerged. Compared to 4G, the 5G network will be deployed in higher-frequency bands, such as 3.5 GHz. Meanwhile, in order to save costs, operators expect to deploy the 5G network by reusing the legacy sites of 4G networks. Note that the coverage of base stations decreases with the increase of carrier frequency, and coverage enhancement techniques are required in 5G to cope with the coverage loss. In this article, coverage enhancement techniques are first analyzed. A field trial adopting pre-commercial 5G systems is then set up to assess the coverage performance. The analysis along with the promising field trial results indicate that the coverage of the 3.5 GHz frequency band can be guaranteed in the 5G network deployed with 4G legacy sites.",

At the same time, crowd management systems can benefit city planning, emergency control, and mobile network design. In this work, we exploit urban data as a way of analyzing crowd behavior. We analyze the types of crowd situations, describe the major types of urban data, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We then discuss the key research challenges and opportunities in the analysis of urban environments. Moreover, through case studies, we explain how to apply urban data for spatial, temporal, and semantic observations of crowd situations.",

These initiatives are designed to cooperate safer, efficient, eco-friendly, and enjoyable transportation for people and goods in large urban areas. However, current research on smart transportation systems has neglected a fundamental building block: smart crowd management. In a smart transportation system, the smart crowd management component will be demanded for identifying and controlling the congestion that can occur during commutes and routine travel. In this article, we discuss the incompleteness of current smart transportation system initiatives as they are not implementing a smart crowd management component. Moreover, we identify and discuss the basic steps for the design of solutions for smart crowd management, as well as the main challenges that must be addressed. Finally, we provide future research directions for the design of smart crowd management solutions and infrastructures for smart transportation systems.",

In this article, we focus on how enabling lower-layer flexibility in the RAN affects the development of RAN slicing, particularly in relation to ensuring isolation between RAN slices. We first examine how RAN slices may be individually tailored for different services. We follow this up with an examination of the potential time-frequency resource structure of the RAN, focusing on the trade-off between flexibility and the overhead related to ensuring coexistence between contrasting RAN slices. Based on this analysis, we suggest an approach that permits the allocation of resources to a service-type to be performed separately to resource allocation for individual services belonging to that type.",

In this work, we first present the main types of D2D applications, then we discuss the characteristics of task offloading and the quality of experience in D2D ecosystems. After that, we list five popular questions regarding the ability of other users to be helpful in terms of resources, connectivity, availability, incentives, and security. To answer the listed questions, we use two mobile big data datasets, one experimental study, and arguments from our experience and the literature.",

   "abstract": "The fifth generation wireless service of sensor networks involves significant challenges when dealing with the coordination of the ever-increasing number of devices accessing shared resources. This has drawn major interest from the research community as many existing works focus on the radio access network congestion control to efficiently manage resources in the context of device-to-device (D2D) interaction in huge sensor networks. In this context, this article pioneers a study on the impact of D2D link reliability in group-assisted random access protocols by shedding light on beneficial performance and potential limitations of approaches of this kind against tunable parameters such as group size, number of sensors, and reliability of D2D links. Additionally, we leverage the association with a geolocation database (GDB) capability to assist the grouping decisions by drawing parallels with recent regulatory-driven initiatives around GDBs and arguing the benefits of the suggested proposal. Finally, the proposed method is proved to significantly reduce the delay over random access channels by means of an exhaustive simulation campaign.",

It plays a vital role in daily applications and is also subtly changing the rules, habits, and behaviors of society. However, inevitably, data-based learning strategies are bound to cause potential security and privacy threats, and arouse public as well as government concerns about its promotion to the real world. In this article, we mainly focus on data security issues in deep learning. We first investigate the potential threats of deep learning in this area, and then present the latest countermeasures based on various underlying technologies, where the challenges and research opportunities on offense and defense are also discussed. Then, we propose SecureNet, the first verifiable and privacy-preserving prediction protocol to protect model integrity and user privacy in DNNs. It can significantly resist various security and privacy threats during the prediction process. We simulate SecureNet under a real dataset, and the experimental results show the superior performance of SecureNet for detecting various integrity attacks against DNN models.",

   "abstract": "Densely crowded environments such as stadiums and metro stations have shown shortcomings when users request data and services simultaneously. This is due to the excessive amount of requested and generated traffic from the user side. Based on the wide availability of user smart-mobile devices, and noting their technological advancements, devices are not being categorized only as data/service requesters anymore, but are readily being transformed to data/ service providing network-side tools. In essence, to offload some of the workload burden from the cloud, data can be either fully or partially replicated to edge and mobile devices for faster and more efficient data access in such dense environments. Moreover, densely crowded environments provide an opportunity to deliver, in a timely manner, through node collaboration, enriched user-specific services using the replicated data and device-specific capabilities. In this article, we first highlight the challenges that arise in densely crowded environments in terms of data/service management and delivery. Then we show how data replication and service composition are considered promising solutions for data and service management in densely crowded environments. Specifically, we describe how to replicate data from the cloud to the edge, and then to mobile devices to provide faster data access for users. We also discuss how services can be composed in crowded environments using service-specific overlays. We conclude the article with most of the open research areas that remain to be investigated.",

   "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is a key technology of fifth generation wireless systems to achieve the expected 1000x data rate. With large bandwidth at the mmWave band, the link capacity between users and base stations (BSs) can be much higher compared to sub-6 GHz wireless systems. Meanwhile, due to the high cost of infrastructure upgrade, it would be difficult for operators to drastically enhance the capacity of backhaul links between mmWave BSs and the core network. As a result, the data rate provided by backhaul may not be sufficient to support all mmWave links; hence, the backhaul connection becomes the new bottleneck. On the other hand, as mmWave channels are subject to random blockage, the data rates of mmWave users significantly vary over time. With limited backhaul capacity and highly dynamic data rates of users, how to allocate backhaul resource to each user remains a challenge for mmWave systems. In this article, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address this challenge. By learning the blockage pattern, the system dynamics can be captured and predicted, resulting in efficient utilization of backhaul resource. We begin with a discussion on DRL and its application in wireless systems. We then investigate the problem of backhaul resource allocation and present the DRL-based solution. Finally, we discuss open problems for future research and conclude this article.",

   "abstract": "Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a promising technology for future wireless communications due to its potential for cost-effective network deployment and high data rate. There are several implementation issues in OWC that have not been encountered in radio frequency wireless communications. First, practical OWC transmitters need illumination control on color, intensity, luminance, and so on, which poses complicated modulation design challenges. Furthermore, signal-dependent properties of optical channels raise nontrivial challenges in both modulation and demodulation of the optical signals. To tackle such difficulties, deep learning (DL) technologies can be applied for optical wireless transceiver design. This article addresses recent efforts on DL-based OWC system designs. A DL framework for emerging image sensor communication is proposed, and its feasibility is verified by simulation. Finally, technical challenges and implementation issues for the DL-based optical wireless technology are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Traffic classification has been studied for two decades and applied to a wide range of applications from QoS provisioning and billing in ISPs to security-related applications in firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Port-based, data packet inspection, and classical machine learning methods have been used extensively in the past, but their accuracy has declined due to the dramatic changes in Internet traffic, particularly the increase in encrypted traffic. With the proliferation of deep learning methods, researchers have recently investigated these methods for traffic classification and reported high accuracy. In this article, we introduce a general framework for deep-learning-based traffic classification. We present commonly used deep learning methods and their application in traffic classification tasks. Then we discuss open problems, challenges, and opportunities for traffic classification.",

   "abstract": "Time series prediction can be generalized as a process that extracts useful information from historical records and then determines future values. Learning long-range dependencies that are embedded in time series is often an obstacle for most algorithms, whereas LSTM solutions, as a specific kind of scheme in deep learning, promise to effectively overcome the problem. In this article, we first give a brief introduction to the structure and forward propagation mechanism of LSTM. Then, aiming at reducing the considerable computing cost of LSTM, we put forward a RCLSTM model by introducing stochastic connectivity to conventional LSTM neurons. Therefore, RCLSTM exhibits a certain level of sparsity and leads to a decrease in computational complexity. In the field of telecommunication networks, the prediction of traffic and user mobility could directly benefit from this improvement as we leverage a realistic dataset to show that for RCLSTM, the prediction performance comparable to LSTM is available, whereas considerably less computing time is required. We strongly argue that RCLSTM is more competent than LSTM in latency-stringent or power-constrained application scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Delivering reliable and high-capacity Internet connectivity to high-speed train users is a challenge. Modern railway cars act as Faraday cages, and a typical train comprises several hundreds of users moving at high velocity. Furthermore, with the global availability of 4G LTE, user expectations have dramatically increased: it is expected to be online anytime and anywhere. Demand for high-capacity mobile is being driven by video and music streaming services, for lower latency and higher availability by gaming, and for more reliability and even uplink capacity by mission-critical applications. Finally, the life cycle of the railway industry is much longer than for telecommunications, which makes supporting 5G challenging. In this article, we survey the challenges associated with delivering high-capacity connectivity to train users, describe potential options, and highlight how a leading western European operator is tackling these challenges and preparing for 5G and beyond.",

Conventional cloud and edge computing paradigms may thus become insufficient in supporting the increasingly stringent operating requirements of intelligent IoT devices that can move unpredictably and at high speeds. Complementing these, the concept of fog emerges to deploy cooperative cloud-like functions in the immediate vicinity of various moving devices, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, on the road and in the air. Envisioning the gradual evolution of these infrastructures toward an increasingly denser geographical distribution of fog functionality, we in this work put forward the vision of dense moving fog for intelligent IoT applications. To this aim, we review the recent powerful enablers, outline the main challenges and opportunities, and corroborate the performance benefits of collaborative dense fog operation in a characteristic use case featuring a connected fleet of autonomous vehicles.",

   "abstract": "Management and orchestration of virtual resources and functions, commonly referred to as MANO, are key functionalities of NFV environments. This article describes the design and deployment of the NFV MANO platform of 5TONIC, the open research and innovation laboratory on 5G technologies founded by Telefonica and IMDEA Networks. This NFV MANO platform provides 5TONIC trials and experiments with access to a functional production-like NFV environment, enabling experimentation with novel NFV products and services. As a relevant feature, the platform is capable of incorporating external sites to complement the portfolio of software and hardware resources that can be made available for experimentation activities. The 5TONIC MANO platform has been designed and built using open source technologies. The research carried out during its design and deployment has resulted in a contribution already made to its upstream projects regarding the automated configuration of virtualized network functions. Finally, we explore the scalability properties of the 5TONIC MANO platform, and we experimentally validate its functional capacity to orchestrate multi-site experiments.",

   "abstract": "CoMP transmission and reception have been considered in cellular networks for enabling larger coverage, improved rates, and interference mitigation. To harness the gains of coordinated beamforming, fast information exchange over a backhaul connecting the cooperating BSs is required. In practice, the bandwidth and delay limitations of the backhaul may not be able to meet such stringent demands. These impairments motivate the study of cooperative approaches based only on local CSI that require minimal or no information exchange between the BSs. To this end, several distributed approaches are introduced for CB-CoMP. The proposed methods rely on the channel reciprocity and iterative spatially precoded over-the-air pilot signaling. We elaborate how F-B training facilitates distributed CB by allowing BSs and UEs to iteratively optimize their respective transmitters/receivers based on only locally measured CSI. The trade-off due to the overhead from the F-B iterations is discussed. We also consider the challenge of dynamic TDD where the UE-UE channel knowledge cannot be acquired at the BSs by exploiting channel reciprocity. Finally, standardization activities and practical requirements for enabling the proposed F-B training schemes in 5G radio access are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The first generation of IoT was developed and deployed all over the world by connecting devices with common functionalities that were not sufficiently efficient or reliable for use in dynamic situations that require adaptive solutions. However, these fundamental IoT functions and services mainly targeted stable environments; there is consequently a strong need for the next generation of IoT services to be smarter, faster, and more reliable. We believe that the hyper-connected IoT ecosystem on fog platforms with contextual AI technologies is a promising solution. In this work, we introduce the EiF, a flexible fog computing framework that runs on IoT gateways with adaptive AI services fostered on the cloud. Our approach can be viewed as an integration of three emerging technologies, namely IoT, fog, and AI. Generally, EiF virtualizes an IoT service layer platform for fog nodes, and provides functions to manage and orchestrate various fog nodes; upon service virtualization and orchestration, AI services are fostered within both the federated cloud and distributed edge side and are deployed on fog nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of EiF via the example of intelligent traffic flow monitoring and management.",

   "abstract": "Emotion is a complex mental state that guides people's thoughts and behaviors. The ability to recognize one's own emotions and to understand others' emotions helps people manage their personal lives and social relations more successfully. Meanwhile, mobile and wearable devices have become indispensable tools for most of the population. They provide great opportunities for building emotional intelligent applications. In this article, we introduce how mobile and wearable devices work as \u201cemotion sensors\u201d by leveraging their sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, which help monitor people's mental health, facilitate social interactions, and improve user experience. We first describe a general emotion sensing framework that consists of sensing, inferring, and responding steps. After reviewing the state-of-the-art systems on this topic, we summarize and discuss various sensing modalities enabled by mobile and wearable devices. We then describe the widely used inferring procedures and methods. Additionally, we present three solutions of facial expression recognition on smartphones as a case of emotion inference. Finally, we introduce emerging emotion sensing applications, and discuss challenges and opportunities.",

   "abstract": "Current operational scenarios are raising new challenges for the deployment of armed forces. New command and control (C2) approaches are emerging to address these problems, pushing responsibility to the edge of the battlefield in what is called network-centric C2 operations. Advances in network warfare have also led to the development of the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT), which combines everything on the battlefield that can support informed decision making. However, these new dynamics require new network paradigms that can be adapted to efficient network operations. In view of the lack of technical solutions, this work seeks to merge information-centric networking (ICN) with software-defined networking (SDN) to meet the high-level operational requirements for \"C2 agility\" within deployed networks. ICN provides a more efficient data distribution within \"ICN islands\" in the military IP network, while SDN enables ICN to be integrated with the rest of the IP network, as well as control the patterns of interaction among the IoBT heterogeneous nodes, thus enhancing ICN features. After reviewing key concepts in C2, IoBT, SDN, and ICN, the architecture was modeled in a specific application, and the first experiments have shown promising results.",

This article describes how to move forward from these initial steps, identifies the challenges network service developers face during both development and runtime, and explains how to overcome them with our SCK and programmable MANO framework. We detail how our SCK facilitates the service creation process, resulting in two enhanced NFV DevOps cycles, test flexibility and quicker service development. We elaborate on our programmable MANO framework with both architectural considerations and a use case, to depict its customizability by network service developers, giving them fine-grained control over their service throughout its end-to-end operational life cycle.",

   "abstract": "While the IoT has made significant progress along the lines of supporting its individual applications, there are many MMTC scenarios in which the performance offered by any single RAT available today might be insufficient. To address these use cases, we introduce the concept of MR-MMTC, which implies the availability and utilization of several RATs within a single IoT device. We begin by offering insights into which use cases could be beneficial and what the key challenges for MR-MMTC implementation are. We continue by discussing the potential technical solutions and employing our own prototype of an MR-MMTC device capable of using LoRaWAN and NB-IoT RATs to characterize its energy-centric performance across the alternative feasible MR-MMTC implementation strategies. The obtained results reveal that an increased flexibility delivered by MR-MMTC permits the selection of more energy-efficient RAT options. The IoT devices capable of utilizing multiple radios simultaneously can thus improve their energy utilization by leveraging the synergy between RATs. The novel vision of MR-MMTC outlined in this work could be impactful across multiple fields, and calls for cross-community research efforts in order to adequately design, implement, and deploy future multi-RAT MMTC solutions.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a low-cost laboratory that has been designed and developed to enhance learning experience and help students gain skills and knowledge in the field of distributed systems. In order to build a comprehensive distributed file system, we used the laboratory consisting of 40 card-sized Raspberry Pi devices, with the accent on stability, scalability, and low cost. Aiming to assess the impact of this new learning environment on the learning process and its outcomes, we surveyed students following the completion of three project stages during the 17 laboratory exercises in one academic year, ensuring that we maintained the same subjects of study during the experiments. Supported by interesting answers on various sets of questions, we provide a valuable insight into students' experience, obstacles and observations during system's implementation. This particular insight paves the way toward further laboratory improvement, adopting this approach in other courses related to ours, and encouraging teachers to embrace similar practice regardless of the field of education.",

   "abstract": "We examine dynamic optical service restoration on a large-scale ROADM network operated by China Telecom in the middle and lower Yangtze River region of China. A WSON-based GMPLS/ ASON control plane, deployed across the network, drives execution of restoration operations. A network survivability analysis (NSA) tool is used for simulation-based assessment of link failure impacts and expected service restoration performance. Evolutions in wavelength utilization, when operating dynamic restoration on a large set of services and over a range of concurrent fiber cut numbers and placements across the network, are examined in detail through NSA-based analysis. The results are partly verified through live network experiments conducted during network commissioning operations. Observations of other restoration performance aspects, such as service times to restore, are also discussed. We show that with dynamic restoration, full service restorability can remain achievable even in the face of four or more concurrent fiber cuts. We describe how findings from NSA-based analyses may be used to influence network planning or to partially prescribe control plane restoration actions to improve service times to restore, and reduce restoration conflicts and failures. We posit that the best such improvements may be available when NSA is operated in concert with centralized path computation applications (e.g., PCE and T-SDN controllers).",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem is gaining momentum in urban environments where several devices, originally deployed for a specific purpose and belonging to different technologies, are now linked together to harmonize heterogeneous and holistic scenarios. Early deployments have proven their value, but novel use cases such as automotive, public safety, and e-health are being considered in the context of smart cities. Such use cases demand new and stringent requirements that cannot be supported by current solutions in terms of both latency and computing power. In order to meet these requirements in a cost-efficient manner, the multi-access edge computing (MEC) paradigm is considered here as currently being defined by the ETSI MEC Industry Specification Group. In this article, we propose an ETSI-compliant MEC architectural solution that allows seamlessly integrating existing and future IoT platforms. In addition, an IoT gateway middleware is presented as a novel component that enables running low-latency and computationally intensive applications on generalized MEC-based systems.",

   "abstract": "Convenience often trumps concerns about security in our everyday use of Internet of Things products. Cybersecurity professionals are usually expected to anticipate and eliminate these concerns as part of product development. We believe that they can join forces with user-centered designers, who are tasked to go beyond simple usability and communicate to users how to make their interactions secure. We developed a course in secure design that teaches students in cybersecurity and user-centered design to integrate usable security and information design in order to better communicate threats and emphasize key decisions to the user. As this is the first course of its kind, we conducted a study to assess students' interest and self-efficacy in the new field of secure design. This article reports the findings of this study and discusses the implications of user-centered security training of the future cybersecurity workforce.",

   "abstract": "Future vehicles will have rich computing resources to support autonomous driving and be connected by wireless technologies. Vehicular fog networks (VeFNs) have thus emerged to enable computing resource sharing via computation task offloading, providing a wide range of fog applications. However, the high mobility of vehicles makes it hard to guarantee the delay that accounts for both communication and computation throughout the whole task offloading procedure. In this article, we first review the state of the art of task offloading in VeFNs, and argue that mobility is not only an obstacle for timely computing in VeFNs, but can also benefit the delay performance. We then identify machine learning and coded computing as key enabling technologies to address and exploit mobility in VeFNs. Case studies are provided to illustrate how to adapt learning algorithms to suit the dynamic environment in VeFNs, and how to exploit the mobility with opportunistic computation offloading and task replication.",

   "abstract": "Knowledge of information about the propagation channel in which a wireless system operates enables better, more efficient approaches for signal transmissions. Therefore, channel state information (CSI) plays a pivotal role in the system performance. The importance of CSI is in fact growing in the upcoming 5G and beyond systems, for example, for the implementation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). However, the acquisition of timely and accurate CSI has long been considered a major issue, and becomes increasingly challenging due to the need for obtaining CSI of many antenna elements in massive MIMO systems. To cope with this challenge, existing works mainly focus on exploiting linear structures of CSI, such as CSI correlations in the spatial domain, to achieve dimensionality reduction. In this article, we first systematically review the state of the art on CSI structure exploitation. We then extend to seek deeper structures that enable remote CSI inference wherein a data-driven deep neural network (DNN) approach is necessary due to model inadequacy. We develop specific DNN designs suitable for CSI data. Case studies are provided to demonstrate great potential in this direction for future performance enhancement.",

   "abstract": "The emergence of NFV has drawn the attention of academia, standardization bodies, and industry, because of the possibility of reducing capital and operational costs while introducing innovation in computer networks. To enable developers to independently publish and distribute VNFs, marketplaces akin to online application stores are essential. Research efforts in several aspects are necessary to enable wider adoption of such online application stores in emerging NFVbased computer networks. This article reviews the historical perspective of networking paradigms and technologies to propose FENDE, a marketplace and ecosystem for the distribution and execution of VNFs and composition of service function chains. Major challenges that must be overcome to promote the adoption of marketplaces in emerging NFV-based networks are investigated and discussed.",

   "abstract": "In cellular communication systems, user discovery or initial access (IA) procedures enable a terminal entering a cell to connect to the base station (BS). Up to 4G systems, users broadcast a cell-connect request omnidirectionally, and the BS replies to the request. In 5G systems operating at mmWave, directional transmissions (by means of beamforming) are needed to overcome strong attenuations. However, during IA the user's and BS's reciprocal positions are not known, and therefore a search procedure explores different directions, substantially increasing the IA overhead. Still, directions of arrival statistics largely depend on buildings and typical user entrance paths, which characterize the cell. By exploiting these statistics IA can be significantly accelerated, by searching more often where users typically are. In order to acquire the statistics, an online method is proposed and its performance is assessed for the first time using real data from a traffic data survey. We observe that the online method reduces the average discovery time up to 25 percent with respect to the conventional approach that does not exploit the user statistics.",

   "abstract": "The notion of a fast uplink grant is emerging as a promising solution for enabling massive machine type communication (MTC) in the Internet of Things over cellular networks. By using the fast uplink grant, machine type devices (MTDs) will no longer require RA channels to send scheduling requests. Instead, uplink resources can be actively allocated to MTDs by a base station. In this article, the challenges and opportunities for adopting the fast uplink grant to support MTCs are investigated. First, the fundamentals of fast uplink grant and its advantages over conventional scheduled and uncoordinated access schemes are presented. Then, the key challenges that include the prediction of the set of MTDs with data to transmit, as well as the optimal scheduling of MTDs, are exposed. To overcome these challenges, a two-stage approach that includes traffic prediction and optimized scheduling is proposed. In particular, various solutions for source traffic prediction for periodic MTC traffic are reviewed and novel methods for event-driven traffic prediction are proposed. For optimal allocation of uplink grants, advanced machine learning techniques are presented. By using the proposed solutions, the fast uplink grant has the potential to enable cellular networks to support massive MTCs and effectively reduce the signaling overhead and overcome the delay and congestion challenges of conventional RA schemes.",

   "abstract": "The digital identity problem is a complex one in large part because it involves personal data, the algorithms which compute insights on the data, and the management of the identifiers that are linked to personal data. The reality of today is that personal data of an individual is distributed throughout the Internet, in both private and public institutions, and increasingly also on the user's devices. In order to empower individuals to have a say in who has access to their personal data and to enable individuals to make use of their data for their own purposes, a coherent and scalable federated authorization architecture is required as a fundamental component of the decentralized identity solution. This federation must allow an individual to easily manage access policies, and to grant and retract consent for access to data distributed across multiple repositories. This article describes the User Managed Access architecture and protocols that provide the foundation for scalable federated authorization.",

   "abstract": "Emerging applications such as machine learning place higher demands on the flexibility and scalability of data center networks. On one hand, it is difficult for the fixed network topology to match the traffic patterns of different neural networks. On the other hand, the rapid growth of training data, model size, and computing requirements has led to an ever-increasing scale of data center networks. Traditional electrical interconnects lack the ability to adjust the network topology and communication bandwidth, resulting in significant resource waste and high expansion costs. Optical interconnects are introduced to solve the above problems because of its high bandwidth, low power consumption, and reconfigurability. In this article, the optical interconnects in recent years are analyzed in detail, and the flexibility and scalability of different networks are compared qualitatively. The future trends and challenges of optical interconnects in data centers are discussed from the aspects of optical transmission technology, optical switching technology, and optical network control and management.",

   "abstract": "The convergence of communication and computing (COM2P) has been taken as a promising solution for the sustainable development of mobile communication systems. The introduction of fog computing in future mobile networks makes COM2P possible. This article provides an overview on fog computing enabled mobile communication networks (FogMNW), including network architecture, system capacity and resource management. First, this article analyzes the heterogeneity of FogMNW with both advanced communication techniques and fog computing. Then a heterogeneous communication and hierarchical fog computing network architecture is proposed. With both communication and computing resources, FogMNW is enabled to achieve much higher capacity than conventional communication networks. This has been well demonstrated by the coded multicast scheme. Furthermore, a systematic management of communication and computing resources is necessary for FogMNW. By exploiting the communication load diversity in N cells, a communication load aware CLA scheme can achieve much higher computing resource efficiency than comparing schemes. The performance gap increases with N, and CLA can improve efficiency by more than 100 percent when there are 14 cells.",

   "abstract": "Information-centric networking (ICN) is an important trend that will impact the future of the Internet. ICN caters to large content consumption patterns while achieving high performance. New features in the information-centric future Internet, such as caching, name-based routing, and content-based security, bring novel challenges to a decentralized environment. On one hand, the processing capabilities on the edge in an information-centric future Internet need to implement smart analysis for large quantities of content. On the other hand, the computational and storage resources need to be configured and controlled on demand and based on cognition of the content from users. To address these challenges, this article proposes a fog-computing- enabled cognitive network functions virtualization approach for an information-centric future Internet. We first propose an on-demand caching function virtualization scheme and design a communication scheme between the fog nodes and the future Internet nodes for the forwarding process. Then, to attain smart control for related operations (i.e., routing, cache policy, and security), we propose a control function virtualization approach. Finally, a cognitive resource configuration mechanism is proposed. The simulation results show the advantages and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

   "abstract": "The rise of smart health promotes ubiquitous healthcare services with the adoption of information and communication technologies. However, increasing demands of medical services require more computing and storage resources in proximity of medical users for intelligent sensing, processing, and analysis. Fog computing emerges to enable in situ data processing and service provision for smart health in proximity of medical users, exploiting a large number of small-scale servers. In this article, we investigate fog-enabled smart health toward cooperative and secure healthcare service provision. Specifically, we first introduce the overall infrastructure and some promising applications, including emergent healthcare service, health risk assessment, and healthcare notification. We then discuss the challenges of fog-enabled smart health from the perspectives of cooperation and security. A case study is presented to demonstrate efficient and secure health data sharing through Naive Bayes classification and attribute-based encryption with assistance from fog computing. Finally, by exploring interesting future directions, more attention can be attracted to this emerging area.",

However, there are a number of technical and implementation challenges in both the MAC and PHY layers of FDX DOCSIS that must be overcome in order for the standard to live up to its potential as a major enabler of next-generation services. Due to the relatively small and insular nature of the DOCSIS community, these challenges may not attract attention in the academic community commensurate with their importance.

We study the application of full-duplex NOMA transmission in wireless cellular, relay and cognitive radio networks, and demonstrate achievable performance gains. It is shown that the effects of self-interference and inter-user interference due to full-duplex operation can be effectively mitigated by optimizing/enhancing the beamforming, power control, and link scheduling techniques. We also discuss research challenges and future directions so that full-duplex NOMA can be made practical in the near future.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel network that transforms our future by interconnecting everything. With the rapid deployment of IoT devices and applications, a large amount of data is introduced into the network. Hence, we may suffer spectrum scarcity issue due to the massive data. Cognitive radio (CR) is a potential solution for addressing this issue, which can improve spectrum efficiency by dynamic spectrum access. The IoT device with CR capability has become a new research interest. In this article, we propose a full-duplex-based control channel establishment (FDCCE) scheme for cognitive IoT (CIoT). In the FDCCE scheme, CR-based IoT devices (CRDs) can establish control channels on both licensed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum without a central entity. By combining the licensed spectrum and the unlicensed spectrum, the control channel between CRDs can be established successfully even though there is no common available licensed channel between them. Moreover, CRDs with FD radios can sense and transmit data on the same channel simultaneously. Hence, the interference with licensed primary users can be effectively avoided while the time for dedicated spectrum sensing can be saved. Rendezvous on the same channel is the necessary process for the control channel establishment between CRDs. Performance analysis demonstrates the upper bound of the maximum time to rendezvous, channel loading, and degree of rendezvous for the FDCCE scheme. Simulation results show the superiority of the FDCCE scheme in terms of time to rendezvous.",

   "abstract": "Consumer demand for high definition video is growing, but current Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks lack sufficient capacity to broadcast the typical 10 to 20 TV channels concurrently broadcast in a geographic region. In response to growing demand, the Third Generation Partnership Program initiated a study into TV enhancements for multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) for LTE. 3GPP's further enhanced MBMS (FeMBMS) enables higher per cell bandwidth for MBMS services, simultaneous reception of both unicast and multicast services from different mobile network operators (MNOs), MBMS-dedicated cells, standalone MBMS, non-subscriber reception of TV services, and larger cell sizes. In addition, shared enhanced MBMS (eMBMS) networks and MBMS transport services enable MNOs to minimize costs from the content providers, while at the same time incentivizing the content providers to exploit LTE for linear TV services. Finally, by utilizing MBMS on demand (MooD) and dynamic MBMS, the resource allocations to the MBMS flows can be dynamically adapted; for example, the users' quality of experience can be further improved beyond that of legacy static MBMS resource allocation. This article describes the enhancements made to LTE eMBMS related to TV services, MooD, and use cases for each of the enhancements. Additionally, MBMS in 5G next-generation radio is also discussed. The scope of this article comprises the terminal, radio access, core architecture, and related services.",

   "abstract": "Wireless network virtualization is regarded as a technology to enable sharing of physical wireless infrastructure and RF slices for improving not only wireless network capacity and coverage but also wireless security. This article provides a perspective of fusion of three emerging technologies: SDN, EC, and blockchain technology for wireless network virtualization. SDN, with the help of controllers, allows dynamic configuration of network resources for their efficient management. EC not only helps to process user signals and queries at respective base stations with the shortest possible delay, but also helps to avoid the need of a high-speed backhaul link between a base station and centralized controllers. Blockchain technology protects owners of wireless infrastructures from a double spending attack that allocates the same wireless resource (RF slice) to multiple virtual wireless networks. The proposed approach aims to reduce business friction and increase the trust and transparency in the wireless networking industry.",

   "abstract": "For the past 40 years, the cellular industry has been relying on static radio access deployments with gross over-provisioning. However, to meet the exponentially growing volumes of irregular data, the very notion of a cell will have to be rethought to allow them be (re-)configured on-demand and in an automated manner. This work puts forward a vision of moving networks to match dynamic user demand with network access supply in beyond-5G cellular systems. The resulting adaptive and flexible network infrastructures will leverage intelligent capable devices (e.g., cars and drones) by employing appropriate user involvement schemes. This work is a recollection of our efforts in this space with the goal to contribute a comprehensive research agenda. Particular attention is paid to quantifying the network performance scaling and session continuity gains with ultra-dense moving cells. Our findings argue for non-incremental benefits of integrating moving access points on a par with conventional (static) cellular access infrastructure.",

   "abstract": "In modern wireless communication systems, wireless channel modeling has always been a fundamental task in system design and performance optimization. Traditional channel modeling methods, such as ray-tracing and geometry- based stochastic channel models, require in-depth domain-specific knowledge and technical expertise in radio signal propagations across electromagnetic fields. To avoid these difficulties and complexities, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) framework is proposed for the first time to address the problem of autonomous wireless channel modeling without complex theoretical analysis or data processing. Specifically, the GAN is trained by raw measurement data to reach the Nash equilibrium of a MinMax game between a channel data generator and a channel data discriminator. Once this process converges, the resulting channel data generator is extracted as the target channel model for a specific application scenario. To demonstrate, the distribution of a typical additive white Gaussian noise channel is successfully approximated by using the proposed GAN-based channel modeling framework, thus verifying its good performance and effectiveness.",

   "abstract": "The proliferation of IoTs beside the emergence of various cloud services push the horizon of edge computing. By offering cloud capabilities at the network edge closer to mobile devices, edge computing is a promising paradigm to resolve several vital challenges in IoTs, such as bandwidth saturation, energy constraints, low latency transmission, and data security and privacy. To provide a comprehensive understanding of edge computing supported by the integration of IoTs and cloud computing, that is, CoTs, this article first discusses some distinct research directions in CoTs with respect to edge computing. Given the significance of energy efficiency and sustainability of edge deployment in CoTs, we put forward a green and sustainable virtual network embedding framework for cooperative edge computing in wireless-optical broadband access networks. Specifically, we leverage a reliability function to confirm the number of backup edge devices, and embed virtual networks onto the suitable edge devices in CoTs. Finally, several research challenges and open issues are discussed.",

   "abstract": "This article identifies the unavoidably required upgrade of short-term realizable elastic optical networks (EONs) operating over single-mode fibers toward spectrally-spatially flexible optical networks (SS-FONs), exploiting spatial division multiplexing (SDM) technology in order to cope with the expected mid- and long-term future traffic forecasts. Since a complete EON to SS-FON network migration overnight is unrealistic, this article proposes a gradual greenfield migration strategy employing novel heuristic planning solutions. These solutions allow identifying which network components should be SDM-capable so as to support the forecasted traffic increase at a given time. To allow transmission in an SS-FON, links should be extended with SDM-capable fibers and nodes should be equipped with SDM-capable reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers. Using the proposed solutions, a migration case study in a national reference core network is provided and analyzed.",

These hardware constraints can seriously undermine the performance and deployment progress of mmWave systems and thus necessitate disruptive solutions in the cross-design of analog and digital modules. In this article, we discuss the importance of different hardware constraints and propose a novel system architecture that is able to release these hardware constraints while achieving better performance for future mmWave communication systems. The characteristics of the proposed architecture are articulated in detail, and a representative example is provided to demonstrate its validity and efficacy.",

   "abstract": "D2D networks have been employed in various mobile applications. Due to the limited wireless resource, a network cannot meet the data transmission requirements of all the users, especially in a data-intensive application. In such a scenario, a few users must temporarily disconnect from a network to guarantee the normal operation of the network. In a D2D network, the user access control strategy depends on the authenticity of CSI, since a user can be allocated more wireless resource and be allowed to stay in the network with a higher probability if the user has a higher CSI value. In this article, we investigate a heuristic learning method in which each user's CSI needs to be verified, and the users advocating a larger CSI are detected to be frauds. The results indicate that a dramatic increase of network performance can be captured by the proposed algorithm.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a human bond communication (HBC) method, based on head-mounted displays (HMDs), which enables continuous bidirectional communication among multiple users with or without Internet connections. The disadvantages of the existing technologies limit the scope of this study to provide a communication platform for HMD-based HBC. However, the features of the optical camera communication (OCC) technology will enrich the possibilities of HBC. This leads us to introduce a visual communication approach for virtual applications. To deploy OCC in HMDs for HBC, the camera of an HMD can be used as a receiver, while a near-infrared light source must be added to the HMD as a transmitter. We also discuss some potential future applications, suggest effective architectures, and briefly describe the scope, challenges, and solutions of OCC-based HMDs for HBC.",

   "abstract": "Recent advancements in wireless networks and sensor technologies have enabled continuous monitoring of remote patients. This has opened doors for exploring new frontiers in the domain of smart healthcare, especially patient monitoring and diagnosis. Scientists and researchers have scouted the novel domain of human bond communications (HBC), which suggests detection and transmission of information using all five human senses (sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste). HBC not only enables these senses to be replicated at a remote location but also helps in diagnosis of several ailments through monitoring. Such a holistic communication medium is facilitated through specialized devices that help healthcare experts in making crucial and timely data-driven decisions for their patients. In this work, we present state-ofthe- art research on HBC and possible interactions between HBC and remote healthcare. We present a model HBC framework to assist monitoring and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder patients. We also mention possible applications as well as challenges posed by HBC applications.",

   "abstract": "Low-power devices have manifested their crucial roles in manifold green Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including healthcare, smart home, industrial sensors, and wearable apparatuses. However, to prolong the operation time of these devices, significantly enhancing the battery capacity turns out to be an intractable challenge due to the mandatory constraint of limited form factors. Achieving this goal thus inevitably relies on new designs of physical-layer (PHY)and medium access control (MAC) schemes. This desire has driven IEEE 802.11 Task Group \"ba\" (TGba) to launch the normative work of wake-up radios (WURs) since 2017. To comprehend essential knowledge of this new technical feature, in this article, we consequently offer substantial insights of IEEE 802.11ba, including the deployment scenarios, PHY operations (waveform, modulation, data rate selection, and synchronization design), and MAC operations (radio wake-up procedure, WUR duty cycle, WUR mode, channel access scheme, and the format of a MAC packet data unit). The provided insights facilitate further research and implementation of IEEE 802.11ba WUR to empower the next generation green IoT.",

We describe our conceptual model and architecture, and the protocol we used by extending FIDO's UAF in order to provide both strong authentication and strong authorization. We built a pilot implementation for U.K. NHS patients to validate our implementation. Patients were able to use a mobile phone with a fingerprint reader to access restricted NHS sites in order to make and cancel appointments and order repeat prescription drugs. Our initial user trials with 10 U.K. NHS patients found the system to be easy to use, and fingerprints to be preferable to using usernames and passwords for authentication.",

   "abstract": "DSL relying on twisted pairs and on home-passed fiber network is still widely deployed in a large part of the world. However, its performance is severely restricted by the occurrence of impulsive noise. In this article, we present both the state-of-the-art and open research opportunities for impulsive noise mitigation in DSL. Its necessity is first discussed by briefly characterizing impulsive noise and outlining the deleterious effects imposed on the system. Then, the state-of-the-art is discussed by categorizing the mitigation techniques into those at the transmitter as well as into parametric and non-parametric mitigation solutions at the receiver, followed by a detailed comparison in terms of mitigation efficiency, spectral efficiency, computational complexity and processing delay. Open research opportunities are discussed from the perspective of noise modeling for parametric mitigation, advanced mitigation design and machine-learning aided mitigation.",

   "abstract": "Wind energy is one of the most attractive and one of the fastest growing sources of green energy in the world. With the expansion of wind parks, there is a growing need for an efficient coordination of the diverse energy production systems, as well as a tighter coupling between the production and the consumer side of the grid. Current grid operators have unnecessarily high costs due to the lack of an integrated management system toward a diverse set of proprietary network protocols, complex and error prone operation of the networks, as well as rigid security mechanisms. Network softwarization concepts, that is, SDN and NFV, offer great potential for reducing capital and operational expenditures by providing simplified network management and automated control. Recent works have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving stringent industrial-grade quality of service and fine grain security control with SDN and NFV. In this article, we provide an insight into wind park communication network requirements, analyze the technological benefits of the network softwarization, and demonstrate the economic profits in a case study of a typical Northwestern Europe wind park.",

   "abstract": "Current mobile network infrastructure has a hard time keeping up with the constant content demand by an increasing number of smart devices, in terms of both bandwidth and cost. At the same time, the advent of devices with relatively high resources (computing, communications, caching) allows offloading computation, control, cache, and communication near users, as in edge or fog networking. If we consider the caching resource, the basic challenges are: (i) How and who can form fogs for local content caching? (ii) How is interacting with the fog done for efficient content caching and retrieval? To address these, we leverage information-centric networking to propose IS-Fog, a social-aware fog network where the content is the first class citizen. We first classify a device's eligibility to provide content using novel content-based centrality. At the same time, we incentivize users to self-organize and share their devices' resources and cache in the fog. We then propose social-aware content caching and a distribution scheme to model fog interactions allowing nodes to collaboratively cache content locally. We evaluate IS-Fog using realistic mobility traces of 2986 nodes. Results show that IS-Fog is a more scalable and efficient content caching and distribution approach compared to existing schemes.",

   "abstract": "Emerging vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) applications are requiring a lot more communication and computation capabilities. Today's cloud infrastructures are not specifically designed to cope with the requirements presented by promising VANET applications. In this regard, fog computing focuses on moving computational resources toward the edge of the network to cater for these increasing processing and storage requirements. Thus, vehicular fog extends the fog computing paradigm to traditional vehicular networks that consist of several IoT devices. This overcomes the shortcomings of vehicular clouds by enabling ubiquitous vehicles, efficient communication, location-aware service provision, improved response time, and lower latency. This article presents fog-computing-based VANET architecture along with an infotainment application scenario. In the experiments, the cache size of fog nodes has been used as a parameter to evaluate its impact on different performance metrics in the fog-enabled VANET environment. We conclude the article by presenting various benefits of a fog-enabled VANET while investigating future challenges and their potential solutions.",

   "abstract": "The effectiveness of current military missions requires cooperation among different network entities of modern BN. Military missions have complex communication, storage, and computing requirements. Meanwhile, resilience is a very important capability for BN to survive disruptions and attacks. In this article, a new framework is proposed that integrates networking, storage, and computing resources to improve the resilience of BN. Three key components are defined in this framework: the intelligent data plane, the distributed management plane and the customized application plane. The intelligent data plane contains the facilities in charge of performing a set of manipulation strategies, including networking, storage, and computing operations. The distributed management plane consists of distributed controllers that are responsible for managing and scheduling resources of the data plane facilities. The customized application plane supports customized services for BN, including tactical data link, intelligence reconnaissance, and so on. The superiority of this new framework for BN is demonstrated by the simulation results. Besides, the open research issues of intelligence, safety, and effectiveness are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "By providing effective wireless vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, it is expected that the Internet of Vehicles will be provisioned, whereby various automotive service requirements could be satisfied (enhanced road safety, improved transportation efficiency, etc.). Despite the successful standardization of 802.11-based communication protocols in vehicular networks (e.g., 802.11p, 802.11af), there remains an essential issue, which is to adjust the transmission rate and mode to match the highly dynamic channel conditions in vehicular scenarios. In this article, we first investigate the requirements for intelligent link adaptation (LA) in 802.11 V2X, and then present a data-driven learning-based LA architecture that fits the road channel characteristics while capturing the quick variance due to the high mobility of vehicular networks. We also propose a reference model to show how the data-driven model can efficiently catch the channel variance and improve the \u201cdrive-thru Internet\u201d throughput. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges, which should provide significant reference for the development and standardization of the intelligent LA solution in 802.11 V2X networks.",

   "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC), which is deployed in the proximity area of the mobile user side as a supplement to the traditional remote cloud center, has been regarded as a promising technique for 5G heterogeneous networks. With the assistance of MEC, mobile users can access computing resource effectively. Also, congestion in the core network can be alleviated by offloading. To adapt in stochastic and constantly varying environments, augmented intelligence (AI) is introduced in MEC for intelligent decision making. For this reason, several recent works have focused on intelligent offloading in MEC to harvest its potential benefits. Therefore, machine learning (ML)-based approaches, including reinforcement learning, supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, as well as deep reinforcement learning for AI in MEC have become hot topics. However, many technical challenges still remain to be addressed for AI in MEC. In this article, the basic concept of MEC and main applications are introduced, and existing fundamental works using various ML-based approaches are reviewed. Furthermore, some potential issues of AI in MEC for future work are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The excessive use of digital devices such as cameras and smartphones in smart cities has produced huge data repositories that require automatic tools for efficient browsing, searching, and management. Data prioritization (DP) is a technique that produces a condensed form of the original data by analyzing its contents. Current DP studies are either concerned with data collected through stable capturing devices or focused on prioritization of data of a certain type such as surveillance, sports, or industry. This necessitates the need for DP tools that intelligently and cost-effectively prioritize a large variety of data for detecting abnormal events and hence effectively manage them, thereby making the current smart cities greener. In this article, we first carry out an in-depth investigation of the recent approaches and trends of DP for data of different natures, genres, and domains of two decades in green smart cities. Next, we propose an energy-efficient DP framework by intelligent integration of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics. Experimental evaluation on real-world surveillance data verifies the energy efficiency and applicability of this framework in green smart cities. Finally, this article highlights the key challenges of DP, its future requirements, and propositions for integration into green smart cities.",

   "abstract": "Modern cities are deploying smart, safe, and sustainable smart city services. However, such services are largely fragmented across cities because they are being developed based on proprietary IoT solutions or using different IoT standards. This creates a strong need to develop an approach to bridge disconnected smart cities and provide interoperability. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a guideline to mayors and other city officials for interconnecting their smart cities with other smart cities for interoperability. For this purpose, we propose three interworking models that can be selected based on the status of the cities to be connected with each other. All these models enable the continuity of IoT services between cities using different technologies, that is, a standardized interface, interworking proxy, and semantics. As only one model cannot be adapted to all the connected city cases, we thoroughly compare and analyze the models followed by introducing the pros and cons of each model.",

   "abstract": "NFV and SDN transform network management and operation into agile development tasks. They involve software artefacts, which are managed and deployed as composite services using DevOps principles. Those softwarized networks rely on complex technology stacks, starting with low-level virtualization technologies and ranging up to machine-learning-based orchestration solutions. One of the main challenges in those environments is to verify that the deployed functions and services operate correctly and meet the quality goals set by the stakeholders before they are put into production. We tackle this challenge by introducing the novel concept of a verification and validation (V&amp;V) platform for NFV, which enables automatic testing and qualification of single network functions and complex services. By adding such a platform to the NFV ecosystem, new business models emerge, as we discuss in this article. We evaluate our proposed concepts by presenting a case study that uses our open source V&amp;V platform to verify and validate the behavior and performance of a real-world network service.",

   "abstract": "The article explains the orientational beamforming concept from a perspective of spread-spectrum communication not in the frequency domain but in the spatial domain. In the orientational beamforming concept, radiated signal energy is spread over a certain part of or the entire angular range by a transmit array with randomly (practically pseudo-random) distributed antennas. At the receiving end, an identical pseudo-random array is employed so that the matching of the antenna distributions between the transmit and receive arrays spatially collects and recovers the signal of interest. An orientational alignment of identical arrays is exploited to perform the beamforming. We have observed that the newly discovered spatial domain can eliminate the necessity of knowing the signal direction to obtain beamforming. Consequently, the matched array processing system improves the interference suppression capability, especially when directional interfering signals exist. The concept is also applicable to the near-field scenario without being affected by spherical wavefront delays in forming an array beam. In this article, proposed orientational beamforming in combination with conventional directional beamforming is also discussed.",

   "abstract": "In the Internet Age, optical networks are vulnerable to numerous cyberattacks, and conventional key distribution methods suffer from the increased computational power. QKD can distribute information-theoretically secure secret keys between two parties based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Integrating QKD into optical networks can leverage existing fiber infrastructures with wavelength division multiplexing for the practical deployment of secret keys, and accordingly employ the secret keys for optical-layer security enhancement. Then, how to efficiently deploy and employ secret keys over QKD-integrated optical networks are emerging as two challenges. This article proposes a framework of key as a service (KaaS, i.e., providing secret keys as a service in a timely and accurate manner to satisfy the security requirements) to jointly overcome these two challenges. To enable the typical functions (i.e., secret-key deployment and employment) in KaaS, two secret-key virtualization steps, that is, key pool (KP) assembly and virtual key pool (VKP) assembly, are introduced. Also, we illustrate a new QKD-integrated optical network architecture from a holistic view, where the control layer is implemented by software defined networking for efficient network management. A time-shared KP assembly strategy and an on-demand VKP assembly strategy are presented for KaaS implementation. The success probabilities of KP assembly and VKP assembly are defined to evaluate the benefits of KaaS for efficiently deploying and employing secret keys as well as for security enhancement over QKD-integrated optical networks.",

   "abstract": "Besides technical skills, industry increasingly demands professional skills. Teaching these at university is challenging and still rare. In computer science, new technologies and relevant tools emerge quickly. Keeping curricula up to date is challenging. We present a teaching methodology that teaches students the art of teaching. Students learn how to communicate technical content efficiently in lecture, self-learning, and teamwork settings. Students work with constructive alignment and active listening. In addition, they learn how to assess self-learning training materials systematically, and how to give constructive feedback. Finally, they access a technical topic from a new dimension by practically teaching it. During the course, the students train the described skills under guidance by developing new exercises. The article presents our course unit that teaches important professional skills and produces a continuous stream of new teaching material, which is integrated into class. The unit enables teaching relevant and new technologies early. The presented methodology has been continuously applied at the Technical University of Munich since 2013. Through 2019, more than 150 students have participated. More than 60 new exercises were created. A structured evaluation shows the power of the approach.",

   "abstract": "IoT-enabled home appliances are still in their infancy, especially from the perspective of customers, which hinders widespread market penetration. To relieve this skeptical attitude of customers toward IoT appliances, it is important to design human-centric business models rather than corporate-centric ones. IoT ecosystems that make use of cognitive outputs from the social network of things can assist in the establishment of such business models. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, we propose a reference model that grants the absolute ownership of the fog-located digital twin (DT) of a home appliance to its owner and promotes human-centric services and applications on this twin by utilizing blockchains (BCs) and BC-enabled clouds. Second, by enabling customers to have absolute ownership rights over the fog-located DTs, the model paves the way for the liberalization of DTs as well as the appliances coupled to them, which is an important step in revealing the true value that underlies human-centricity and things-to-things collaboration.",

   "abstract": "Security issues represent the greatest obstacle to the growth of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paradigm, IoT applications are migrating to edge devices. As a result, potential security risks are arising, and unauthorized access to data from IoT edge devices is becoming a real concern. Thus, there is a need for a comprehensive, end-toend security approach since the system's more vulnerable point determines its overall security level. An edge device security system has to be built with a root of trust (i.e., something that is unclonable) and a chain of trust. Additionally, a security layer is necessary to ensure that different IoT applications execute isolated from each other in the device. In this sense, this article defines a security architecture that integrates trust mechanisms with embedded virtualization, providing security from hardware to applications. Our experiments show that the proposed architecture can be implemented with a smaller overhead and memory footprint compared to other proposed approaches in the literature, which makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.",

   "abstract": "The dramatic densification of connected mobile devices and the expected use cases from the vertical industry demand an innovative network design that meets upcoming stringent requirements. The adoption and harmonized integration of novel concepts, such as network functions virtualization and network programmability, enables the system to master the high expectation -- from the fifth generation communication network in support of flexibility -- to provide tailored and mutually isolated network slices, high performance, agility, and automation. This effectively involves a number of technical challenges for managing and orchestrating physical and virtualized slice resources by means of an advanced management and orchestration (MANO) system. This article sheds light on potential benefits and implementation aspects when the MANO framework is abstracted into customized and distributed MANO instances, thereby empowering the MANO-as-a-service (MANOaaS) paradigm. In particular, such distributed instances are provided to different network tenants for a greater level of control on requested network slice(s). The notion of management level agreements in the context of MANOaaS is introduced as well as differentiated per tenant while being embedded into the proposed architecture. We also position the proposed MANOaaS concept and associated extensions to the MANO reference architecture from the viewpoint of standardization bodies and ongoing open source projects.",

   "abstract": "Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) aims to make transportation system more intelligent through linking everything with the moving vehicles, but it brings geographical dynamic intrusions. However, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) of vehicles just deploy the preset statics strategies. As a novel security technology, blockchain can realize decentralized tamper- resistance. However, it has not been used for IDSs because of its rigid structure. In this article, we propose Micro-Blockchain based geographical dynamic Intrusion Detection, MBID, for V2X. A novel nested micro-blockchain structure is proposed, where each micro-blockchain deployed in a small region can construct local intrusion detection strategies for vehicles with tamper- resistance. When a vehicle moves to another region, spatial-temporal dynamic IDSs strategies are constructed through the proposed repeatedly nested scheme for micro-blockchains. Moreover, the control plane is proposed to dynamically configure IDSs strategies into the micro-blockchain. Simulation results show the accuracy of MBID.",

   "abstract": "With more and more autonomous deployments of wireless networks, accurate knowledge of the RF environment is becoming indispensable. Various techniques have been developed over the years that can not only assess the RF environment but can also characterize the various radio transmitters (sources) that define the ambient RF environment. Machine learning techniques have shown promise for such characterizations through the development of RF machine learning (RFML) systems delivering autonomous control. Although classical machine learning techniques work well for a large variety of tasks, they have not done as well for RFML. For RFML tasks, deep feature learners with an inherent recurrent structure have been shown to perform well. Even so, the field of RFML is still very young, and a lot needs to be done to bridge the gap between the ML community and the wireless community for RFML to be successfully applied for solving large-scale real-life problems. This article is a step in that direction.",

In this article, the challenges and opportunities of machine-learning-based data processing techniques for evaluation of V2V channel measurements are presented. This article reviews some state-of-the-art applications including identification of channel line-of-sight situations, tracking of MPCs, and MPC clustering. The data obtained with these methods form, inter alia, the basis for accurate channel models. Furthermore, some challenges of machine-learning-based data processing for V2V channel research are discussed as basis for future studies.",

   "abstract": "In Europe, market access for radio equipment is governed through the Radio Equipment Directive (RED), which replaced the Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R&amp;TTE) Directive in 2016. The essential requirements were introduced by RED and subsequently processed by European standards organizations: the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization, and the European Committee for Standardization, in order to develop harmonised standards (HSs). These HSs may be used by manufacturers in order to achieve self-declaration of conformity of radio equipment. Compared to the previously applicable R&amp;TTE Directive, RED contains a set of new Articles, including RED Articles 3(3)(a) to 3(3)(i) and Article 4, which were not enacted when RED was originally published. This article discusses the process for \"activating\" the corresponding articles, and provides commentary on related ongoing activities in European Commission Expert Groups and detailed implications on radio equipment design. Indeed, new requirements need to be met in order to achieve market access, such as reconfigurability, privacy, and security features. Finally, implications such as time to market and RED compliance certification cost are assessed, and a comparison to other regulation regimes is given, including those in the United States, Korea, and Russia.",

   "abstract": "Traffic demand in access networks has grown in recent years, and service providers need to upgrade their infrastructure to the latest access standards. While fiber has become the preferred technology of choice in access networks, there are many fibre access technologies available in the market. This poses challenging questions to operators that are not always easy to answer: How to upgrade? What technology and for how long wil it cope with the demands? In this article we model the traffic forecast in access networks for the next decade and analyze possible upgrade scenarios of fibre access networks, concluding which of the NG-PON flavors could better fit the demand.",

Among the various use cases supported by IEEE 802.11ay, fixed wireless access, a cost-efficient high-performance alternative and/ or complement to conventional fixed access, differentiates itself due to its unique requirements and characteristics. In this article, our goal is to identify and describe key elements incorporated into IEEE 802.11ay, including scheduling, beamforming, and link maintenance, that efficiently support fixed wireless access. IEEE 802.11ay is thus a viable and strong candidate to form the basis of future generations of standards-compliant (i.e., non-proprietary) mmWave fixed wireless access networks.",

   "abstract": "5G is designed to leverage on network softwarization technologies, like NFV and MEC, to expose customized network instances and resources at the edge of the infrastructure to vertical stakeholders. Most of the 5G success will depend on the ability to attract vertical stakeholders acting in the cloud, enabling them to smoothly port cloud applications to 5G, and to add performance and cognitive capabilities not supported in cloud environments. To this end, this article provides an insight into the possible architectural approaches to fully integrate vApps into the 5G infrastructure. The article follows a top-down approach. First, it provides an outlook on the state of the art in cloud application design, and on the new MEC and NFV capabilities. Then, on this basis, the analysis is devoted to identifying integration issues not yet fully addressed in standards specifications. Two alternative architectural approaches are discussed.",

   "abstract": "The concept of Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) has been recently proposed to provide diverse vehicle control and on-board infotainment services while improving road safety and transportation intelligence. However, with the increased number of on-road vehicles and their mobility, conventional C/U-plane coupled architecture, which incurs high latency and low reliability, brings many challenges to the future deployment and operation of vehicular networks. Meanwhile, the tightly coupled network functions with operating hardware in network equipment also hinders new service provisioning in IoV. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel IoV framework by exploiting the potential of C/U-plane decoupled network architecture and Software Defined Networking technology. To satisfy the requirements of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications in IoV, a virtualized radio access network, an integrated caching-computing- analyzing module, a scalable hierarchical C/U-plane scheme, and the corresponding programmable protocol configuration are developed to support the proposed framework. Mobility management, especially C-plane handoff management, is then analyzed through a typical case study. The analysis and simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can dramatically reduce latency and enhance reliability.",

Carefully coordinating both the WPT and wireless information transfer (WIT) yields an emerging research trend in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). However, SWIPT systems designed by assuming Gaussian distributed input signals may suffer from a substantial performance degradation in practice, when the finite alphabetical input is considered. In this article, we will provide a design guide of coding controlled SWIPT and study the modulation design in both single-user and multi-user SWIPT systems. We hope this guide may push SWIPT a step closer from theory to practice.",

   "abstract": "Crowd monitoring plays an integral role in crowd management processes and continues to receive growing interest across different public and commercial service sectors. In recent years, synergistic advances in different domains, such as computing, sensing, IoT, drones, and AI/ML, have empowered monitoring architectures with various enhancements in identifying patterns in crowd dynamics. However, efforts to examine affect in crowd monitoring considerations have been lacking in the current literature. In this work, we address this void by reviewing the recent advances and enabling technologies in affective sensing at both the individual and crowd levels. We also remark on deployment considerations in affective sensing architectures and key outstanding challenges.",

NEWTON is a Horizon 2020 European project that revolutionizes the educational process through innovative TEL methodologies and tools, integrated in a pan-European STEM-related learning network platform. This article focuses on one of these novel TEL methodologies (i.e., mulsemedia) and presents how NEWTON enables mulsemedia- enhanced teaching and learning of STEM subjects, with a particular focus on telecommunication and networking related modules. The article also discusses the very promising results of NEWTON case studies carried out with engineering students across two different universities in Spain and Ireland, respectively. The case studies focused on analyzing the impact on the learning process of the mulsemedia-enhanced teaching in the context of telecommunication and networking modules. The main conclusion of the article is that mulsemedia-enhanced education significantly increases students' learning experience and improves their knowledge gain.",

The corresponding evolutions of the network architecture as well as a framework for the cost modeling are shown. The starting point for future architecture evolutions is the ongoing wireline access rollout in Switzerland. Based on this, different evolution steps are possible. These architectures are described and compared to each other based on the cost modeling framework, which shows that for certain building sizes different options are cost optimal.",

   "abstract": "A recent study predicts that by 2020, up to 50 billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be connected to the Internet, straining the capacity of the wireless infrastructure, which has already been overloaded with data-hungry mobile applications. How to accommodate the demand for both massive-scale IoT devices and high-speed cellular services in the physically limited spectrum without significantly increasing the operational and infrastructure costs is one of the main challenges for operators. In this article, we introduce a new multi-operator network sharing framework that supports the coexistence of IoT and high-speed cellular services. Our framework is based on the radio access network sharing architecture recently introduced by 3GPP as a promising solution for operators to improve their resource utilization and reduce system roll-out cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework using real base station location data in the city of Dublin collected from two major operators in Ireland. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can almost double the total number of supported IoT devices that can be supported and simultaneously coexist with other cellular services.",

   "abstract": "mmWave communications have been shown to be feasible in future networks. Thanks to their very large available bandwidth, they have captured the interest of academia and industry alike as a key enabler to solve the spectrum crunch problem. Nevertheless, the new characteristics of mmWaves call for a paradigm change in wireless protocols and many challenges still remain unaddressed. Among these, an important feature to analyze is the use of multicast via point-to-multipoint communications to further increase spectrum efficiency, improve reliability and reduce the access point load. The combination of multicast and mmWaves presents many issues, starting with how the beams should be shaped to communicate to the users. This article will cover some important aspects at the intersection of the two technologies and, in particular, it will show that restricting the wireless links to be unicast only may be strongly suboptimal.",

   "abstract": "A detailed understanding of networks and network flows is key for many important operational problems, such as optimizing network performance, identifying causes of degradations or service-level fluctuations, and detecting security threats. However, gaining such insights remains a highly challenging task. This article presents a new approach for obtaining detailed behavioral and performance-related insights at the level of individual packets and flows, based on the concept of network-programmable operational flow profiling. Our approach leverages BPP, a novel networking framework which allows operational flow profiles to be programmed from the network edge without requiring heavy analytics and data collection frameworks.",

   "abstract": "Smart grid modernization and integration of Internet of electric vehicles (IoEVs) have attracted much attention due to their processing capability and convenience. In addition, the developments of magnetic resonance or inductive-based wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies can improve the efficiency of power transmission and user convenience. In particular, the use of renewable energy resources (RERs) is very attractive for low-carbon clean energy, and thus we can imagine integration services that utilize RERs and IoEVs. Accordingly, energy trading markets among IoEVs and power stations will appear in future smart grids. Thus, this article proposes an auction mechanism for energy trading markets of IoEV and RER power stations. Moreover, we can imagine a convenient system where IoEVs can automatically be charged from the WPT charging pad when they are parked in an IoEV parking lot. However, to realize such a convenient system, there are several problems that need to be resolved. Suppose that many IoEVs are parked in the parking lot; then due to power system constraints, it is impossible to simultaneously charge all IoEVs at maximum power. Therefore, an efficient load scheduling algorithm that allows several electric vehicle service equipments (EVSEs) to charge many IoEVs is required. Furthermore, when IoEVs are automatically charged in the anticipated convenient system, it is particularly challenging to design a suitable and secure billing system. In this article, we introduce the advantages of a convenient system that integrates IoEVs and a smart grid. We also discuss the challenges and solutions for future charging and billing systems.",

   "abstract": "mmWave radio, although instrumental for achieving the required 5G capacity KPIs, necessitates the need for a very large number of access points, which places an immense strain on the current network infrastructure. In this article, we try to identify the major challenges that inhibit the design of the Next Generation Fronthaul Interface in two upcoming distinctively highly dense environments: in Urban 5G deployments in metropolitan areas, and in ultra-dense Hotspot scenarios. Second, we propose a novel centralized and converged analog Fiber-Wireless Fronthaul architecture, specifically designed to facilitate mmWave access in the above scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages optical transceivers, optical add/drop multiplexers and optical beamforming integrated photonics towards a Digital Signal Processing analog fronthaul. The functional administration of the fronthaul infrastructure is achieved by means of a packetized Medium Transparent Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation protocol. Preliminary results show that the protocol can facilitate Gb/s-enabled data transport while abiding to the 5G low-latency KPIs in various network traffic conditions.",

   "abstract": "The kernel of the non-discrimination principle seems to be easily understandable, but actually a specific interpretation of it could be very knotty in the complicated FRAND context. A methodologically comparative illumination can be conducive to uncovering the inherent complexity of the non-discrimination principle. In addition, the non-discrimination prong of FRAND is unavoidably intertwined with non-disclosure agreements between SEP licensors and licensees. To achieve the goal of non-discrimination normally depends on sufficient disclosure of earlier comparable licensing terms regarding royalty rates, but confidentiality-related issues in this domain are still very intractable in reality. As an increasingly important jurisdiction over SEP-based legal disputes, China also encountered the problem of how to appropriately and satisfactorily interpret legal issues regarding the non-discrimination prong. Some potential challenges concerning non-discrimination issues in SEP-based cases in China may lie ahead. The theoretical and practical controversies over the non-discrimination prong of FRAND still exist globally, and thus more in-depth relevant research needs to be done, especially in the face of an upcoming era of unparalleled interconnectivity arising from 5G, IoT, AI, and so on.",

   "abstract": "NOMA has been recognized as a highly promising FRA technology to satisfy the requirements of the fifth generation era on high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. Since the EE has become a growing concern in FRA from both the industrial and societal perspectives, this article discusses the sustainability issues of NOMA. We first thoroughly examine the theoretical power regions of NOMA to show the minimum transmission power with fixed data rate requirement, demonstrating the EE performance advantage of NOMA over orthogonal multiple access. Then we explore the role of energy-aware resource allocation and grant-free transmission in further enhancing the EE performance of NOMA. Based on this exploration, a hybrid NOMA strategy that reaps the joint benefits of resource allocation and grant-free transmission is investigated to simultaneously accomplish high throughput, large connectivity, and low energy cost. Finally, we identify some important and interesting future directions for NOMA designers to follow in the next decade.",

   "abstract": "Non-orthogonal transmission is a promising technology enabler to meet the requirements of 5G communication systems. Seminal papers demonstrated that non-orthogonal multiplexing techniques outperform orthogonal schemes in terms of capacity, latency, and user fairness. Since it is envisioned that satellites will be an integral component of the 5G infrastructure, it is worth studying how satellite communication systems can benefit from the application of non-orthogonal transmission schemes as well. Contrary to common perception, current communications through a satellite present a different architecture and face different impairments than those in the wireless terrestrial links. In particular, this work aims to describe different non-orthogonal schemes that are suitable for the forward link (i.e., satellite to user). In contrast with the return link of the satellite (i.e., user to satellite), where the use of non-orthogonal transmission schemes has been widely studied, less effort has been devoted to the forward link. In light of this, this article provides an overview and a novel taxonomy that is based on the forward link of different non-orthogonal multibeam transmission schemes. Finally, guidelines that open new avenues for research in this topic are provided.",

   "abstract": "As air traffic control communication moves toward digital systems, there is an emerging trend toward supplementing or even fully substituting the traditional air-ground link in favor of communication between aircraft and satellites. In this article, we analyze coverage and security against wireless attacks of the novel satellite-based version of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology. We compare it to the widely deployed terrestrial ADS-B system, which is known to be insecure and is inherently unable to provide coverage in some parts of the global airspace, such as oceans and polar regions. Our analysis shows that satellites can provide vast advantages in such non-surveillance areas. However, they are as fundamentally insecure as terrestrial ADS-B.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the emerging idea of Age of Information (AoI) that quantifies freshness of information and explore its possible role in the efficient design of freshness-aware Internet of Things (IoT). We start by summarizing the concept of AoI and its variants with emphasis on the differences between AoI and other well-known performance metrics in the literature, such as throughput and delay. Building on this, we explore freshness-aware IoT design for a network in which IoT devices sense potentially different physical processes and are supposed to frequently update the status of these processes at a destination node (e.g., a cellular base station). Inspired by recent interest, we also assume that these IoT devices are powered by wireless energy transfer by the destination node. For this setting, we investigate the optimal sampling policy that jointly optimizes wireless energy transfer and scheduling of update packet transmissions from IoT devices with the goal of minimizing long-term weighted sum-AoI. Using this, we characterize the achievable AoI region. We also compare this AoI-optimal policy with the one that maximizes average throughput (throughput-optimal policy), and demonstrate the impact of system state on their structures. Several promising directions for future research are also presented.",

   "abstract": "High-capacity TDM-PONs, TWDM PONs, and WDM PONs have great potential to be used as next-generation PONs in emerging broadband services for various applications. As PONs typically use direct detection techniques and low-cost components, transmission impairments become one of the main limiting factors. Various transmission impairment compensation techniques, including both optical and digital signal processing (DSP) based techniques, are proposed and demonstrated for high-speed TDM-, TWDM-, and WDM-PONs. In this article, we describe the next-generation PON schemes and principles of different compensation techniques. We propose filter type optical compensation and Volterra type electrical compensation techniques to compensate nonlinear inter-symbol interference caused by vestigial sideband, limited modulation bandwidth, in-phase and quadrature imbalance, dispersion, and square-law detection. In addition, analyses and comparison of the equilibrium performances, features, characteristics, and applicability of the various optical- and electrical-domain compensation schemes are presented.",

   "abstract": "The initial components of New Radio (NR) technology are being discussed within the 3GPP with the aim of not only satisfying the urgent needs of the 5G market but also the long-term requirements that network operators want to provide to customers. An expected solution to start delivering value immediately for the 5G systems is represented by LTE-NR tight-interworking, also known in the 3GPP specifications as EN-DC. With this new network architecture, existing LTE radio and core networks are used as a master entity for mobility management and coverage while adding a new secondary 5G carrier. In this article, we will illustrate the concepts and key features that 3GPP has specified for LTE-NR tight-interworking regarding the control and user plane domains. Our supporting performance evaluations highlight that EN-DC, at least in certain scenarios expected to exist in early deployments, is able to deliver better coverage and capacity compared to standalone LTE and NR technologies deployed alone.",

   "abstract": "Enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communications in 5G wireless networks creates challenging design requirements, particularly on the air interface. The stringent latency and reliability targets require enhancements at different layers of the protocol stack. On the other hand, the Parallel Redundancy Protocol, wherein each data packet is duplicated and transmitted concurrently over two independent networks, provides a simple solution for improving reliability and reducing latency in wireless networks. PRP can be realized in cellular networks through the dual connectivity solution. Recently, 3GPP has introduced packet duplication functionality in 5G wireless networks. To this end, this article provides an overview of the packet duplication functionality in 5G in light of recent developments within 3GPP, and also highlights the related technical challenges.",

Achieving secure vehicular communications is vital for the deployment of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. This article provides a comprehensive overview of physical-layer security (PLS) strategies employed for V2X. By exploiting the randomness and the physical characteristics of wireless channels, PLS offers reliable solutions against eavesdropper attacks as complementary approaches to cryptographic techniques. We give a brief introduction to the architecture and characteristics of V2X networks. Then the fundamental principles of PLS technology are proposed, followed by security threats in V2X. Additionally, we discuss some open issues and challenges for future research. Finally, we investigate a case study where different challenges and technologies coexist in one V2X scenario.",

In this article, we show that 5G NR technology can also facilitate high-accuracy continuous localization and tracking of HSTs. Furthermore, we describe and demonstrate how the NR network can utilize the continuous location information for efficient beam management and beamforming, as well as for downlink Doppler precompensation in the single-frequency network context. Additionally, with particular focus on millimeter-wave networks, novel concepts for low-latency inter-carrier interference (ICI) estimation and compensation, due to residual Doppler and oscillator phase noise, are described and demonstrated. The provided numerical results at 30 GHz operating band show that sub-meter positioning and sub-degree beam direction accuracies can be obtained with very high probabilities on the order of 95-99 percent. The results also show that the described Doppler precompensation and ICI estimation and cancellation methods substantially improve the throughput of the single-frequency HST network.",

   "abstract": "Due to the progressively growing energy demand, electricl vehicles (EVs) are increasingly replacing unfashionable vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines. The new era of modern grid is aiming to unlock the possibility of resource coordination between EVs and power grid. The goal of including vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is to enable shared access to power resources. To define the initiative, this article investigates the bidirectional power flow between EVs and the main grid. The article provides a new algorithm framework for energy optimization that enables real-time decision making to facilitate charge/discharge processes in grid connected mode. Accordingly, the energy flow optimization, communications for data exchange, and local controller are joined to support system reliability for both power grid and EV owners at parking lot sites. The local controller is the key component that collects the EV data for decision making through real-time communications with EV platforms. The main responsibility of this controller is managing the energy flow during the process of real-time charging without impacting the basic functionalities of both grid and EV systems. Finally, a case study of a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder is proposed to validate the impact of energy flow optimization using V2G technology. This visionary concept provides improvement in grid scalability and reliability to grid operations through accessing EV power storage as a complementary resource of future energy systems.",

   "abstract": "The growing trend of video traffic and ubiquitous Internet of Things applications have created substantial challenges for the host-centric communication model of today's Internet. As the major consumers of video applications and IoT devices, smart homes have become one of the critical components in the Internet ecosystem. In this article, we introduce a novel concept of intelligent and programmable home routers to power smart homes in the information-centric networking (ICN) architecture, which advocates a new content- centric communication paradigm for efficient content distribution and improved cybersecurity. The main features of the envisioned home ICN routers include at-edge cooperative caching for efficient content distributions, content modeling for security monitoring, and a delegation model of security operations between intelligent home ICN routers with resource-constrained IoT devices. The envisioned home ICN routers with much desired characteristics are a promising direction for addressing the rising challenges in operating, managing, and securing millions of smart home networks in the ICN architecture.",

In this article we propose to use LiFi, which is based on off-the-shelf LEDs, as an enabler for the IoT in indoor environments. We present LiFi4IoT, a system which, in addition to communication, provides three main services that the radio frequency (RF) IoT networks struggle to offer: precise device positioning; the possibility of delivering power, since energy can be harvested from light; and inherent security due to the propagation properties of visible light. We analyze the application space of IoT in indoor scenarios, and propose a LiFi4IoT access point (AP) that communicates simultaneously with IoT devices featuring different types of detectors, such as CMOS camera sensors, PDs, and solar cells. Based on the capabilities of these technologies, we define three types of energy self-sufficient IoT \"motes\" and analyze their feasibility. Finally, we identify the main research directions to enable the LiFi4IoT vision and provide preliminary results for several of these.",

Nevertheless, wireless technologies have disadvantages in spectrum shortage, reliability, and latency, posing challenges to implementing a practical, reliable, and integrated power communication network. This article introduces such a wireless machine-type communication (MTC) system - a pioneering work currently under development as a national standard devoted to eIoT in the 230 MHz frequency band licensed to the power and energy industries by the State Radio Regulatory Commission of China. It may be seen as an example of a national-level wireless communication system for eIoT. In particular, this article discusses the unique characteristics of the 230 MHz spectrum allocated to eIoT, describes the eIoT requirements and challenges, and addresses their impacts on both system architecture and physical air interface. Finally, a service-centric MTC system is presented to demonstrate the key design concept and practical solutions to the specific eIoT requirements.",

   "abstract": "Future traffic information through vehicular communication allows connected and automated vehicles to optimize their speed trajectories and drive more safely and efficiently through predictive controllers. Sharing accurate information about the vehicle allows such controllers to perform best, but may raise privacy concerns. To improve privacy guarantee over the shared information while preserving its utility for predictive controllers, this article proposes a novel information perturbation mechanism, as opposed to the baseline of independently perturbing the data in each broadcast. Specifically, the mechanism is applied to the transmitted vehicle speed, and this perturbed data is used in an optimal speed planner to design a fuel and emissions efficient speed trajectory. Results show a deterioration of the controller performance when privacy is taken into consideration under the baseline method. With the proposed method, the controller performance is improved while providing the same privacy guarantee. It is shown that controller design is also affected by the choice of perturbation mechanism.",

   "abstract": "Fog computing has enabled the extension of cloud computing functions to the network edge by assisting the cloud and users in terms of communication, computation, and storage with a widely spread deployment of edge devices or fog nodes, as they become more powerful in capacities and functionalities. Smart grid is becoming the next-generation power grid and will automate reliable electricity distribution for millions of customers. However, the data transmitted in smart grid communications has reached the terabyte level and the mishandling of smart meter readings may lead to customers' privacy leakage. In this article, we present an architecture of fog-based smart grid, discuss its applications, security and privacy challenges, and introduce several state-of-the-art works. We also propose a privacy-preserving authentication and data aggregation scheme for fog-based smart grid. Specifically, we use short randomizable signature and blind signature to provide anonymous authentication in a conditional way, and then we utilize fog nodes to solve billing problems after anonymous authentication. Also, we aggregate the smart meter readings by the homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, we aim to attract more attention to this emerging topic by giving some interesting future directions.",

   "abstract": "The privacy of individuals in the context of mobile networks is crucial nowadays. Nevertheless, too few improvements have been made over the years to secure the privacy of subscribers. As a consequence, current generations of mobile networks, including 4G/LTE, are susceptible to sensitive information leakage. In particular, individuals are exposed to location disclosure and movement tracking by revealing subscribers' permanent identifiers. In this article, we discuss the subscribers' private identification problem in light of the recent standardization for 5G. We introduce the problem and discuss existing cryptographic solutions, with a focus on the ECIES-based solution adopted for 5G. We then investigate to what extent the privacy protection mechanisms introduced by the 5G security architecture answer our problem. Finally, we identify challenges, and we distinguish domains of interest and specific research activities to address these challenges.",

   "abstract": "Deploying NFV technologies to the edge networks has attracted growing attention in the stateof- the-art studies. In this article, we first review the most recent work on the topic of applying NFV to edge networks. Then, we identify that an urgent research challenge is to provide proactive failure recovery (shorten as failover hereafter) mechanism for the NFV-enabled distributed edge computing. To address this issue, we propose a novel management architecture that supports the proactive failover mechanism while provisioning NFV services in distributed edge computing. Simulation results show that the proposed proactive failover mechanism outperforms the reactive manner significantly in terms of latency spending on failover operations. We hope this article can spur deeper studies on the proactive intelligent resilience mechanism for deploying NFV in distributed edge computing and other related edge intelligence topics.",

   "abstract": "The platooning application has a significantly higher safety messaging rate requirement that could threaten harmonious coexistence with nearby non-platoon vehicles. We explore an alternative delivery mode for platoon communication in order to address the issue. The proposed mode is called pseudo-broadcast, since it emulates broadcast using unicast. In pseudo-broadcast, the platoon member with the worst reception condition is designated as the destination of the unicast from the leader vehicle. Then other platoon members promiscuously receive the unicast packet. And vice versa, the messages from the platoon followers to the leader are pseudo-broadcast to the leader. The unicast transmission in pseudo-broadcast allows timely retransmission, which is not possible with broadcast. It not only improves the reliability of platoon communication, but also helps minimize the additional beaconing activity in meeting the required latency bound. Consequently, it lessens the abusive bandwidth impact on the non-platoon vehicles in the vicinity, fostering harmonious coexistence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that looks in detail into the question of coexistence between platooning vehicles and others sharing the same channel, and also provides some first insights into its quantitative effects.",

   "abstract": "Next-generation wireless ecosystems are expected to comprise heterogeneous technologies and diverse deployment scenarios. Ensuring quality of service (QoS) will be one of the major challenges on account of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of network and service providers in these environments. In this context, ITU-T is working on defining new Recommendations related to QoS and users' quality of experience (QoE) for the 5G era. Considering the new ITU-T QoS framework, we propose a methodology to develop a global QoS management model for next generation wireless ecosystems taking advantage of big data and machine learning (ML). The methodological approach is based on the use of supervised and unsupervised ML techniques in order to identify both the KQIs relevant for the users and the network performance (NP) anomalies. The proposed methodology links the NP and QoE via inductive ML algorithms and provides information about the areas where corrective actions are required. The results from a case study conducted to validate the model in real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios are also presented.",

The design of the user equipment (UE) state machine is one of the central questions related to the overall control plane design. In this article, we present a state machine for 5G that consists of a novel Radio Resource Control (RRC) Connected Inactive state in addition to the conventional RRC Idle and RRC Connected states. In RRC Connected Inactive, the UE Context is stored in the UE and in the network, and the connection between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Core Network (CN) is kept active to minimize control plane latency and UE power consumption during state transition. In addition, RRC Connected Inactive is configurable so that requirements of diverse 5G use cases can be fulfilled without increasing the overall number of RRC states. Performance analysis shows that RRC Connected Inactive can achieve up to 8x latency improvement, 5x power efficiency and 3.5x signaling overhead reduction, when compared to Long Term Evolution (LTE) RRC Idle.",

   "abstract": "Pervasive healthcare services with smart decision making capability and ubiquitous communication technologies can forge future smart communities. Real-time health surveillance for early detection of life-threatening diseases through advanced sensing and communication technology can provide better treatment, reduce medical expenses and save lives of community residents (i.e., patients). However, the assurance of data privacy is the prime concern for such smart health technologies. This research aims to describe a privacy-preserving cloud-based system for real-time health surveillance through change detection of multiple vital health signs of smart community members. Vital signs data generated from IoT-enabled wearable devices are processed in real-time in a cloud environment. This article focuses on the development of a predictive model for the smart community considering the sensitivity of data processing in a third-party environment (e.g., cloud computing). We developed a vital sign change detection system using Holt's linear trend method (to enable prediction of data with trends) where fully homomorphic encryption is adapted to perform computations on an encrypted domain that can ensure data privacy. Moreover, to reduce the overhead of the fully homomorphic encryption method over large medical data we introduced a parallel approach for encrypted computations using a MapReduce algorithm of Apache Hadoop. We demonstrated the proposed model by evaluating some case studies for different vital signs of patients. The accuracy and efficiency of the implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for building a smart community.",

The goal of this article is to reason out functional communication requirements for VCTS using a bottom-up approach and introduce challenges of the railway domain to readers of the communication community. Three different VCTS configurations in terms of sensor and communication concepts are presented, and quantitative examples of communication requirements are given for different application scenarios. To conclude, the ability of some technology candidates to fit these requirements is analyzed and compared in relation to each application scenario.",

   "abstract": "With significantly improved efficiency, largescale hybrid antenna arrays with tens to hundreds of antennas have great potential to support millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication for high-speed railway (HSR) applications. The significant beamforming gains rely on fast and accurate estimation of the angle-of-arrival (AoA), but this can be impeded by the high train speed, the cost/energy oriented design of arrays, and the severe attenuation of mmWave signals. This article reviews these challenges, and discusses the limitations of existing AoA estimation techniques under hybrid antenna array settings. The article further reveals a few recent theoretical breakthroughs that can potentially enable fast and reliable estimation, even based on severely attenuated signals. Under a speed setting of 500 km/h, a performance study is carried out to confirm the significant improvements of estimation accuracy and subsequent beamforming gains as the results of the breakthroughs.",

To provide reliable communication services, key 5G communication technologies, such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), and potential architectures, such as coordinated multipoint and mobile relay station, are considered in future railway communications. New technologies and architectures will bring new channel propagation characteristics. Accurate channel models that can capture these channel characteristics play a critical role in the design and test of future railway communication systems. This article reviews the HST channel measurements conducted in different scenarios and frequency bands, and the advanced HST channel models.

Optimizing the data return from these missions requires planning, design, standards, and operations coordinated from formulation and development throughout the mission. The use of automation enhanced by cognition and machine learning are potential methods for optimizing data return, reducing costs of operations, and helping manage the complexity of the automated systems. In this article, we discuss the potential role of machine learning in the linkto- link aspect of the communication systems. An experiment using NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Testbed onboard the International Space Station and the ground station located at NASA John H. Glenn Research Center demonstrates for the first time the benefits and challenges of applying machine learning to space links in the actual flight environment. The experiment used machine learning decisions to configure a space link from the ISS-based testbed to the ground station to achieve multiple objectives related to data throughput, bandwidth, and power. Aspects of the specific neural-network-based reinforcement learning algorithm formation and on-orbit testing are discussed.",

   "abstract": "Wireless optical communications (WOC) has carriers up to several hundred terahertz, which offers several advantages, such as ultrawide bandwidth and no electromagnetic interference. Conventional WOC technologies that use light transmitters such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), directed LEDs, and lasers are facing major challenges in attenuation or tracking. Resonant beam communications (RBCom) meets the requirements of low attenuation, non-mechanical mobility, and multiple access. However, RBCom channel undergoes echo interference in contrast to common non-echo channels. An interference elimination method based on optical filtering is presented along with an exemplary interference-free RBCom system.",

   "abstract": "ICN names data rather than hosts and then directly relays packets according to data names. This fundamental shift in naming from host-dependent to host-independent enables ICN to cache data for future service in its network. Therefore, ICN acts as not only a tunnel to transmit data but also a temporary cache of data, which inevitably confronts data attacks. In this article, for the first time, we investigate caching security from a system recovery perspective, and find that ICN attacked by typical caching attacks can be eventually recovered to the normal state if in-network security on data is provided. However, it may cause concern about the recovery time. To address this concern, we introduce a lightweight solution to shorten the recovery period of ICN by constructing and managing trusted zones with Dual Tunnels among Routers in a Penalty-Feedback Way (Duty). The feasibility and effectiveness of our design are verified by the experimental evaluations on real topology. Our work indicates a new perspective in the cache security of ICN and addresses some future work.",

   "abstract": "Supporting ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is a major challenge of 5G wireless networks. Stringent delay and reliability requirements need to be satisfied for both scheduled and non-scheduled URLLC traffic to enable a diverse set of 5G applications. Although physical and media access control layer solutions have been investigated to satisfy scheduled URLLC traffic, there is lack of study on enabling transmission of non-scheduled URLLC traffic, especially in coexistence with the scheduled URLLC traffic. Machine learning (ML) is an important enabler to manage this coexistence scenario due to its ability to exploit spatial/ temporal correlation in user behaviors and use of radio resources. In this article, we first study the coexistence design challenges, especially the radio resource management (RRM) problem, and propose a distributed risk- aware ML solution for RRM. The proposed solution benefits from hybrid orthogonal/non-orthogonal radio resource slicing, and proactively regulates the spectrum needed for satisfying the delay/reliability requirement of each URLLC traffic type. A case study is introduced to investigate the potential of the proposed RRM in serving coexisting URLLC traffic types. The results further provide insights on the benefits of leveraging intelligent RRM. For example, a 75 percent increase in data rate with respect to the conservative design approach for the scheduled traffic is achieved, while the 99.99 percent reliability of both scheduled and non-scheduled traffic types is satisfied.",

   "abstract": "The concept of smart city has been flourishing based on the prosperous development of various advanced technologies: mobile edge computing (MEC), ultra-dense networking, and software defined networking. However, it becomes increasingly complicated to design routing strategies to meet the stringent and ever changing network requirements due to the dynamic distribution of the crowd in different sectors of smart cities. To alleviate the network congestion and balance the network load for supporting smart city services with dramatic disparities, we design a deep-reinforcement- learning-based smart routing algorithm to make the distributed computing and communication infrastructure thoroughly viable while simultaneously satisfying the latency constraints of service requests from the crowd. Besides the proposed algorithm, extensive numerical results are also presented to validate its efficacy.",

Low multicast data rates and poor coexistence with other services are just some of the challenges that must be faced when deploying multicast solutions over WiFi. In this article we present SDN@Play, a centralized approach to manage multicast flows based on software-defined networking (SDN) principles. We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of SDN@Play that can be used in several scenarios ranging from vehicular networks to in-flight entertainment systems, and from enterprise group to machine type communications applications. Finally, we make the prototype fully available to researchers and practitioners under a permissive APACHE license.",

   "abstract": "The SMART-Navigation project aims to develop a next-generation maritime safety integrated management system based on the e-Navigation concept of the IMO. The purpose of the pilot LTE-Maritime project is to construct test zones and establish effective LTE-Maritime plans based on the pilot test results. The spectrum band for LTE-Maritime system is the licensed public radio frequency band over 718-728 MHz for UL and 773-783 MHz for DL, but this band is shared with the Public Safety LTE (PS-LTE) and LTE-Railway (LTE-R) systems. Because these systems share the same spectrum band, CCI from PS-LTE and LTE-R arises during the Pilot LTE-Maritime test. To resolve this issue, we perform a test on the East Sea (around the city of Gangneung) in Korea with the proposed radio access network RAN-Sharing technique. In addition to the proposed RAN-Sharing technique, this article addresses the system architecture, requirements, test environment, and results of the LTE-Maritime system.",

   "abstract": "Blockchain is increasingly being used to provide a distributed, secure, trusted, and private framework for energy trading in smart grids. However, existing solutions suffer from a lack of privacy, processing and packet overheads, and reliance on trusted third party (TTP) to secure the trade. To address these challenges, we propose a secure private blockchain (SPB) framework. SPB enables energy producers and consumers to directly negotiate the energy price. To reduce the associated overheads, we propose a routing method which routes packets based on the destination public key (PK). SPB eliminates the reliance on TTP to ensure both energy producer and consumer commit to their obligations by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The latter consists of two transactions: first the consumer generates a CTP transaction, committing to pay the energy price to the producer. On receipt of the energy, the smart meter of the consumer generates an energy receipt confirmation (ERC) which triggers a smart contract to transfer the committed price in CTP to the energy producer. To verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart meter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters to prevent malicious nodes from linking ERC transactions and thus enhance the user privacy. Qualitative security analysis shows the resilience of SPB against a range of attacks. Implementation results demonstrate that SPB reduces monetary cost and delay compared to existing solutions.",

Recent scandals such as the one involving Cambridge Analytics proved that social media users are prone to such direct manipulation. Among the weapons available to perform these anti-democracy attacks, Social Bots are beyond question the most powerful one. These autonomous entities constitute coordinated armies that sneakily manipulate and deceive real users. Thus, our research identifies five major challenges that the research community needs to face toward tackling Social Bots activities in four individual but comparable scenarios. To address these key challenges, we propose, elaborate, and evaluate a mix of remedies in the form of a proof-of-concept platform combining the agility of artificial intelligence with the expertise of human analysts to detect and shield against Social Bots interference.",

   "abstract": "SDN brings new opportunities to alleviate the existing security deficiencies of traditional networks. However, it also introduces new issues, a primary one being the vulnerabilities related to data and control plane communications. This work presents a security architecture to address security problems regarding data exchange in software-defined networks. To this end, a cryptographic key generation application is proposed to generate certificates that are used for securing communication of SDN entities (controller, switch, and application). We also provide an overview of related literature focusing on key elements in such architecture. In our model, TLS can be activated between SDN nodes to provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and authorization with special certificate fields. Besides, an integrated security module further strengthens the communication security by applying ACL, hardening TLS configuration and reducing the impact of private key hijacking. It also facilitates security administration tasks via per-channel activation/ deactivation of TLS protocol and monitoring of real-time security alarms.",

   "abstract": "Named data networking (NDN) enables fast and efficient content dissemination in mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle ad hoc networks (UAANETs); however, its in-network caching mechanism brings a new security challenge: content poisoning. Poisoned content can contaminate the cache on the routers and isolate valid content from the network, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. To mitigate such attacks and enhance network-layer trust of NDN-based UAANETs, this article proposes a novel and systematic framework that integrates interest-key-content binding (IKCB), forwarding strategy, and on-demand verification to efficiently discover poisoned content. To further provide decentralized IKCB store and detect internal attackers, we introduce a lightweight permissioned blockchain system over NDN and develop a scalable adaptive delegate consensus algorithm. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed framework can effectively purge poisoned content with low overhead, and our algorithms achieve great performance to fit UAANETs.",

   "abstract": "3GPP is currently finalizing the first publication of 5G specifications in their Release 15. Several new features and concepts are introduced to the radio interface and the core network in order to enhance the softwarization and virtualization of functional entities in the mobile core network. One of the driving new concepts is the service-based architecture (SBA). Service concepts and technologies are already well established in the area of Internet-based platforms and applications. With the 3GPP 5G SBA, flexible and on-demand service composition - even across organizational boundaries - provides a new level of flexibility and business opportunities to the mobile industry. However, this type of service orientation comes with new security implications that have not been present to their full extent in previous mobile network generations. This article introduces the foundational security concepts and technologies of SBA in 3GPP 5G, focusing mainly on non-roaming scenarios, and discusses security challenges arising from these architectural changes.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a knowledge mining model, where a city can plan its development based on existing knowledge during city expansion, for example, telecommunication resource allocation and crowd forecasts in a new region. Unlike most works that focused on Internet-of- Things (IoT) sensing, this study is aimed at urban planning by using harvested data, from the perspective of city architects. For large-scale metropolitan areas, a massive amount of data is generated every day, either from static surveys or dynamic IoT sensing. For urban planners, data collection is not their primary concern. How to transfer harvested knowledge from exiting parts of the city to suburban/rural/untapped areas is a new challenge. This is because those areas still lack sufficient statistics, and the density of IoT deployment is low. Therefore, development is risky and uncertain. To exploit new regions requires knowledge inference. Such a transition needs data interpretation from historical city dynamics, involving sensor deployment, human activities, and resource allocation in the vicinity. With the proposed model, a city can estimate the requirement for resources when the peripheral areas on the outskirts of a city develop. The same model can be applied to enterprises for resource deployment, and applications are not merely limited to governments.",

   "abstract": "It is challenging to efficiently manage different resources in the IoT. Recently, Network function virtualization has attracted attention because of its prospect to achieve efficient resource management for IoT. In NFV-enabled IoT infrastructure, a service function chain (SFC) is composed of an ordered set of virtual network functions (VNFs) that are connected based on the business logic of service providers. However, the inefficiency of the SFC embedding process is one major problem due to the dynamic nature of IoT networks and the abundance of IoT terminals. In this article, we decompose the complex VNFs into smaller VNF components (VNFCs) to make more effective decisions since VNF nodes and physical network devices are usually heterogeneous. In addition, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme with experience replay and target network is proposed as a solution that can efficiently handle complex and dynamic SFC embedding scenarios. Simulation results present the efficient performance of the proposed DRL-based dynamic SFC embedding scheme.",

   "abstract": "Many real-world services can be provided through multiple virtual network function (VNF) graphs, corresponding, for example, to high- and low-complexity variants of the service itself. Based on this observation, we extend the concept of service scaling in network orchestration to service shifting, that is, upgrading or downgrading the VNF graph to use among those implementing the same service. Service shifting can serve multiple goals, from reducing operational costs to reacting to infrastructure problems. Furthermore, it enhances the flexibility of service-level agreements between network operators and third-party content providers (verticals). In this article, we introduce and describe the service shifting concept, its benefits, and the associated challenges, with special reference to how service shifting can be integrated within real-world 5G architectures and implementations. We conclude that existing network orchestration frameworks can be easily extended to support service shifting, and its adoption has the potential to make 5G network slices easier for the operators to manage under highload conditions, while still meeting the verticals' requirements.",

   "abstract": "Energy harvesting from ambient energy sources has gained increased attention due to its advantage of less maintenance and for removing the dependency on batteries in IWSNs. However, due to the dynamic nature of ambient energy sources and the position of harvesting nodes, energy-harvesting is not always available, resulting in unbalanced energy-harvesting in IWSNs. Although, some battery operated nodes are used, the limited lifetime problem still exists due to the non-harvesting nodes. In this article, we propose a scheme that combines the advantages of energy-harvesting and sleep-scheduling in hybrid solar energy-harvesting IWSNs and non-harvesting nodes. We present a model of the harvesting-node using a three-state Markov chain. The proposed harvest-use-store type architecture aims to guarantee an energy-neutral condition to avoid energy harvesting nodes from early energy exhaustion. The proposed approach allows to wake up a few more non-harvesting nodes to handle network coverage and connectivity during less-energy-harvesting intervals. Similarly, non-harvesting nodes are allowed to sleep by increasing the default transmission range of the solar-harvesting nodes during higher energy harvesting intervals prolonging network lifetime.",

   "abstract": "WBANs offer a variety of medical applications and have received considerable attention in recent years. Due to the limited energy of sensors, prolonging network lifetime is of paramount importance for WBANs. Although duty-cycling techniques can conserve energy consumption and energy harvesting techniques can provide extra energy supply, the former leads to huge data delivery delay and the latter cannot supply energy infinitely and stably. Therefore, how to maximize network lifetime at low latency is still an open and challenging problem. In this article, we introduce a three-level sleep scheduling strategy for EH-WABNs. The first level is sensor node scheduling, which minimizes the number of sensors in an active sensor group. The second level is active sensor group discovery, which finds the maximum number of active sensor groups to enable alternate work in different frames to the greatest extent. The third level is active sensor group scheduling, which assigns an active sensor group in each frame. Importantly, this article provides a novel route to reduce energy consumption in EH-WBNAs, i.e. a combination of sensor sleep scheduling and energy harvesting, and we believe that this design can also be useful for other network scenarios.",

   "abstract": "Future IoT is expected to achieve ubiquitous access and information exchange on a global scale. Facing the massive IoT access and spectrum shortage problems, centralized control becomes prohibitively complicated. But with the increasing capability of IoT devices in communications and computing, IoT will gradually evolve to be highly autonomous, yield social features in IoT networking, and eventually form the smart IoT community. Motivated by the tendency of socialization over IoT, this article first presents an overview and discussions on social features affecting connections among IoT devices. Then, we propose studies to characterize the highly-varying social features by using the queuing model and asymptotic analysis framework. With emphases on social features including credit and reputation, we show how to fit transmissions between IoT devices to the framework for socially-aware optimization. Finally, this article shares opinions about open problems and future topics on socially-aware design toward the smart IoT community.",

   "abstract": "It is a matter of fact that social ties drive communications during most of our daily activities. This observation has inspired research activities aimed at exploiting the properties of social networks to implement novel networking paradigms, applications models, and middleware platforms. In this work, we leverage social networking technologies and concepts toward the definition of a novel network primitive for IoT. The new primitive, called Sociocast, enables trusted group-oriented communications, in-network publish/ subscribe mechanisms, dynamic and selective firewalling, and flexible data casting. In this article we present an architectural solution together with the primitive syntax, show some performance results, and discuss open research issues.",

   "abstract": "In wireless communications, as the spatio-temporal distribution of the traffic is dynamic, the performance degradation of cellular networks becomes inevitable. Especially in catastrophic scenarios or hot-spot areas, terrestrial base stations may be poorly functioning and/or congested; thus, deploying ASCs that were carried by a UAV swarm is reasonable and cost-effective. Moreover, services such as disaster evaluation and live broadcasting require high-definition video streams, which undoubtedly need broad-band wireless transmission. To achieve this goal, the mmWave approach is introduced in the UAV swarm. However, wireless backhaul links, the mobility of UAVs and system coexistence hamper performance. In this article, we propose a novel spectrum management (SM) architecture for UAV-assisted cellular networks. Considering the special feature of mmWave, we also study SM techniques for opportunistic utilization of low-altitude UAV swarm using multi-mode radio access technologies (RATs). Both motivations and challenges of the proposed SM architecture for the UAV swarm are analyzed. To evaluate the performances of the proposed mmWave based wireless backhaul in UAV-assisted cellular networks, different SM schemes have been discussed and verified with numerical results in five typical scenarios.",

   "abstract": "The next generation of cellular networks will exploit mmWave frequencies to dramatically increase the network capacity. Communication at such high frequencies, however, requires directionality to compensate the increased propagation loss. Users and base stations need to align their beams during both initial access and data transmissions to ensure that the maximum gain is reached. The accuracy of beam selection, and the delay in updating the beam pair or performing initial access, impact the end-to-end performance and the quality of service. In this article we review the beam management procedures included in the 3GPP NR specifications and propose possible enhancements, based on both standalone and non-standalone architectures, to improve network control operations. We also provide a performance comparison among different schemes, along with design insights on the most important parameters related to beam management frameworks.",

   "abstract": "ML has been increasingly adopted in wireless communications, with popular techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, applied to traffic classification, channel encoding/ decoding, and cognitive radio. This article discusses a different class of ML technique, stochastic online learning, and its promising applications to MEC. Based on stochastic gradient descent, stochastic online learning learns from the changes of dynamic systems (i.e., the gradient of the Lagrange multipliers) rather than training data, decouples tasks between time slots and edge devices, and asymptotically minimizes the time-averaged operational cost of MEC in a fully distributed fashion with the increase of the learning time. By taking the widely adopted big data analytic framework MapReduce as an example, numerical studies show that the network throughput can increase by eight times through adopting stochastic online learning as compared to existing offline implementations.",

   "abstract": "Future connected and automated driving applications can require larger bandwidth and higher data rates than currently supported by sub-6GHz V2X technologies (e.g., DSRC, ITS-G5 or C-V2X). This has triggered interest in developing mmWave vehicular communications. However, solutions are necessary to solve the challenges resulting from the use of high-frequency bands and the high mobility of vehicles. This article contributes to this active research area by proposing a sub- 6GHz assisted mmWave MAC that decouples the mmWave data and control planes. The proposal offloads mmWave MAC control functions to a sub-6GHz V2X technology. This approach improves the operation of the MAC as the control functions benefit from the longer range, and the broadcast and omnidirectional transmissions of sub-6GHz V2X technologies. This study demonstrates that the proposed sub-6GHz assisted mmWave MAC reduces the control overhead and delay, and increases the spatial sharing compared to mmWave communications using a configuration of IEEE 802.11ad tailored to vehicular networks. The proposed MAC is here evaluated for V2V communications using 802.11p for the control plane and 802.11ad for the data plane, although it can be adapted to other technologies such as C-V2X and 5G NR-V2X.",

   "abstract": "The ubiquitous connectivity between the things in a supply chain ecosystem will contribute to the information flow essential for establishing smart solutions for efficient, reliable, and intelligent supply chain operations. In this article, a new model integrating supply chain and IoT, referred to as SCoT, is proposed to evolve into SSCE and thus enhance supply chain productivity. Productivity in this article considers not only the rate of product output but also product quality and the rate of new product development. First, the ubiquitous and ultra-reliable connectivity necessary for connecting all things in SCoT is newly defined. Four fundamental applications in SSCE are identified, and four related use cases are discussed. Seamless information access in the fully connected SCoT network will facilitate supply chain management. A novel universal SCoT platform is thus proposed to perform intelligent operations on quality measurement, product integration, and decision making. Hitherto, there is no universal standard that quantitatively grades all Supply Chain of Things with a single indicator. To ensure the platform's objectiveness and consistency, an emerging IoT standard of IEEE P2668, namely IDex, is incorporated into the platform. IDex provides quantitative measurement, grading, and ranking of all IoT things. In addition, IDex also benefits the platform by contributing three extra functions to advise on a solution for quality improvement, integration guidance, and performance prediction. Ultimately, SCoT will proliferate five key impacts on automated quality control, efficient integration, smart transportation, intelligent decision making, and end-to-end traceability. Finally, three key future research directions in the implementation of SCoT are discussed.",

These enhancements are driven by the 25 use cases identified for V2X by the Third Generation Partnership Project, which are categorized as vehicle platooning, extended sensors, advanced driving, and remote driving. In this article, we provide an overview of the new V2X features supported by Rel-15 LTE systems, including carrier aggregation, higher-order modulation, low latency support, and new resource management solutions. We also discuss the possible next steps of the 3GPP V2X technology evolution in the upcoming releases.",

   "abstract": "With the completion of Release 15 of the 5G standard in early 2018, 2019 has become the first year for the commercialization of 5G. At this stage, it is too early to speculate what key technologies will mark 6G, since it is not known what the drivers for 6G might even be. However, the next generation system typically does not emerge from a vacuum. By examining the industrial and technological trends from previous generations, directions and trajectories associated with each new generation can be discovered. In this article, we shall provide observations regarding these trends and their potential for later releases of 5G and 6G. The goal of this article is to shed light on possible directions of 6G to help researchers jumpstart projects in this field while searching for new directions and breakthroughs.",

   "abstract": "Recently, street furniture, including bins, seats, and bus shelters, has become smart as it has been equipped with environmental sensors, wireless modules, processors, and microcontrollers. Accordingly, smart furniture is expected to become a vital part of the IoT infrastructure and one of the drivers of future smart cities. This work focuses on how smart street furniture can be exploited within the IoT architecture as a basis of recommender systems, toward achieving smart cities' different components. We present and discuss recent relevant work as well as the key challenges and opportunities for future research. We explain that much work is still required when it comes to combining scalability, real-time processing, smart furniture, and recommender systems.",

   "abstract": "Quantum computers will change the cryptographic panorama. A technology once believed to lie far away in the future is increasingly closer to real-world applications. Quantum computers will break the algorithms used in our public key infrastructure and in our key exchange protocols, forcing a complete retooling of cryptography as we know it. Quantum key distribution is a physical layer technology immune to quantum or classical computational threats. However, it requires a physical substrate, and optical fiber has been the usual choice. Most of the time, it is used just as a point-to-point link for the exclusive transport of delicate quantum signals. Its integration in a realworld shared network has not been attempted so far. Here we show how the new programmable software network architectures, together with specially designed quantum systems, can be used to produce a network that integrates classical and quantum communications, including management, in a single, production-level infrastructure. The network can also incorporate new quantum- safe algorithms and use the existing security protocols, thus bridging the gap between today's network security and the quantum-safe network of the future. This can be done in an evolutionary way, without zero-day migrations and the corresponding upfront costs. We also present how the technologies have been deployed in practice using a production network.",

Arguably, infallible C&amp;C channels for safe and autonomous flying, and high-throughput links for multi-purpose live video streaming. And indeed, meeting these aspirations may entail full cellular support, provided through 5G-and-beyond hardware and software upgrades by both mobile operators and manufacturers of these UAVs. In this article, we vouch for massive MIMO as the key building block to realize 5G-connected UAVs. Through the sheer evidence of 3GPP-compliant simulations, we demonstrate how massive MIMO can be enhanced by complementary network-based and UAV-based solutions, resulting in consistent UAV C&amp;C support, large UAV uplink data rates, and harmonious coexistence with legacy ground users.",

While 5G is being deployed around the world, efforts from industry and academia have started to look beyond 5G and conceptualize 6G. We envision 6G to undergo an unprecedented transformation that will make it substantially different from the previous generations of wireless cellular systems. In particular, 6G will go beyond mobile Internet and will be required to support ubiquitous AI services from the core to the end devices of the network. Meanwhile, AI will play a critical role in designing and optimizing 6G architectures, protocols, and operations. In this article, we discuss potential technologies for 6G to enable mobile AI applications, as well as AI-enabled methodologies for 6G network design and optimization. Key trends in the evolution to 6G will also be discussed.",

   "abstract": "This article defines a four-layer architectural stack called the ToIP stack for establishing trust between peers over the Internet and other digital networks. Patterned after the TCP/IP stack that standardized packet exchange and created the Internet, the ToIP stack is a decentralized architecture that encompasses business, legal, and technological requirements. Layer One establishes decentralized trust roots using decentralized identifiers (DIDs), an emerging W3C standard for decentralized PKI. Layer Two is the DIDComm protocol, a transport-independent protocol that uses DIDs to form and communicate over a cryptographically secure connection. Layer Three is a suite of credential exchange protocols based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard for cryptographically verifiable digital credentials. Layer Four adds cryptographically verifiable governance frameworks using a metamodel for describing the business, legal, and technical policies under which a peer is operating as an issuer, holder, or verifier of digital credentials. This governance metamodel can be applied at all four Layers of the stack, producing a parallel ToIP Governance Stack that fully integrates the non-technical dimensions of trust establishment. Further work on defining, testing, and integrating the ToIP stack is planned for a new project at the Linux Foundation.",

   "abstract": "Extending an Internet subnet by connecting resource-constrained nodes (e.g., embedded sensors and actuators) over multiple wireless hops is necessary to support the future Internet of Things (IoT). RPL, the IPv6 routing standard for low-power and lossy networks, tried to achieve this goal but has not seen wide adoption in practice. As an alternative, Thread is a recently standardized low-power network protocol for IoT, driven by the Thread group, an industry consortium led by Google/Nest. We provide a comparative analysis of the technical aspects of RPL and Thread based on their specifications, explaining why using Thread, as opposed to RPL, may make sense for the future Internet. Specifically, the fundamental differences between RPL and Thread are their respective scopes and multihop network architectures, which result in Thread's unique design and advantages over RPL. Lastly, we evaluate Thread in an indoor multihop wireless testbed using OpenThread, an official open source implementation of Thread. This work serves as the first analysis of the Thread protocol in academia.",

In 5G-based cMTC, enabling time synchronization in the wireless edge means moving beyond the current synchronization needs and solutions in 5G radio access. In this article, we analyze the device-level synchronization needs of potential cMTC applications: industrial automation, power distribution, vehicular communication, and live audio/video production. We present an overthe- air synchronization scheme comprising 5G air interface parameters and discuss their associated timing errors. We evaluate the estimation error in device-to-base-station propagation delay from timing advance under random errors and show how to reduce the estimation error. In the end, we identify the random errors specific to dense multipath fading environments and discuss countermeasures.",

   "abstract": "Current SDN controllers have been designed based on a monolithic approach that integrates all services and applications into one single, huge program. The monolithic design of SDN controllers restricts programmers who build management applications to the specific programming interfaces and services that a given SDN controller provides, making application development dependent on the controller, and thereby restricting portability of management applications across controllers. Furthermore, the monolithic approach means an SDN controller must be recompiled whenever a change is made, and does not provide an easy way to add new functionality or scale to handle large networks. To overcome the weaknesses inherent in the monolithic approach, the next generation of SDN controllers must use a distributed, microservice architecture that disaggregates the control plane by dividing the monolithic controller into a set of cooperative microservices. In this article, we explain the steps that are required to migrate from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture, and consider two potential designs that achieve the goal. Finally, the article reports the results of testbed measurements that we use to evaluate the proposed disaggregated architecture from multiple perspectives, including functionality and performance.",

   "abstract": "Contemporary resource constraint mobile devices face great challenges to execute computationally expensive tasks of low-latency Tactile Internet applications in a time-efficient manner. The so-called HART has emerged as a promising platform to address the burden of resource-limited mobile devices by allowing collaboration among humans, cloud agents, and robots for task execution. To facilitate a better task execution performance, dynamic task offloading onto suitable actors represents an important research problem, taking time-varying task, robot, and cloud agent properties into account. To tackle this open problem, this article first discusses characteristics, applications, and challenges of HART tasks. Next, this article investigates the problem of whether and where a HART task should be offloaded and presents a COTA strategy by taking task offloading gain and communication overhead into account. For HART-centric task offloading, this article leverages central cloud, mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, and multi-robot FiWi networks. Finally, numerical results are presented to examine the performance of the proposed COTA scheme over FiWi based Tactile Internet infrastructures.",

   "abstract": "In today's wireless data market, the growing data demand and more severe market competition force mobile network operators (MNOs) to offer more flexible wireless data services. Many MNOs are experimenting with novel data mechanisms generalizing the traditional three-part tariff data plan involving a fixed data cap. The generalization is often in terms of providing additional flexibility in terms of time, user, and location. The rollover mechanism, allowing the unused data in the current month to be consumed in a future month, is a time-flexible data mechanism. As an illustrative example, we focus on studying the economics and optimizations of wireless data plans with time flexibility. We consider a framework that incorporates various time-flexible data plans (as well as the non-flexible benchmark). We characterize the degree of flexibility of different plans, and investigate the economic impact of time flexibility on both users' payoffs and MNOs' profits. We incorporate various factors in our study, such as the adoption of multiple data caps and market competition. We also discuss how time flexibility can interact with user flexibility. Finally, we outline some open problems that deserve future work from the community.",

   "abstract": "MCS is an emerging paradigm that leverages the pervasiveness of mobile, wearable, and vehicle-mounted devices to collect data from urban environments for ubiquitous service provisioning. In order to manage MCS application data streams efficiently, a scalable computing infrastructure hosting heterogeneous and distributed resources is critical. FC, as a geo-distributed computing paradigm, is a key enabler for this requirement as it bridges cloud servers and smart mobile devices. Research on the integration of MCS with FC has recently started to be explored, recognizing the requirements of MCS and their coexistence with cyber-physical systems. In this article, we analyze the state of the art of FC solutions in MCS systems. After a brief overview of MCS, we emphasize the link between MCS and FC. We then investigate the existing fog-based MCS architectures in detail by focusing on their building blocks, as well as the challenges that remain unaddressed. Our detailed review on the subject results in a taxonomy of FC solutions in MCS systems. In particular, we highlight the node structures, the information exchanged, the resource and service management, and the type of solutions adopted concerning privacy and security. Moreover, we provide a thorough discussion on the open issues and challenges by reporting useful insights for researchers in MCS and FC.",

   "abstract": "With the ongoing worldwide development of IoT, an unprecedented number of IoT devices imperatively consume a substantial amount of energy. IoT devices have been predicted to be the leading energy guzzler in Information and Communications Technology by 2020. In considering the finite amount of brown energy sources along with their potential harmful impacts to the climate and environment, we propose to leverage \"free\" green energy to power IoT devices and revolutionarily enable wireless charging of these devices. Specifically, we propose to green IoT in three steps, namely, ambient green energy harvesting, green energy wireless charging and green energy balancing, in which the latter step reinforces the former step to ensure the availability of green energy. We lay out the basic design principles for these three steps, shed some light on the solutions and present the corresponding challenges individually.",

Therefore, future wireless networks need to support real-time control since it is the essential function enabling such emerging applications. In this article, some fundamental design capabilities needed to realize real-time control in future wireless networks are discussed, with primary emphasis given to communication- control because both communication and control systems have strong dynamics and interdependencies, and they tightly interact with each other. A case study is provided to demonstrate the necessity of such co-design.",

   "abstract": "Understanding crowd mobility behaviors would be a key enabler for crowd management in smart cities, benefiting various sectors such as public safety, tourism and transportation. This article discusses the existing challenges and the recent advances to overcome them and allow sharing information across stakeholders of crowd management through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The article proposes the usage of the new federated interoperable semantic IoT platform (FIESTA-IoT), which is considered as \"a system of systems.\" The platform can support various IoT applications for crowd management in smart cities. In particular, the article discusses two integrated IoT systems for crowd mobility: the Crowd Mobility Analytics System and the Crowd Counting and Location System (from the SmartSantander testbed). Pilot studies are conducted in the Gold Coast, Australia, and Santander, Spain, to fulfill various requirements such as providing online and offline crowd mobility analyses with various sensors in different regions. The analyses provided by these systems are shared across applications in order to provide insights and support crowd management in smart city environments.",

   "abstract": "Deep learning continues to offer groundbreaking technologies in communications systems just as it has in a variety of other fields. Despite the notable advancements of technologies based on DNN-based technologies in recent years, their high computational complexity has been a major obstacle to the application of DNN in practical communications systems where real-time operation is required. In this sense, challenges regarding its practical implementation must be addressed before the proliferation of DNN-based intelligent communications becomes a reality. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present article is the first to present an efficient learning architecture and related design strategies including link-level verification through the implementation of digital circuits using hardware description language (HDL) to mitigate this challenge and to deduce the feasibility and potential of DNNs in communications systems. In particular, a DNN is applied to an encoder and a decoder to enable flexible adaptation with respect to their system environments, without the need for any domain-specific information. Extensive investigations and interdisciplinary design considerations, including a DNNbased autoencoder structure, learning framework, and implementation of a low-complexity digital circuit for real-time operation, are taken into account, all of which support the use of DNNbased communications in practice.",

   "abstract": "The dramatic increase in Internet traffic to and from wireless devices poses significant challenges for network operators. While the current growth of traffic is mostly due to consumers communicating more frequently and larger amounts of data over the wireless infrastructure, much of the future growth is predicted to originate from non-human-operated devices or so-called IoT communication. The 3GPP standardization activities toward 5G cellular systems envisages two IoT-centric scenarios: mMTC and URLLC. In this article, we quantify the advantages of grant-free operation for 5G mMTC using latency, signaling overhead, and power consumption aspects. We propose the high-level design of a new grant-free state of operation and explain its interaction with the legacy LTE operating states. We also describe promising grantfree NOMA solutions with respect to synchronization and HARQ, and resource collision handling procedures. Our discussion and proposal relate closely to the current 5G standardization activities in 3GPP and highlight solutions that can easily be integrated into the current LTE framework.",

   "abstract": "Quantifying the benefits of content cache deployments, both in terms of latency and path lengths, and identifying the disparity of achievable benefits over IPv6 and over IPv4, is essential to identify bottlenecks in content delivery. We approached this matter by collecting and analyzing traceroute measurements toward YouTube from ~100 vantage points located in 74 different origin autonomous systems (ASs). Using a longitudinal dataset (05/2016-05/2018), we show that most of the Google Global Cache (GGC) nodes were reachable within ~6 IP hops and within ~20 ms from users streaming the videos. Further, we observed that in cases where GGC nodes were dual-stacked, the path lengths and latencies were comparable over both address families. However, as generally believed, shorter path lengths did not always correlate with lower latency: when the video was cached by a GGC node over IPv6 only, paths were almost always shorter over IPv6. Yet, latencies were still lower over IPv4, indicating room for improvement over IPv6. GGCs reduced IP path lengths and latencies by up to a third over IPv4 and by up to a half over IPv6, stressing the importance of content cache deployments in ISP networks. To encourage reproducibility of this work, we make the entire dataset available to the community.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communication has been a fundamental part of railway operation, control, and service systems for decades. In the era of 5G and beyond, the railway communication system is evolving from critical signaling to support various functions to improve the convenience, efficiency, and safety of railway services. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands and related technologies are the keys to this vision. Therefore, the characterization, modeling, and simulation of mmWave channels are critical for the design and performance evaluation, as well as for the construction of the future railway infrastructures. In this article, a brief overview of the architecture design of a train-to-infrastructure (T2I) mmWave communication system is provided. Based on investigating the existing research and related work on T2I mmWave channels, the challenges and requirements are identified, and the appropriate research paradigm and future directions in this area are discussed.",

   "abstract": "We study the potential of using sensor networks as distributed antenna arrays for improved packet reception performance. In many sensor network applications, nodes can be distinguished according to their roles. Backbone (or ground) nodes establish a core network used to deliver data to a (possibly central) sink, whereas mobile nodes transmit sensor readings to this backbone. In the case of errors, the transmitted information is either lost or must be repeated. Considering very energy constrained nodes, such retransmission is often prohibitive. Making use of the spatial distribution of such a ground network means that macrodiversity can be exploited. By combining received signal samples from multiple ground stations, the chance of successful decoding can be substantially improved. Using a specific wildlife monitoring application, we demonstrate the advantages of this concept. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of a sensor network as a distributed antenna array, which offers many possibilities in upcoming Internet of Things applications.",

   "abstract": "UAVs can play an important role in next generation cellular networks, acting as flying infrastructure that can serve ground users when regular infrastructure is overloaded or unavailable. As these devices operate wirelessly, they rely on an internal battery for their power supply, which limits the amount of time they can operate over an area of interest before having to recharge. To accommodate this limitation, UAV networks will have to rely on dedicated infrastructure to recharge the UAV in between deployments. In this article, we outline three battery charging options that may be considered by a network operator and use simulations to demonstrate the performance impact of incorporating those options into a cellular network where UAV infrastructure provides wireless service.",

For battery-powered low-cost IoT devices, wake-up radio (WuR) appears as an eminent technique for prolonging the lifetime of such devices, thanks to its outstanding energy consumption performance. However, only some small-size battery-powered IoT devices are able to transmit to a cellular IoT base station (BS) directly. In this article, we present W2B-IoT, a prototype implementation of a WuR-based twotier system, which bridges cellular IoT BS and WuR via a Bluetooth low energy (BLE)-enabled Android smartphone. Such a WuR-enabled IoT device features a current consumption of merely 390 nA and a response time of 95 ms for decoding a wake-up call.",

At the same time, telecommunication service providers began exploring container technologies in search of better performance results. However, the use of containers for network functions virtualization purposes entails a number of limitations, such as security and isolation problems resulting from the use of a shared kernel. This article introduces unikernel network functions as the next step toward network functions softwarization. The use of unikernels enables the implementation of network functions in the form of lightweight images that can run either on a hypervisor or directly on the hardware layer. It is shown that unikernel network functions achieve comparable performance results to those based on containers, while providing a significantly higher security level.",

   "abstract": "Enabling vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, and everything for use cases such as road safety, automatic driving, and infotainment is important for the future cellular networks. However, some vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services need secure transmissions and should be prevented from eavesdropping. Physical layer security, an information- theoretical framework, utilizes the randomness of underlying channels to ensure secrecy in the physical layer. Different from ground communications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) create line-of-sight connections to vehicles and mobile users making them an ideal platform to conduct physical layer security strategies. In this article, we embrace UAV to V2X communications to enhance the V2X security from the physical layer security's perspective. To be specific, we present security problems in V2X systems, highlight security threats in V2X networks, and illustrate some potential applications of UAVs in V2X security. Open problems for UAV-assisted V2X secure communications are also discussed.",

   "abstract": "In 2005, IPv6 over Low Power WPAN (6LoWPAN), the first Working Group (WG) on the Internet of Things (IoT), was established in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to standardize mechanisms to transmit IPv6 datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4 technology. Since IPv6 may contain datagram sizes much larger than the IEEE 802.15.4 maximum frame size, a new adaptation layer was specified by standardizing several documents such RFC 4944, RFC 6282, and RFC 6775 in the 6LoWPAN WG. In 2007, RFC 4944 was published, and it defines the frame format for transmission of IPv6 datagrams. Moreover, it specifies techniques for header compression, fragmentation, and reassembly, and two fragment forwarding modes, \"mesh under\" and \"route over.\" In 2012, RFC 6282 was published to update RFC 4944; however, it does not update the fragment forwarding mechanism. Indeed, an IPv6 datagram larger than 1000 bytes could be fragmented to 10 fragments when considering IEEE 802.15.4 technology that comes with a maximum transmission unit of 127 bytes. Furthermore, under the 6LoWPAN route-over mode, the fragmented 6LoWPAN datagram must be reassembled and fragmented again at every hop, which will negatively affect the network reliability and latency. In this article, we first introduce the main operations of RFC 4944, and then we present the potential fragment forwarding issues when the route over mode is employed. We then give an overview of the ongoing proposed works at the IETF to solve the undesired issues of RFC 4944.",

However, the ease of copying digital files and sharing cryptographic keys makes an old problem from physical credential space more pressing: How do we prevent a credential from being used by someone other than its legitimate holder? Biometrics provide an answer - but they also introduce some complexity as well as trust and privacy concerns that need careful treatment. In this article, we explore three patterns of biometric use with verifiable credentials, identify appropriate use cases for each, and recommend best practices that make the patterns trustworthy, robust, and interoperable.",

Relocation policies for applications in the MEC environment are necessary to guarantee its effectiveness and performance, and can use a multitude of different data (user position and direction, availability of MEC services and computation resources, etc.). In this article, we advocate using deep reinforcement learning to relocate applications in MEC scenarios, by having MEC learn during the evolution of the system. We show the feasibility of this approach and highlight its benefits via simulation, also presenting an environment that can foster future research on this topic.",

Several powerful concepts have emerged to facilitate this vision, whether involving the human context whenever required or directly impacting user behavior and decisions. As these become the stepping stones to develop the IoT into a novel people-centric utility, this article outlines a path to realize this decisive transformation. We begin by reviewing the latest progress in human-aware wireless networking, then classify the attractive human-machine applications and summarize the enabling IoT radio technologies. We continue with a unique system-level performance characterization of a representative urban IoT scenario and quantify the benefits of keeping people in the loop on various levels. Our comprehensive numerical results confirm the significant gains that have been made available with tighter user involvement, and also corroborate the development of efficient incentivization mechanisms, thereby opening the door to future commoditization of the global people-centric IoT utility.",

   "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has now become an effective paradigm to collect massive data for various sensing applications. However, the interactions between mobile users and the platform, and the data release to third parties, pose severe challenges of privacy leakage for MCS systems, such as the leakage of users' identities and locations. Although several works on MCS have explored the privacy issues in task allocation, incentive, and data reporting, there is still a lack of a comprehensive privacy preserving framework for MCS to protect the privacy of users throughout users' involvement in crowdsensing tasks. In this article, we divide the life cycle of each crowdsensing task in MCS into four phases: task allocation, incentive, data collection, and data publishing, and design a privacy-preserving framework for MCS to protect users' privacy in the whole life cycle of MCS.",

   "abstract": "The vast available spectrum in the millimeter- wave (mmWave) bands offers the possibility of multi-gigabit-per-second data rates for fifth generation cellular networks. However, mmWave capacity can be highly intermittent due to the vulnerability of mmWave signals to blockages and delays in directional searching. Such highly variable links present unique challenges for adaptive control mechanisms in transport layer protocols and end-to-end applications. This article considers the fundamental question of whether TCP, the most widely used transport protocol, will work in mmWave cellular systems. The article provides a comprehensive simulation study of TCP considering various factors such as the congestion control algorithm, including the recently proposed TCP BBR, edge vs. remote servers, handover and multi-connectivity, TCP packet size, and 3GPPstack parameters. We show that the performance of TCP on mmWave links is highly dependent on different combinations of these parameters, and identify the open challenges in this area.",

   "abstract": "TCMS is a key element for smart railway operation and maintenance. In order to reduce costs and train weight, EU-funded projects are working on the development of wireless TCMS. The data exchanges between trains and ground will be based on wireless technology such as WiFi or Long Term Evolution. First prototypes are available at the European level. To facilitate the testing of the TCMS interface to ground systems, it is important to develop tools able to represent railway environments without going on tracks (zero on-site testing). In this context, we present two strategies to simulate and emulate a complete wireless network (including the core network), based on the Riverbed Modeler and OpenAirInterface platform, able to take into account various train-to-ground contexts (environment, communication and railway networks load). This work considers LTE technology but can be transposed to other types of technology if representative system models are available. As a proof of concept of the test environment, we present results in terms of delay and delivery rates considering TCMS traffic and various railway scenarios such as train speed and wireless network load.",

   "abstract": "Zero-knowledge schemes have recently become a popular attempt to offer users privacy in an attribute-based credential system. In this article, we do not contest the mathematics of these schemes; we assume it is logically sound. Instead, we draw attention to the trade-off that is made when employing cryptography instead of trusted parties to protect user privacy. We assert that, for these approaches to create the trust required by credential verifiers, they must introduce mechanisms that limit their utility and create significant privacy risk to the user that cuts against data minimization goals. Greater trust must be placed in the shelf life of cryptography to prevent the user from being unwantonly correlated than alternative approaches. Just as we would discourage storing encrypted private data on public blockchains, we discourage this approach here. Lastly, this article introduces the concept of a trusted witness which provides privacy for honest users and solves the privacy-trust problem without the disadvantages of the zero-knowledge approach.",

Then, starting from practical handset form factor constraints and system-level drivers, CMOS-specific technological and design-related challenges are conceptually illustrated using a simple single-transistor PA. A survey of the state-ofthe- art is presented to give examples of the challenges and illustrate the PA techniques used to tackle them in linear 28-GHz CMOS PAs for 5G NR.",
