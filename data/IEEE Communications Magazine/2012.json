Polarization- division multiplexed quadrature phase shift keying with digital coherent detection, and fast recovery in optical channel rerouting are key technologies for 100-Gb/s long-haul systems and beyond. We review test results of a realtime 80-channel wavelength-division multiplexing transmission over 420 km of field-installed fiber. Finally, we focus on digital nonlinear compensation and pilot tone phase noise compensation as technologies for systems beyond 100 Gb/s.",

      "abstract": "Since its inception in the early '70s, Ethernet has gradually displaced other popular standards, such as token-ring, while becoming the de facto standard for local area networks in the enterprise office and data center environments. During Ethernet's lifetime, data rates have increased from the original 10 Mb/s to 10 Gb/s. Now, 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s standards have been defined, ushering in the next generation of equipment and components. This article presents the challenges of designing 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet host board channels that are targeted for data center applications. The data center infrastructure comprises: a short-reach optical multimode fiber of length 100 m or less; and/or a copper twinax shielded cable of length 7 m or less, to interconnect collocated communication equipment racks. The recently published 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet standard specifies the copper interfaces (CR4/CR10) and the short-reach optical nonretimed optical interfaces (SR4/SR10). This article reviews the Ethernet copper and fiber short-reach application compliance test techniques, and identifies common specifications and areas of divergence for both applications. Cable specifications and its insertion loss budget are also reviewed, providing conclusions that will aid the communications equipment and components manufacturer with a clear reference to address the design and implementation of a standards-compliant product.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, wireless networks are largely deployed, and the number of smart phones has boomed, as well as data transfer via mobile phones. This has resulted in the emergence of multihoming, which allows the user to enjoy the best access for each application. The context of our work is mobile multihomed terminals in a heterogeneous environment. We propose a solution for interdomain mobility management with end-to-end service continuity of communication. For this purpose, we combine a multihoming protocol (SHIM6), which ensures a seamless network change, with the IMS architecture, which allows the establishment of multimedia sessions with quality of service. Our proposal enables a mobile terminal to change its access network seamlessly, without any application disruption. To achieve this, we implement a P-SIP inside the terminal to manage the signaling procedures. The proposed scheme can manage the interdomain mobility of a terminal in two modes: reactive and proactive. A testbed allows us to show the feasibility of our approach and the obtained gain by reducing considerably the handover delay and thus, the data loss.",

We present a motivational exercise gaming system whose goal is to increase the activity of elders with complex chronic conditions. Our gaming system, initially deployed unattended, showed discouraging results. Our second attempt addresses these shortcomings by coupling the gaming console with an application for presenting exercise results to remote clinicians and caregivers, and a smartphone- based application for collecting feedback and issuing alerts. HealthOS, a platform for developing healthcare applications, integrates all components of the applications.",

      "abstract": "Running desktop-as-a-service solutions in remote data centers is an emerging means of delivering virtual PCs in an inexpensive, secure, and easy-to-maintain way. The fact that such solutions rely on the presence of connectivity between users and their virtual PCs poses a challenging operational question: what is the quality of experience of the user when running a particular application inside the thin-client protocol? The challenge is to understand whether the path between the client and the server has enough resources to sustain the rendering of the specific application. To address this question, we propose a method that exploits statistical classification to infer on-the-fly the class of applications running inside a given thin-client connection. We then correlate such information with the key factor that limits thin-client performance (i.e., network latency) to obtain the current user's QoE. We evaluate how machine-learning techniques can robustly detect applications that exchange data over the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, with promising results (over 80 percent of accuracy for multimedia content). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of using statistical techniques to monitor thin-client applications for QoE detection.",

      "abstract": "As line interfaces in communications chassis transition to 100 Gb/s and higher per port, many in the industry question when electrical backplanes inside these chassis will give way to optical ones. Provided that the maximum card-to-card distance over a backplane remains at one meter, two observations point to an electrical-to-optical transition near the end of this decade: commercial links transition from electrical to optical at the bandwidth-distance product of 100 Gb/s .m [1], and backplane line rates double every two process nodes and will reach 100 Gb/s in four process nodes. But optical solutions will need to overcome incumbency, or economics will call for electrical backplane solutions. To set up a framework for comparing backplane solutions, this article first defines a canonical backplane model to enumerate possible backplane implementations. Using this model, this article identifies 10 practical future backplane implementations, of which four are electrical and six optical. This article further describes how electrical solutions could be viable beyond this decade. It then outlines three necessary conditions for optical solutions to unseat the incumbent. Finally, it argues that optical solutions have an inherent advantage to scale systems with inter-chassis links, an advantage that could tip the balance in favor of optics in future backplanes.",

      "abstract": "The environments in which current electric grids operate as well as the requirements for the emerging smart grid differ substantially from those of today's Internet and telecommunication networks. For example, typical electric or gas meters in the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) are low-power, low-capability wireless devices utilizing personal area wireless network technology (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4). These devices are low-cost, typically with 4-12 kbytes of RAM and 64-256 kbytes of flash memory, and are often connected to the backhaul via low-bandwidth links. Comparing this to the high-powered, high-capability devices of the Internet with gigabytes of RAM and storage, the differences are striking. Security solutions designed for capability-rich Internet devices will not be suitable for the capability-poor devices of the smart grid; thus, new requirements are needed that can efficiently operate in resource constrained devices. With this operating environment in mind, we present a smart grid key management framework with application to AMI networks. Specifically, we describe how this key management model can be realized in such a resource-constrained environment using existing standard protocols and provide preliminary performance results.",

One of the key constituents of the smart grid is the automated metering infrastructure, which is expected to facilitate the transport of meter readings from meters to the utility provider, and (potentially) control information in the other direction. A range of communication technologies are being considered for realizing AMI networks with no clear winner so far. This article provides an overview of some of the candidate solutions and proposes a mesh-radio based solution. The proposed solution is an enhanced version of the RPL protocol and exhibits self-organizing characteristics, and is practical and therefore attractive from a deployment perspective.

As cost-effective alternatives to fibre backhauls, high speed microwave backhauls provide a number of significant benefits, especially for bringing broadband services to rural and regional areas. This article addresses the challenges to wireless backhauls and presents a multi-gigabit microwave backhaul system, called Ngara backhaul, which is being developed at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia. The various innovative aspects of the Ngara backhaul system including spectrum aggregation, peak-toaverage power ratio reduction, out-of-band emission cancellation, and sample rate conversion, are reported.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing changes in the way we use the Internet are motivating the definition of new information-distributing designs for an interworking layer. Recently, information-centric networking (ICN) concepts have defined mechanisms focusing on which information to get rather than where it is located. However, the still unfledged architectures instantiating such concepts have disregarded vital operations, such as management aspects aiming to optimize content retrieval by the User Equipment (UE). In this article, a flexible management framework is proposed, which enhances existing Named Data Networking (NDN) architectures in allowing both the network and the UE to employ management mechanisms over the NDN fabric. We illustrate our management framework with an implementation over an open-source NDN software, considering the specific case study of interface management. We quantitatively access the performance gains achieved through the usage of this framework in such scenarios, when compared to un-managed NDN mechanisms.",

However, some issues such as cross-domain interoperability and user-centricity are still unresolved. Therefore, this article proposes a semantic enhanced converged service exposure model that enables services derived from different domains (i.e., telecom/web/device/user) to be integrated into a composite service regardless of their underlying heterogeneities. Meanwhile, the user-centric feature is enhanced by applying the semantic annotation to both the service description and the user request, as well as empowering a user to publish and share his/her created service in a user-friendly way. Moreover, a variety of interfaces, including APIs, widgets, and natural-language-based tools, are provided to satisfy the multilevel user requirements, enabling users to profit from a highly personalized, meaningful communication and interaction experience.",

      "abstract": "The future digital home (DH) is envisioned as a place where a plethora of diverse personal and machine-to-machine communications will coexist to support different applications in areas such as information and entertainment, home automation, home health care and home security and management. Wireless technologies are usually the preferred solution to cope with DH communications for their ease of installation and use. However, expected capacity demand and the lack of coordination between an increasing number of diverse wireless devices in use within the DH is seriously challenging the performance and usability of wireless technologies. This article outlines a novel technical solution intended to enhance capacity and quality of DH wireless communications. The proposed solution establishes a radio-independent coexistence framework where key operational radio settings of DH devices are coordinately determined, and new spectrum sources other than traditional ISM bands can be exploited for DH communications. The addressed solution enables a business player to offer management services for DH wireless communications so that ordinary users can be relieved of complex management tasks likely to arise within the DH. The article discusses how potential management service providers could benefit from the proposed solution. Besides, the functional architecture of the proposed solution together with the set of procedures necessary for the management of the DH wireless communications are outlined. A realistic indoor scenario is presented as an illustrative use case to show how proper decision making logic in managing the DH could improve the efficiency by selecting the most suitable spectrum for in-house wireless communications. Finally, the main implementation issues are identified and discussed in order to outline a feasible roadmap",

The approach leverages in-network caching, multiparty communication through replication, and interaction models decoupling senders and receivers. The goal is to provide a network infrastructure service that is better suited to today\u00bfs use (in particular. content distribution and mobility) and more resilient to disruptions and failures. The ICN approach is being explored by a number of research projects. We compare and discuss design choices and features of proposed ICN architectures, focusing on the following main components: named data objects, naming and security, API, routing and transport, and caching. We also discuss the advantages of the ICN approach in general.",

From the ICN perspective, contents are first class network citizens instead of hosts. ICN's primary objective is to shift the current host-oriented communication model toward a content-centric model for effective distribution of content over the network. In recent years this paradigm shift has generated much interest in the research community and sprung several research projects around the globe to investigate and advance this stream of thought. Content naming and content-based routing are core research challenges in this research community. In this survey, we analyze, compare, and contrast the naming and routing mechanisms proposed by some of the most prominent ICN research projects.",

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks will be Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), as they will comprise multiple Radio Access Technologies (RAT) and network architectures. The complexity of managing and operating such networks is forcing operators to find new strategies if they want to remain competitive. In this context, Self-Organizing Networks (SON) have arisen as one of the key technologies for enhancing operation and minimizing costs in future networks. SON functionalities can be classified as self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. Although the first two categories have received considerable attention in the last years, the studies devoted to self-healing have been scarce. In addition, existing references use different terminology and concepts and they focus only on partial aspects of self-healing for a particular RAT. This article unifies previous research and proposes a reference model for self-healing in which terms and functions are unambiguously defined. In addition, this article presents a survey on the state of the art, in which the main references on self-healing are outlined. Finally, the main research challenges in self-healing that will have to be faced in the near future are summarized.",

In this work, a wearable ECG sensor is proposed. This sensor system combined an appropriate wireless protocol for data communication with capacitive ECG signal sensing and processing. The ANT protocol was used as a low-data-rate wireless module to reduce the power consumption and size of the sensor. Furthermore, capacitive ECG sensing is a simple technique that avoids direct contact with the skin and provides maximum convenience to the user. In our work, small capacitive electrodes were integrated into a cotton T-shirt together with a signal processing and transmitting board on a two-layer standard printed circuit board design technology. The entire system has small size, is thin, and has low power consumption compared to recent ECG monitoring systems. In addition, appropriate signal conditioning and processing were implemented to remove motion artifacts. The acquired ECG signals are comparable to ones obtained using conventional glued-on electrodes, and are easily read and interpreted by a cardiologist.",

      "abstract": "Handling traffic dynamics in order to avoid network congestion and subsequent service disruptions is one of the key tasks performed by contemporary network management systems. Given the simple but rigid routing and forwarding functionalities in IP base environments, efficient resource management and control solutions against dynamic traffic conditions is still yet to be obtained. In this article, we introduce AMPLE - an efficient traffic engineering and management system that performs adaptive traffic control by using multiple virtualized routing topologies. The proposed system consists of two complementary components: offline link weight optimization that takes as input the physical network topology and tries to produce maximum routing path diversity across multiple virtual routing topologies for long term operation through the optimized setting of link weights. Based on these diverse paths, adaptive traffic control performs intelligent traffic splitting across individual routing topologies in reaction to the monitored network dynamics at short timescale. According to our evaluation with real network topologies and traffic traces, the proposed system is able to cope almost optimally with unpredicted traffic dynamics and, as such, it constitutes a new proposal for achieving better quality of service and overall network performance in IP networks.",

      "abstract": "The Metro Ethernet Forum, which is setting global carrier Ethernet standards, has recently announced a Carrier Ethernet Generations Framework. The Framework defines three carrier Ethernet generations: carrier Ethernet 1.0, carrier Ethernet 2.0, and Future. The Future generation focuses on achieving the goals of simplified management and automation of carrier Ethernet services (e.g., service configuration, activation, and monitoring). In addition to making the service operational, this includes on-demand and proactive performance monitoring for assessing the quality of the service; traffic management; and compliance with the service level agreement. This article proposes a more efficient and scalable performance measurement metrics collection architecture, using Internet Protocol Detail Record Streaming Protocol for the new generation back office. The goal is to move multiple service operators away from SNMP, with its known limitations, to a more compact and powerful standards-based streaming protocol and XML-based data modeling language. The intended audience for this article includes MSOs deploying a DPoE Network with devices, including DPoE Systems, converged cable access platforms, and DPoE optical network units, that implement service OAM PM and traffic management functionality based on MEF specifications. The audience also includes application and equipment suppliers who are developing back office metrics collection systems and DPoE/MEF equipment.",

      "abstract": "Experimental studies of wireless sensor networks have shown that asymmetry in low-power wireless links has a significant effect on the performance of WSN protocols. Protocols that work well in simulation studies often fail when link asymmetry is encountered in real-world deployments. Thus, characterization of asymmetry is of importance for the design of resilient WSN protocols that will work in practice. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, it identifies some of the hardware and physical factors that can contribute to link asymmetry, and gives an experimental assessment of their relative importance. Second, it examines the impact of packet length and interpacket interval on protocol operation, and identifies possible interactions that also cause asymmetrical behavior.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the radio system requirements and design trade-offs of a low-power 2.3/2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.6-narrowband transmitter for body area network applications. The IEEE 802.15.6 narrowband PHY adopts nonconstant envelope DPSK modulations. Transmitter architecture selection is a major challenge because it needs to provide both amplitude and phase modulation, with good efficiency and strict requirements on modulation accuracy and linearity for non-constant envelope modulations. A PLL-based polar transmitter with a Sigma-Delta digitally controlled power amplifier (\u03a3\u0394-DPA) is employed for its excellent energy efficiency. Finally, this article discusses the circuit design considerations and implementation results. With balance between analog and digital implementation, and careful planning of the radio system, the polar transmitter presented in this article can meet all of the specifications defined in IEEE 802.15.6 with abundant margin, while having extremely low power consumption of 5.4 mW and excellent energy efficiency of 5.4 nJ/bit.",

Cooperative communications fundamentally change the abstraction of a wireless link and offer significant potential advantages for wireless communication networks. This article visits cooperative techniques, such as relay, distributed antennas systems (DAS), multicell coordination, Group Cell, Coordinated Multiple Point transmission and reception (CoMP), those turn the traditional cellular system into a cooperative system. In particular, we propose several joint processing policies to demonstrate the Group Cell (CoMP) concept.

      "abstract": "Transmit antenna selection technology has been adopted for the uplink by the next generation Long Term Evolution wireless standard in order to harness the spatial diversity offered by multiple antennas at the mobile transmitter, while keeping the hardware complexity and cost of a mobile low. In TAS, the number of RF chains for processing/up-conversion is smaller than the number of available antenna elements, so at any time the signals can only be transmitted from a (dynamically optimized) subset of antenna elements. As a result, the training procedure for AS needs to be carefully engineered. In LTE, this is accomplished by reusing the wideband sounding reference signal for the purpose of AS training. Furthermore, new mechanisms are required to facilitate feedback from the receiver (the base station) to the transmitter about which subset is optimal and should thus be used by the mobile. In LTE, this is accomplished by employing a unique masking technique on the downlink control channel that eliminates the feedback overhead at the expense of a minor increase in complexity at the mobile. This article provides an in-depth and systematic overview of all physical and higher layer features in the LTE standard that enable TAS. Also highlighted are the variety of technical and standardization challenges that drove the specification of AS in LTE, and the aspects of the LTE standard that are impacted by AS.",

      "abstract": "Environmental problems, such as pollution, become more serious year after year. One of the major causes is high fossil fuel consumption with CO2 emission. In 2009, 23 percent of CO<sub>2</sub> emission globally came from land transportation systems, which is equal to 7000 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. This large amount of gas pollution should be reduced to slow down global environmental problems. Reduction of fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission in land transportation systems, which will have immediate positive economical and environmental impact, has become an important part of green technologies to alleviate global warming due to human activity. Intelligent transportation systems, which aim to use information and communication technology in the transportation systems, are considered to be a major enabler for the future green ITS. This article aims to provide a survey of the latest published applications based on vehicular communications as well as the envisaged technical challenges in this research area.",

We raise the question of whether these models and metrics remain meaningful in light of the advances that wireless systems have undergone over the last two decades. A number of weaknesses are pointed out, and ideas on possible fixes are put forth. Some of the identified weaknesses have to do with models that, over time, have become grossly inadequate. Other weaknesses have to do with changes in the operating conditions of wireless systems, and others with the coarse and asymptotic nature of some of the most popular performance metrics (\"diversity\" and \"multiplexing\").",

      "abstract": "Auction theory, as a subfield of economics, provides useful tools to model, analyze, and optimize radio resource management in cognitive radio environments. By using an auction, radio resources such as subchannel, time slot, and transmit power can be allocated among licensed and unlicensed users in the system, following market laws. Due to the flexibility of mechanism design, there are various auction mechanisms that have been applied to cognitive radio systems with different characteristics. In this article, we first provide an overview of the basics of general auctions. Then the motivations and specific design issues in applying auctions to wireless network architectures and protocols are discussed. Then we review the state of the art in the use of auction theory and mechanism design in cognitive radio networks. This will enable the readers to have a general view of auction fundamentals, as well as the recent development and applications of auction theory in the emerging cognitive wireless networks.",

      "abstract": "Connecting people is the ultimate goal of telecommunication. With advances in computing capability and ubiquitous access to various data, today's connection is focused on the blended information delivered by a converged mechanism, driven by the consumer\u00bfs thirst for digital social interaction. Leveraging technologies like data mining, service-indication texting, and synthesized imaging, next-generation applications are incorporating more information into our daily communication. More services hence emerge from this kind of data federation. This article explores potential service augmentation by placing communication in a four-dimensional model that combines service delivery and external data augmentation. Using categorized information obtained by data mining techniques, a specially designed service indication text language could bring user interactivity to new levels. Tele-reality converges toward use of synthesized images or videos that are generated by merging and processing information about people, place, time, mode, weather, recent events and more. In addition, this article also illustrates how current standard user profiles and application programming interfaces are leveraged in order to accommodate such services.",

      "abstract": "The original BGP design requires that all BGP speakers within an autonomous system be directly connected with each other to create a full mesh, and BGP update messages be propagated to directly connected neighbors only. This requirement leads to BGP session scalability problems in networks with large numbers of BGP routers. Route reflection was proposed as a quick fix to address this BGP session scalability problem and has been widely deployed in the operational Internet without a thorough analysis of its pros and cons. In this article, we first provide an overview of the route reflection design, summarize the discoveries from published literature, and discuss the trade-offs in using route reflection as compared to using a fully connected i-BGP mesh. Then we show that well engineered route reflector placement can overcome certain drawbacks, and that a few issues remain open for future study.",

      "abstract": "An efficient dependable smart power grid relies on the secure real-time data collection and transmission service provided by a monitoring system. In such a system, the measuring units, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) and smart meters (SMs), are critical. These measuring equipments function as sensors in the smart grid. Data exchanges between these sensors and the central controller are protected by various security protocols. These protocols usually contain computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms that cause heavy energy overhead to the sensor nodes. Since PMUs and SMs are mostly energy-constrained, the problem of how to ensure the secure communication with minimum energy cost becomes a critical issue for the functionality of the whole smart grid. In this article, we focus on the low power secure communication of the PMUs and SMs. We take two wireless sensor platforms as examples to experimentally investigate the approaches and principles of reconciling the two conflicting system requirements-communication security and low energy consumptions. The proposed methods are general ones and applicable to other energy-constrained yet security sensitive systems.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks are designed to increase traffic safety by enabling fast reactions of drivers in critical situations. Vehicles exchange beacon messages about their current state and position using wireless communication to establish a certain level of awareness. Based on the received information, the collision probability with neighboring vehicles can be calculated. To calculate a collision probability accurately, highly up-to-date knowledge about the movement of potential collision partners is required. Due to the dynamic network topology, vehicles are supposed to send periodic beacons at an increased transmit rate. However, as wireless communication suffers from packet interference issues in saturated communication channels, an increased beacon rate also raises the interference probability. Thus, decreasing interference by increasing the awareness level seems contradictory. To overcome this issue, we introduce our beaconing as a service (BaaS) approach, which follows two core aspects: first, controlling the beacon rate intelligently with respect to the real benefit of a message transmission (e.g., when a vehicle detects a potential collision situation); and second, utilizing the overall communication bandwidth, which is divided into several communication channels. In this sense BaaS specifies a context-aware request/response beaconing strategy utilizing multiple channels simultaneously.",

Next-generation 100G MMF and SMF client optics will be based on 4 \u00d7 25G electrical lane and 4 \u00d7 25G optical lane architecture. Beyond 100G, it is likely the next standard will be 400G based on extensions of 100G technologies. Beyond 400G, 1.6T is a possible standard, requiring highly novel technologies.",

The networks of such therapeutic NMs, body area nanonetworks (BAN<sup>2</sup>s), also empower sophisticated nanomedicine applications. In these applications, therapeutic NMs share information to perform computation and logic operations, and make decisions to treat complex diseases. Hence, one of the most challenging subjects for these sophisticated applications is the realization of BAN<sup>2</sup> through a nanoscale communication paradigm. In this article, we introduce the concept of a BAN<sup>2</sup> with molecular communication, where messenger molecules are used as communication carrier from a sender to a receiver NM. The current state of the art of molecular communication and BAN<sup>2</sup> in nanomedicine applications is first presented. Then communication theoretical efforts are reviewed, and open research issues are given. The objective of this work is to introduce this novel and interdisciplinary research field and highlight major barriers toward its realization from the viewpoint of communication theory.",

      "abstract": "The role of the Internet has been changed to a content oriented data sharing network. This new paradigm requires a major transformation of the current Internet architecture, which leads to the birth of the Information Centric Networking (ICN) concept in today's Internet. In this article, we propose an ICN architecture named Cache Aware Target identification (CATT) and introduce the architecture by focusing on two of its major components: routing and content caching. For each component of the CATT, Potential Based Routing (PBR) and topology aware caching policy are proposed respectively, and their cooperated operation is illustrated. Due to the synergy effect of both components, the CATT provides an efficient solution of content dissemination in the ICN environment.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of several new cellular and connectivity radio standards has attracted the wireless industry to the concept of softwaredefined radio systems, preferably implemented in advanced nanometer CMOS technology. Several novel circuits and architectures have been investigated to cope with the huge design challenges involved, an overview of which will be given in this article. First, two digitally inspired receiver approaches are presented in detail. Discrete-time radio receivers exploit the paradigm that time is better controllable than voltage in modern CMOS, and are implemented using transistors mainly as switches. RF ADCs digitize the signal as close as possible to the antenna, but still require highspeed analog circuits to achieve the required performance. The second part of the article presents a \"traditional\" direct-conversion architecture, including also a transmitter, where several new circuits and architectures are used to exploit as much as possible the capabilities of a modern digital CMOS technology.",

However, as more personal and business applications migrate to the cloud, service quality will become an important differentiator between providers. In particular, quality of experience as perceived by users has the potential to become the guiding paradigm for managing quality in the cloud. In this article, we discuss technical challenges emerging from shifting services to the cloud, as well as how this shift impacts QoE and QoE management. Thereby, a particular focus is on multimedia cloud applications. Together with a novel QoE-based classification scheme of cloud applications, these challenges drive the research agenda on QoE management for cloud applications.",

Concerning the actual implementation of such a CCC, the focus was recently moved toward an in-band solution, where the information is transported building on existing radio access technologies. In this scope, this article illustrates relevant technical scenarios in which CCCs can be exploited and outlines a set of derived system requirements. The article provides an overview of various possible RAT independent and dependent implementation options, such as Diameter, distributed agents, 3GPP radio resource control (RRC) mechanisms, IEEE 802.21, IEEE 802.11, WiMedia UWB, and Bluetooth. The advantages and drawbacks of the various options are discussed.",

However, it is more rarely performed than simulation because of the difficulties in coding and debugging as well as lack of scalability and repeatability. In this article, the concept of a code-reuse platform making use of a simulation code directly for real experiments is revisited as an efficient and easy means of experimentation. Furthermore, an architecture and key components of an idealistic code-reuse platform are suggested, and then CommonCode, the most advanced codereuse platform, is proposed. Through extensive simulations and experiments using Common-Code for the same codes, we demonstrate that CommonCode is valid and accurate in terms of protocol performance, and simultaneously fast and easy in terms of protocol development.",

      "abstract": "Cloud computing and other highly virtualized data center applications have placed many new and unique requirements on the data center network infrastructure. Conventional network protocols and architectures such as Spanning Tree Protocol and multichassis link aggregation can limit the scale, latency, throughput, and virtual machine mobility for large cloud networks. This has led to a multitude of new networking protocols and architectures. We present a tutorial on some of the key requirements for cloud computing networks and the various approaches that have been proposed to implement them. These include industry standards (e.g., TRILL, SPB, software-defined networking, and OpenFlow), best practices for standards-based data center networking (e.g., the open datacenter interoperable network), as well as vendor proprietary approaches (e.g., FabricPath, VCS, and Qfabric).",

      "abstract": "The inherent context-awareness properties of pervasive computing and the need for efficient user profiling and location information management quickly made it obvious that context management would become a top priority requirement in telecommunications service platforms. What we now call social networking was \"born\" around the early-mid `00s, a time when the first context management models and frameworks were being designed for the market. While the world was developing the first context management systems, social networking was growing fast; so fast in fact that no one can afford to ignore it any more. The introduction of smartphones into the global telecommunications market enabled social networking to actually change the way people lived, the way they communicated, and their habits. Information and Communication Technologies research has started taking this new reality very seriously and numerous initiatives have invested in relevant projects, in order to explore all social networking aspects and incorporate its logic in the lowest architectural layers. This article presents a short historical review of the evolution of various aspects of context management in pervasive computing systems, it revisits the earlier models, in order to put community context where it belongs, it presents a context management architecture that is suitable for pervasive services combined with social networking and explores its added value for users all over the world.",

      "abstract": "When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005, it severely damaged the telecommunications infrastructure, isolating the area from the outside world. With all the high-end emergency communication gear in its path being knocked out by the hurricane, highfrequency (HF) amateur radio systems played a critical role in rescue and recovery operations. Such tragic incidents have resulted in re-appreciation of the \"good old\" HF technology that has been an essential part of worldwide information transmission since the advent of radio. HF systems traditionally have been associated with analog voice and very-low-rate data transmission. With the shift from analog to digital in voice communication and increasing demands for high-rate data transmission (e.g., email, Internet, FTP), HF communication has been going through a renaissance. Innovative techniques are required to push the capacity limits of the HF band. Our tutorial provides a contemporary overview of HF communication and discusses cooperative diversity as an enabler to support the challenging expectations of future-generation HF communication systems.",

      "abstract": "Data dissemination services embrace a wide variety of telematic applications where data packets are generated at a remote server in the Internet and destined to a group of nomadic users such as vehicle passengers and pedestrians. The quality of a data dissemination service is highly dependent on the availability of network infrastructures in terms of the access points. In this article, we investigate the utilization of roadside wireless local area networks (RS-WLANs) as a network infrastructure for data dissemination. A two-level cooperative data dissemination approach is presented. With the network-level cooperation, the resources in the RS-WLANs are used to facilitate the data dissemination services for the nomadic users. The packet-level cooperation is exploited to improve the packet transmission rate to a nomadic user. Various techniques for the two levels of cooperation are discussed. A case study is presented to evaluate the performance of the data dissemination approach.",

      "abstract": "Event detection in wireless sensor networks is a sophisticated method for processing sampled data directly on the sensor nodes, thereby reducing the need for multihop communication with the base station of the network. In contrast to application-agnostic compression or aggregation techniques, event detection pushes application-level knowledge into the network. In-network event detection - especially the distributed form involving multiple sensor nodes - has thus an exceptional potential to increase energy efficiency, thus prolonging the lifetime of the network. In this article, we summarize recently proposed system architectures and algorithms employed for event detection in wireless sensor networks. On the example of the AVS-Extrem platform, we illustrate how energy-efficient event detection can be implemented through a combination of custom hardware design and distributed event detection algorithms. We then continue to present a brief evaluation of the detection accuracy and the energy consumption that is achievable by current systems.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative network coding has been proposed as an effective solution to improve system performance. Through collaborative network coding in the intermediate node(s) instead of direct forwarding, the transmission reliability, efficiency, and security can be enhanced significantly. Although extensive research activity on the cooperative network coding has been reported in the literature, most works focused only on their technical analyses, and no effort has been made so far on its applications in IMT-Advanced systems. In this article, we take a first look at possible application scenarios in order to design the needed protocols for cooperative network coding in futuristic wireless communication systems. The architectures of cooperative network coding schemes are presented in this article for their possible applications in two-way, multiple access, and multicast cooperative relays. The key techniques for implementing these three network coded cooperative relay schemes are identified, and their performances are evaluated. At the end of this article, the major challenges in terms of technical standardization that may affect the application of cooperative network coding in the IMT-Advanced systems are discussed as well.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a promising technology that enables an unlicensed user (also known as a cognitive user) to identify the white space of a licensed spectrum band (called a spectrum hole) and utilize the detected spectrum hole for its data transmissions. To design a reliable and efficient cognitive radio system, there are two fundamental issues: to devise an accurate and robust spectrum sensing algorithm to detect spectrum holes as accurately as possible; and to design a secondary user transmission mechanism for the cognitive user to utilize the detected spectrum holes as efficiently as possible. This article investigates and shows that cooperative relay technology can significantly benefit the abovementioned two issues, spectrum sensing and secondary transmissions. We summarize existing research about the application of cooperative relays for spectrum sensing (referred to as the cooperative sensing) and address the related potential challenges. We discuss the use of cooperative relays for the secondary transmissions with a primary user's quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, for which a diversity-multiplexing trade-off is developed. In addition, this article shows a trade-off design of cognitive transmissions with cooperative relays by jointly considering the spectrum sensing and secondary transmissions in cognitive radio networks.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid will become the next-generation electrical power system to provide reliable, efficient, secure, and cost-effective energy generation, distribution, and consumption. To achieve these goals, communications infrastructure and wireless networking will play an important role in supporting data transfer and information exchange in smart grid. In this article, the application of cooperative transmission for the meter data collection in smart grid is introduced. In a service area of smart grid, there are multiple communities composed of power consumption nodes (e.g., houses). The power consumption demand from the nodes is measured by a smart meter and transmitted to a meter data management system (MDMS) through the data aggregator unit (DAU) using wireless broadband access. The community invests in and deploys a relay station to perform relay transmission to improve the transmission rate and avoid congestion at the DAU. As a result, the MDMS will have complete and correct power demand data, which can be used to make better decisions on power supply. Since the communities in a service area of smart grid are rational, they will optimize the relay transmission strategy so that the total cost (i.e., power cost and transmission cost) is minimized. To analyze the relay transmission strategy of the community, the noncooperative game model is formulated, and the Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution. The proposed network architecture and analysis will be useful for the design and optimization of a wireless network for smart grid.",

      "abstract": "Advanced interference mitigation techniques relying on multipoint coordination have attracted significant attention from the wireless industry and academia in the past few years. In 3GPP LTE-Advanced, a work item on Coordinated Multiple Point transmission and reception (CoMP) was initiated in September 2011, and it is one of the core features of Release 11. The objective of this work item is to provide the necessary specification support to efficiently realize the benefits of cooperative transmission in the downlink and cooperative reception in the uplink. This article discusses the specification support for CoMP and the motivations behind the specific design choices. The deployment scenarios that were considered for the application of CoMP in Release 11 are also presented.",

      "abstract": "3GPP has completed a study on coordinated multipoint transmission and reception techniques to facilitate cooperative communications across multiple transmission and reception points (e.g., cells) for the LTE-Advanced system. In CoMP operation, multiple points coordinate with each other in such a way that the transmission signals from/to other points do not incur serious interference or even can be exploited as a meaningful signal. The goal of the study is to evaluate the potential performance benefits of CoMP techniques and the implementation aspects including the complexity of the standards support for CoMP. This article discusses some of the deployment scenarios in which CoMP techniques will likely be most beneficial and provides an overview of CoMP schemes that might be supported in LTE-Advanced given the modern silicon/DSP technologies and backhaul designs available today. In addition, practical implementation and operational challenges are discussed. We also assess the performance benefits of CoMP in these deployment scenarios with traffic varying from low to high load.",

      "abstract": "Reliability in optical access networks is becoming a crucial issue for both operators and users due to the enormous increase of capacity and the importance of uninterrupted access to network services. Consequently, the growing number of users requesting penalties for connection interruptions is motivating for investing in protection mechanisms in fiber access networks. The investments involved depend on several aspects such as technology and covered area (population density, distance, type of users, etc.). Moreover, the passive optical network is considered one of the most beneficial fiber access solutions from the capital expenditures point of view; in particular, we are witnessing a wide deployment of TDM PONs. Keeping in mind that cost is a major issue in the access part of the network, in this article we propose a cost-efficient way to provide protection in a TDM PON considering different deployment scenarios in respect to population density in the access network area. The cost efficiency is obtained by taking advantage of investment cost reduction caused by sharing the same duct by both working and protection fibers. In order to evaluate the investment associated with the deployment of the proposed protection schemes, we take into account three different approaches: provide protection in the access network from the beginning, invest initially on an unprotected architecture keeping in mind a future upgrade with protection resources, and roll out an unprotected access network and, if needed in the future, invest in deployment of protection resources. The cost parameters considered in this article include investment in the infrastructure and installation, as well as the operational expenditures associated with failure reparation and service interruption penalties. Our results confirm that the proposed reliable PON architectures can achieve significant reduction of service interruption at very low increase in investment cost, leading to a great decrease of the total cost of ownership. Finally, some useful guidance for cost-efficient deployment of protection in fiber access networks is provided along with a sensitivity study to point out the key cost factors.",

      "abstract": "In a time when media content, including user-generated, is flooding the Internet, and WebTV services are becoming more and more attractive and competitive, \u201cfenced wall\u201d IPTV operators need to come up with clear benefits, focusing on high content quality and guaranteed QoS/QoE. Quality guarantees can be achieved only via an end-to-end network and service management architecture, supported by an efficient monitoring system. This article discusses cross-layer IPTV service and network monitoring approaches, presenting overall aims and challenges, metrics to be monitored, and measurement strategies according to point of observation (in-network or client-side monitoring). Finally, it presents the monitoring system developed within the ALICANTE research project as an example of a complete end-to-end cross-layer monitoring framework for media services.",

      "abstract": "Information sharing systems such as iCloud, Dropbox, Facebook, and Twitter are ubiquitous today, but all of them depend on massive server infrastructure and always-on Internet connectivity. We have designed and implemented a sharing system that does not require infrastructure yet supports robust, distributed, secure sharing by opportunistically using any and all connectivity, local or global, permanent or transient, to communicate. One key element of this system is a new information routing model that so far has proven to be as scalable and efficient as the best of the current Internet routing protocols, while operating in an environment more complex and dynamic than they can tolerate. The new routing model is made possible by new affordances offered by information-centric networking, in particular, the open source CCN [1] release. This article describes the new system and its routing model, and provides some performance measurements.",

      "abstract": "The second generation of the Digital Video Broadcasting standard for Satellite transmission, DVB-S2, is the evolution of the highly successful DVB-S satellite distribution technology. DVB-S2 has benefited from the latest progress in channel coding and modulation such as Low Density Parity Check Codes and higher order constellations to achieve performance that approaches Shannon\u00bfs theoretical limit. We present a cross-layer design for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision of interactive services, which is not specified in the standard. Our cross-layer approach exploits the satellite channel characteristics of space-time correlation via a cross-layer queueing architecture and an adaptive cross-layer scheduling policy. We show that our approach not only allows system load control but also rate adaptation to channel conditions and traffic demands on the coverage area. We also present the extension of our cross-layer design for mobile gateways focusing on the railway scenario. We illustrate the trade-off between system-wide and individual throughput by means of simulation, and that this trade-off could be a key metric in measuring the service level of DVB-S2 Broadband Service.",

      "abstract": "The realization of high data rates in LTE technology over an all IP network means an ever increasing load on packet data networks. 3GPP has defined data offloading as a key solution to cope with this challenge. Data offloading has been a critical area of study in 3GPP Release-10. The 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) has been defined to be expansive; for example, it is designed to work in conjunction with non-3GPP access networks, femto cells etc., This diversity causes more scenarios to tackle, but it also provides solutions in the ways of offloading data from the EPC. This article is a tutorial on three such mechanisms, namely Local IP Access (LIPA), Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO) and IP Flow Mobility (IFOM). The article starts with an overview of data offloading methods. The basics and key concepts of each method are summarized before giving the requirements, architecture and procedures with high-level message flows. The article ends with a brief evaluation of the mechanisms and references for the reader interested in further reading.",

      "abstract": "This article presents experimental and simulation results for the use of TV band devices (TVBDs) in TV white space, considering the presence of interference by incumbent services. Digital TV (DTV) services are major incumbent services currently operating in the TV bands. With DTV service, co-channel and adjacent channel deployment scenarios of TVBD networks are introduced. To safely protect the incumbent service, a minimum separation distance from the DTV protected contour, which is called the keep-out distance, is required. We estimate the keep-out distance for different ranges of TVBD transmit antenna height by using several propagation models and measurements of ultra-high-frequency signals in Korea. We also investigate the hidden node problem for the spectrum sensing operation mode of TVBDs. According to the results of these measurements, the hidden node margin should be at least 38 dB in order to protect DTV service. Finally, the service coverage reduction of TVBD networks caused by neighboring DTV service is discussed. It is shown that the service coverage of a wireless local area network system decreases about 50 percent by co-channel interference from neighboring DTV service when the field strength of the DTV received signal is 41 dBu.",

Relative to the traditional cellular methods, there is a need to design new peer discovery methods, physical layer procedures, and radio resource management algorithms that help realize the potential advantages of D2D communications. In this article we use the 3GPP Long Term Evolution system as a baseline for D2D design, review some of the key design challenges, and propose solution approaches that allow cellular devices and D2D pairs to share spectrum resources and thereby increase the spectrum and energy efficiency of traditional cellular networks. Simulation results illustrate the viability of the proposed design.",

Technological solutions as well as entire architectures have been proposed with subtle but seemingly important differences. In this article, we define a set of design tenets for an information-centric architecture together with a demonstration of its feasibility. For the latter, we present an early prototype of an artifact that is directly based on our design framework. This prototype is available under open source, deployed in a European-wide testbed, and can be used for Planetlab-scale experiments. Early indications of its performance show promising results for our future work.",

Generic models of the process are analyzed based on the real-world data collected in seven developed countries during the years 2000-2010. The key contribution of this study is threefold: (a) Comparison of simple model predictions with an ensemble of empirical data, showing excellent agreement (b) Introduction of alternative ways of the determination of model parameters from empirical data (c) Introduction of a two-component continuous model, and a discrete-time model that covers monotonic, periodic, or chaotic growth paths The models may be useful in research, planning, managing, and monitoring of broadband services deployment, and in policy considerations.",

      "abstract": "A digital power amplifier (DPA) that uses switched-capacitor circuits in 90 nm CMOS to efficiently amplify signals with large peak-toaverage power ratios is described in this article. In traditional DPAs, a digital code word representing a desired output envelope voltage is used to control a combination of wide-dynamic range current sources. In contrast, the switched-capacitor power amplifier (SCPA) provides a linear output characteristic by using the digital code word to selectively switch or not switch a bank of integrated capacitors at the RF carrier frequency. Therefore, the SCPA combines the functionalities of an envelope DAC and a power amplifier, and achieves excellent efficiency and output power levels. The SCPA benefits from CMOS transistor scaling, which makes RF SOC integration realizable.",

A more accurate measurement of up-to-date electricity necessities through smart meters utilization leads to an enhancement in the ability of monitoring, controlling and predicting energy use. Nevertheless, it has associated drawbacks related to the privacy of customers as well, since such management might reveal their personal habits and behavior, which electrical appliances they are using at each moment, whether they are at home or not, and so on. In this article we present a privacy enhanced architecture for smart metering aimed to tackle this threat by means of a new and novel protocol encrypting individual measurements while allowing the electricity supplier to access the aggregation of the corresponding decrypted values. The technique being used is named additively homomorphic encryption, and enables the direct connection and exchange of data between electricity suppliers and final users, while preserving the privacy of the latter.",

      "abstract": "Single-user multi-antenna technologies are well upported in current standard specifications like LTE Release 8/9. Further development of the specification (LTE-Advanced) is expected to conform to the requirements for IMT-Advanced systems. One of the key enabling features of LTE-Advanced to meet IMT-Advanced downlink performance requirements is multi-user MIMO, where a transmitter serves multiple users simultaneously on the same frequency resource, primarily relying on spatial separation. In general, multi-user MIMO is beneficial for improving average user spectral efficiency. However, cell edge user spectral efficiency may be reduced if multi-user MIMO is used exclusively, due to residual inter-user interference arising from practical multi-user beamforming and reduced transmit power allocated to each user. Therefore, it should be possible to configure the UE-specific transmission mode to support dynamic switching between single-user MIMO and multi-user MIMO to balance the cell edge user spectral efficiency as well as the average cell user spectral efficiency. In this article, we study various aspects of multi-user MIMO including design philosophy, multi-user precoding, and control signaling. The associated feedback schemes, including those that facilitate dynamic switching, are discussed. Performance evaluation is conducted to demonstrate the gain of dynamically switched single-user and multiuser MIMO as opposed to traditional single-user MIMO.",

Virtual machine related features such as flexible resource provisioning, and isolation and migration of machine state have improved efficiency of resource usage and dynamic resource provisioning capabilities. Live virtual machine migration transfers \"state\" of a virtual machine from one physical machine to another, and can mitigate overload conditions and enables uninterrupted maintenance activities. The focus of this article is to present the details of virtual machine migration techniques and their usage toward dynamic resource management in virtualized environments. We outline the components required to use virtual machine migration for dynamic resource management in the virtualized cloud environment. We present categorization and details of migration heuristics aimed at reducing server sprawl, minimizing power consumption, balancing load across physical machines, and so on. We conclude with a discussion of open research problems in the area.",

      "abstract": "Transmissions in different cells of a time-division duplex system are typically synchronous in order to eliminate the base station-to-base station and terminal-to-terminal interference. The synchronous operation limits dynamic resource configuration for downlink and uplink transmissions. Today, as a large percentage of mobile traffic is generated in hotspots and indoor environments, heterogeneous networks comprising high-power/wide-area and low-power/local-area network nodes are becoming a reality. Such heterogeneous networks provide opportunities to exploit dynamic uplink-downlink configuration in TDD systems, adapting to the individual traffic needs of a specific cell area. This article presents a tutorial overview of dynamic uplink-downlink configuration and interference management in time-division Long Term Evolution, including motivations, target deployment scenarios, opportunities and challenges, system requirements, design aspects, and performance evaluations.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we build a simple engineering-economic model to evaluate the incentives of various network players to deploy distributed storage nodes (content stores and caches) to support information-centric network (ICN) architectures and the implications of those incentives on protocol design, industry structure and other policy issues, such as competition and network- neutrality. We find that without some explicit monetary compensation from publishers, networks will fail to deploy the socially optimal number of caches. We also study the social welfare implications of different cache deployment scenarios and identify two deployment scenarios that maximize social welfare. Finally, we show that ICN architectures provide numerous opportunities for large eyeball networks to leverage their terminating access monopoly to extract more profits from other network players. Hence, regulators must take steps to address issues such as interconnection and the role of caching infrastructure in differential quality of service provisioning in an ICN-based network architecture, in order to ensure socially desirable outcomes from their deployment.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity is an important property for information dissemination in a vehicular ad hoc network. Basically, connectivity ensures that a message from a source can be spread to reach all the vehicles in the network. Over the past few years, there have been a significant number of studies on connectivity models for vehicular ad hoc networks. Most of them rely on the key assumption that the intervehicle spacing distribution is exponential. However, based on a new empirical analysis, it is shown that during most periods of the day the intervehicle spacing distribution can better be described by other statistical distributions. This certainly affects the connectivity analysis. In this article, we discuss how the connectivity of a vehicular ad hoc network in a highway traffic scenario will change when the intervehicle spacing distribution is not exponential.",

      "abstract": "Optical networks are undergoing significant changes, fueled by the exponential growth of traffic due to multimedia services and by the increased uncertainty in predicting the sources of this traffic due to the ever changing models of content providers over the Internet. The change has already begun: simple on-off modulation of signals, which was adequate for bit rates up to 10 Gb/s, has given way to much more sophisticated modulation schemes for 100 Gb/s and beyond. The next bottleneck is the 10-year-old division of the optical spectrum into a fixed \"wavelength grid,\" which will no longer work for 400 Gb/s and above, heralding the need for a more flexible grid. Once both transceivers and switches become flexible, a whole new elastic optical networking paradigm is born. In this article we describe the drivers, building blocks, architecture, and enabling technologies for this new paradigm, as well as early standardization efforts.",

For such situations it is highly important to perform intersystem interference analyses not only for intentional transmitters but also for electromagnetic interference from other electric equipment. One example of such an interference source to consider is medical equipment in field hospitals since the hospitals can contain a large amount of interfering equipment. In this article, we show examples of necessary safety distances between medical equipment and tactical radio systems at military camps for international missions. We give an example of how wideband electromagnetic interference can degrade the performance even for a wideband frequency hopping army combat radio.",

      "abstract": "The Future Internet promises to pervade our everyday lives by interweaving an increased variety of access technologies (cellular broadband, wireless hotspots, short range radios). Cognitive network management is a promising approach to cope with such access diversity and to enable dynamic adaptation of the network configurations and parameters. This article reveals the insights and conclusions of a unique real life implementation of a cognitive architecture, comprising software agents and artificial intelligence algorithms, and its deployment within a heterogeneous access network composed of a Broadband WiMAX base station and WiFi access points. We discuss the architectural challenges that this approach poses, and present the distributed software architecture we implemented. We detail the experimental access network we deployed and the algorithms that enable channel reselection and vertical assisted handover. We conclude with our findings and recommendations for the deployment of cognitive network management architectures and technologies in the Future Internet.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency has become an increasingly important aspect of network design, due to both the increasing operational costs related to energy consumption and the increasing awareness of global warming and climate change. This article addresses the energy consumption of different next-generation optical access solutions beyond 10G TDM PONs. It is assumed that next-generation optical access should be able to provide sustainable data rates up to 1 Gb/s per subscriber with a passive fan-out of at least 1:64. Promising system candidates that meet these criteria are compared and analyzed in terms of energy consumption. Candidate PON solutions are also compared to architectures based on point-to-point fiber. A systematic approach is developed for the energy consumption comparison. The analysis is based on estimates of power consumption for key components in next-generation systems. Among the considered candidates, we find that WDM-PON based on RSOA, stacked 10G TDM-PON, and point-to-point fiber offer the lowest power per line potential.",

      "abstract": "Optical fibers have often been considered to offer effectively infinite capacity to support the rapid traffic growth essential to our information society. However, as demand has grown and technology has developed, we have begun to realize that there is a fundamental limit to fiber capacity of ~ 100 Tb/s per fiber for systems based on conventional single-core single-mode optical fiber as the transmission medium. This limit arises from the interplay of a number of factors including the Shannon limit, optical fiber nonlinearities, the fiber fuse effect, as well as optical amplifier bandwidth. This article reviews the most recent research efforts around the globe launched over the past few years with a view to overcome these limitations and substantially increase capacity by exploring the last degree of freedom available: the spatial domain. Central to this effort has been the development of brand new fibers for space-division multiplexing and mode-division multiplexing.",

This standard covers the terminal, radio, core network, and user service aspects. This MBMS standard has evolved into enhanced MBMS (eMBMS) that builds on top of the 3GPP Long Term Evolution standard. eMBMS evolution brings improved performance thanks to higher and more flexible LTE bit rates, single frequency network operations, and carrier configuration flexibility. 3GPP Rel-11 also brings improvements in the areas of service layer with, for example, video codec for higher resolutions and frame rate, and forward error correction. eMBMS allows offloading of the LTE network and backhaul. It enables the possibility to deliver premium content to many users with secured quality of service in defined areas. Other important use cases are pushed content via user equipment caching and machine-to-machine services. This article describes the relevant use cases for eMBMS in terms of service. It then gives a tutorial on eMBMS, in particular highlighting the evolution over MBMS. The scope comprises the radio access, core network, and service layer.",

      "abstract": "The \"smart big bang\" has changed the way online content is presented and consumed. Traditionally, most service providers have created their own web pages and developed loyal customers to support their online content on the Internet. However, as smart devices have become more popular, service providers have started creating new web applications optimized for smart devices by reusing existing online content. Despite their costly efforts, delivering online content to customers using those web applications continues to be difficult. This is mainly due to the limitations of web applications in supporting all the characteristics of smart devices. Our proposed application is one example of a ComSoc smart phone application adapted from a traditional ComSoc web application using a mixed approach of mobile web and native applications. This article presents the overall process for developing a ComSoc smart phone application, including requirement analysis, system architecture design, and implementation. We also present key lessons learned from our overall experience during design and development.",

      "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks comprise nodes with multiple radio interfaces, and can provide low-cost high-speed Internet access or connectivity for data transfer. In this article we report our experiences and investigations with an experimental metropolitan multiradio mesh network that covers an area of approximately 60 km<sup>2</sup> in the city of Heraklion, Crete. We present the design and deployment of the network, experiments to quantify the network's performance, and an application that runs on top of it and exploits it's low-cost wide-area connectivity. The metropolitan network consists of 16 nodes, among which six are core nodes, each with up to four 802.11a wireless interfaces and an additional wireless interface for management and monitoring. The distance between core mesh nodes varies from 1.6 to 5 km, and the mesh network contains two gateways that connect it to a wired network. Our performance experiments involve rate, power, and channel control for long-distance metropolitan links, and include investigations of the timescales for the operation for these mechanisms. Finally, we present a system for continuous online electromagnetic field monitoring and spectrum sensing, which utilizes the metropolitan mesh network for collecting wide-area measurements from low-cost EMF measurement devices.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, we use mobile applications and services in our daily life activities, to support our needs for information, communication or leisure. However, user acceptance of a mobile application depends on at least two conditions: the application's perceived experience, and the appropriateness of the application to the user's context and needs. However, we have a weak understanding of a mobile user's quality of experience (QoE) and the factors influencing it. This article presents a 4-week-long 29-Androidphone- user study, where we collected both QoE and the underlying network's quality of service measurements through a combination of user, application, and network data on the user's phones. We aimed to derive and improve the understanding of users' QoE for a set of widely used mobile applications in users' natural environments and different daily contexts. We present data acquired in the study and discuss implications for mobile applications design.",

      "abstract": "Context-aware applications aim at providing personalized services to end users. Sensors and context sources are able to provide enormous amounts of valuable information about individuals that can be used to drive the behavior of services and applications, and adapt them to the specific conditions and preferences of each user. Thanks to advances in mobility, convergence and integration, increasingly larger amounts of these data are available in the Internet. However, this context information is usually fragmented, and traditionally applications have had to take care of context management themselves. This work presents a solution for a converged context management framework and how it can be employed in a future Internet to integrate data from all context sources and serve it to client applications in a seamless and transparent manner. This framework takes advantage of the intelligent and convergent features of next-generation networks, allowing seamless integration, monitoring, and control of heterogeneous sensors and devices under a single context-aware service layer. This layer is centered on a context intelligence module, capable of combining clustering algorithms and semantics to learn from user usage history and take advantage of that information to infer missing or high-level context data.",

      "abstract": "LTE and LTE-Advanced have undeniably provided a major step forward in mobile communication capability, enabling mobile service provisioning to approach for the first time that available from fixed-line connections. However, market demands typically do not evolve simply in discrete steps; therefore, the future evolution of LTE-Advanced will be a story of continuous enhancement, on one hand taking advantage of the advancing capabilities of technology, while on the other aiming to keep pace with the expectations and needs of the end users. In this article, the likely directions of this continuing enhancement are discussed, and some areas where further technical advancement will be required are identified. In particular, potential measures to enhance the efficiency of spectrum utilization by joint multicell optimization, dynamic adaptation of the network to traffic characteristics and load levels, and support for new applications are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Considerations of efficiency often play an important role in debates on how to allocate new spectrum. Regulators want to maximize the common good, and try to use efficiency as a tool to do so; consequently, all the stakeholders strive to show that their proposal leads to efficient use of resources. However, often the discussion on particular methods or allocations becomes deadlocked. In this article we explore what is meant by efficiency metrics in wireless networks and what underlies the widely divergent claims for the relative efficiency of competing solutions. Our treatment attempts to take into account the regulatory and policy viewpoints on the development of system efficiency metrics. We will argue that it is important to define system optimization considerations and design goals for future wireless systems more clearly than has been done to date. We will show that although this may sound simple, it is far from it. We argue that efficiency needs to be analyzed within a full N-dimensional design space, and that connections between technology and policy need to be stated explicitly.",

In this article we compare the historical trend of TDM PON bandwidth supply and the growth of residential bandwidth demands to the end of this decade, and conclude that bandwidth supply is growing much faster than the demand, calling into question the need for WDM PON. Further, we distinguish between sustained bandwidth demand and burst bandwidth demand, and further conclude that TDM PON will deliver future ultra-high speed services more efficiently than WDM PON.",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth of mobile communications, and the overly crowded and expensive spectrum have pushed both system engineers and operators to make their systems as spectrally efficient as possible in order to accommodate the increasing traffic demand. This article is a tutorial introduction to the orthogonal subchannel (OSC) technique. OSC was adopted to improve the capacity of the GSM/EDGE radio access network GERAN, and it is a new concept in which two users can simultaneously share the same GSM radio resource (time slot and frequency) in both the downlink and in uplink directions. Potentially, OSC could not only provide increased network capacity, but also reduce network-associated costs through more efficient usage of hardware and spectrum resources. In addition, this article presents some challenges related to this method, as well as solutions and their respective impact. The results provided herein may contribute to guidelines for network dimensioning and optimization, as well as list potential enhancements to the OSC radio resource management mechanisms needed to further exploit the benefits of OSC. Currently, in real OSC network deployments a capacity gain of 50 percent has been achieved at the cell level. As an indication of the importance of OSC, GSMA awarded it (called Quad Rate) the Best Technology Breakthrough award at Mobile World Congress 2012 [1].",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of internet-connected mobile devices will continue to drive growth in data traffic in an exponential fashion, forcing network operators to dramatically increase the capacity of their networks. To do this cost-effectively, a paradigm shift in cellular network infrastructure deployment is occurring away from traditional (expensive) high-power tower-mounted base stations and towards heterogeneous elements. Examples of heterogeneous elements include microcells, picocells, femtocells, and distributed antenna systems (remote radio heads), which are distinguished by their transmit powers/ coverage areas, physical size, backhaul, and propagation characteristics. This shift presents many opportunities for capacity improvement, and many new challenges to co-existence and network management. This article discusses new theoretical models for understanding the heterogeneous cellular networks of tomorrow, and the practical constraints and challenges that operators must tackle in order for these networks to reach their potential.",

      "abstract": "Network traffic demands are forecast to increase for the foreseeable future, with the challenge being to meet the demand while maintaining or lowering network costs. Simply increasing capacity will not be sufficient; overall bandwidth utilization also needs to improve. A combination of improved transport capacity through increased spectral efficiency and bit rate along with better network utilization by integrating subchannel electrical grooming into the transmission system will be required. Smarter ways to utilize optical capacity are key since transmission costs have been decreasing slower than grooming and switching costs. Integrated transport and switching can improve the efficiency of the client network using techniques such as port virtualization and transit traffic reduction. The baseline for transport networks will be 100 Gb/s PM-QPSK using 50 GHz channel spacing. Moving from a fixed DWDM channel arrangement to support flexible grid and super channels will allow tighter channel (carrier) spacing and should increase capacity by 30 to 50 percent. For shorter distances higher-order modulation such as 16-QAM can double network capacity. To better optimize network efficiency, an architecture that flexibly combines lower rate (sub-100 Gb/s) clients to form channels (carriers) and then superchannels will be required.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of 3G and LTE has again made mobile backhaul a key area of investigation for service providers. Many operators carry a huge bag of legacy circuit-switched backhaul that is not capable of carrying today's data hungry applications. This article examines hybrid microwave radios as one of the technologies to address this challenge and summarizes some of the associated testing aspects. Unlike its predecessor, it supports both circuit- and packetswitched services. In this article we have discussed the technology and analyzed the products to understand its implications for operators like Telenor. We conducted more than 100 field tests starting from basic bit error rate testing all the way to product interoperability, adaptive modulation, carrier Ethernet, ring protection, and synchronization. The focus of this article is on such key tests, and basic microwave radio testing is briefly described only for illustrative purposes. Although the ride was not very bumpy, we did face challenges in terms of product maturity and interoperability. Moreover, we provide possible solutions to address these challenges.",

This article concentrates on the factors which affect the latency of packet delivery and specifically on the variable part of this latency. Change in the latency of packet delivery is called packet delay variation. PDV impacts the quality of timing distribution in the absence of specific assistance. We show the behavior of different packet equipment. We describe the possible root cause of the demonstrated behavior and put in perspective their effect on timing flows. We show that some equipment would require assistance in distributing timing packet, while others have limited bounded impact on PDV without any special assistance.",

Nevertheless, these devices remain mostly restricted to research, in part due to limited miniaturization, power supply constraints, and lack of a reliable interface between implants and external devices. This article provides a tutorial on the design of implantable biomedical devices that addresses these limitations. Specifically, it presents analysis and techniques for wireless power transfer and efficient data transfer from both theoretical and practical standpoints. Their potential implementations are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide traction for EPON has led to the development of the Service Interoperability in EPON (SIEPON) specification. This standard is being developed to ensure EPON equipment from different vendors will interoperate not just at the physical layer, but at higher service layers as well. One of the main aspects that SIEPON addresses is the establishment of QoS in EPON. The QoS service parameters include bandwidth assignment to subscriber traffic, frame delay, frame delay variation, and frame loss ratio. The guarantees implied by these parameters are needed for operators deploying time- and delay sensitive real-time services such as IPTV, VoIP, and circuit emulation. The SIEPON standard defines a flexible EPON service path (ESP) that enables operators to configure bandwidth-related service quality parameters to which EPON devices adhere. In this article, we describe how QoS is realized in EPON using the ESP and other concepts defined in SIEPON.",

      "abstract": "Mobile Social Network (MSN) is a social network where one or more elements share interests or commonalities by connecting with one another using mobile devices. However, contrary to traditional online social networks, efficient communication and information exchanged depends on mobile users' context. In order to increase the scalability of the information exchange, network nodes need to be associated and grouped through an efficient set of rules and criterions, to minimize the time and amount of data messages flowing in the network. This article shows how social-based metrics can increase the efficiency of layer 2 associations in mobile networks, where nodes are able to join the network through their context information and probable interactions, optimizing the information exchange at MAC layer. Through a case study of mobile communications with different mobility patterns and dissemination approaches, we show that the social-based metrics increase overall network efficiency: maximize the percentage of information delivery, decrease the time to disseminate data traffic and reduce network usage.",

      "abstract": "The tremendous growth in demand for broadband data is forcing ISPs to use pricing as a congestion management tool. This changing landscape of Internet access pricing is evidenced by the elimination of flat rate data plans in favor of usage-based pricing by major wired and wireless operators in the US and Europe. But simple usage-based fees suffer from the problem of imposing costs on all users, irrespective of the network congestion level at a given time. To effectively reduce network congestion, appropriate incentives must be provided to users who are willing to time-shift their data demand from peak to off-peak periods. These pricing incentives can either be static (e.g., two-period daytime/nighttime prices) or computed dynamically (e.g., dayahead pricing, real-time pricing). Data plans that offer such incentives to consumers fall under the category of time-dependent pricing (TDP). Many ISPs across the world are currently exploring various forms of TDP to manage their traffic growth. This article first outlines the sources of today\u00bfs challenges, and then discusses current trends from regulatory and technological perspectives. Finally, we review representative pricing proposals for incentivizing the time-shifting of data.",

      "abstract": "Indoor wireless networks connect an increasing number of people to the Internet. Unfortunately, spectrum is limited, and the increasing traffic leads to increased interference. We propose a novel network architecture that reconfigures topologies and frequency bands, adapting to changing indoor traffic demands. The key idea is to have fixed antennas throughout a building, and adaptively switch the connections between these antennas and a number of signal processing units which are each able to handle a fixed number of frequency bands. Our new architecture requires less infrastructure, and frequency utilization is significantly more efficient than in current architectures. Also, our new architecture can be applied to existing wireless standards, including GSM and WLAN. Simulations show that the new architecture is able to improve network satisfaction regarding traffic demands by 75 percent and reduce infrastructure investment by 30 percent on a particular practical case study, compared to current techniques.",

      "abstract": "Millions of people now use online social network applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. This kind of application offers the freedom for end users to easily share contents on the Internet. In parallel with the expansion of OSNs, a new networking paradigm emerges, the information-centric networking approach, where the focus is on the content the user wishes to obtain instead of the server that provides this content: a content-based approach instead of a host-centric one. Looking at the ICN concept, and more precisely the CCN (which stands for content-centric networking) solution in this article (based on Interest-Data messages), and at OSNs behavior (users subscribing to contents posted by another user in case of Twitter, or the notion of friends receiving contents from others friends in Facebook), we advocate that the CCN paradigm perfectly fits with the OSN applications behavior and can help to save network load. In this article, we describe how OSN applications can run with the CCN solution and the evaluation we have performed highlights the benefit of using such a CCN approach compared to the current classical IP-based delivery and to the CDN-based solution, for the use-case of Twitter. Depending on the CCN nodes location and the cache efficiency, the network load can be significantly reduced and the response time to get the content can be faster up to 60 percent.",

      "abstract": "With the ever growing usage of various wireless technologies and services, more and more handheld devices are equipped with multiple radio transceivers (e.g., LTE, WiFi, Bluetooth, and GNSS). As a result, in-device coexistence interference has become a serious problem due to the extreme proximity of multiple radio transceivers within the same device. It has been shown by the studies of 3GPP that for some specific frequency bands, concurrent operations of LTE and ISM/GNSS radios working in adjacent or sub-harmonic frequencies will result in significant in-device coexistence interference that cannot be completely eliminated by filter technology. This motivates 3GPP to introduce signaling mechanisms and procedures, which enable the devices to effectively solve the indevice coexistence problems with help from the LTE network. This article first discusses the scenarios in which coexistence interference may happen, and then provides an overview of main solutions and related procedures specified in 3GPP Release-11 standards for LTE. In addition, some aspects of device-internal coordination and implementation to facilitate the coexistence scenarios are also discussed.",

We propose the receiver structure based on advanced binary optical logic gates (ABOLGs). Since the performance bottleneck in optical communication systems is the conversion from optical to electronic domains for optical detectors, the interference cancellation has been performed in the optical domain. In incoherent optical communication systems, we have only the positive values for the optical signals. In the proposed system, we bypass the negative values using logic arrays. In the simulations we consider multiple access interference and neglect other sources of noise. Simulation results show that in the future optical systems, the interference can be eliminated completely using iterative methods in the optical domains.",

      "abstract": "Spectrum usage in wireless communications has traditionally been very conservative, with each spectrum band at a particular location being constrained to a single owner and usage purpose. Recent developments are, however, pointing toward the freer use of spectrum by a range of users and purposes, providing that those users/purposes agree and that various constraints are maintained. This article investigates dynamic spectrum access by an operator of its range of available spectrum bands as a means to improve power efficiency. The concept is based around three areas of interest: (1) Moving users into particularly active bands to allow radio network equipment in the bands they originated from to be switched off when possible. (2) Dynamic resource allocation in order to opportunistically take advantage of spectrum of more appropriate propagation and reduce necessary transmission power. (3) And dynamic resource allocation to allow channel bandwidths given to users to be increased or more appropriately balanced, thus facilitating transmission power being significantly decreased. Example results are presented, which show a potential for such spectrum management solutions to greatly reduce power consumption by some 50 percent or more, either from-the-mains (i.e. \"guaranteed\" power saving), or more generally in terms of necessary transmission power. It is noted that although the main objective of this article is energy saving, the concepts presented might also be used for other purposes, such as to increase achievable capacity for the operator.",

      "abstract": "The present-day Internet has no separate namespace for host IDs. It uses IP addresses as host IDs, which are in fact locators. This dual role is problematic for mobility, multihoming, security, and routing on the Internet. To solve these problems, research has recently begun on ID/locator split architectures. Some standardization activities based on this concept are also progressing in ITU-T Study Group 13 and in the IETF. We expect that introduction of the ID/locator split concept into the new generation network or future Internet architecture can bring about additional functions, such as heterogeneous network protocol support, multicast, QoS, resource or service discovery, and flexible human-network interaction. Toward realization of these functions, this article discusses some approaches to introducing multi-ID and multilocator support into the network architecture. This also lists items that have the potential to be investigated and standardized in ITU-T.",

The coupling of biosensors with a wireless infrastructure enables the real-time monitoring of an individual's health and related behaviors continuously, as well as the provision of realtime feedback with nimble, adaptive, and personalized interventions. The KNOWME platform is reviewed, and lessons learned from system integration, optimization, and in-field deployment are provided. KNOWME is an endto- end body area sensing system that integrates off-the-shelf sensors with a Nokia N95 mobile phone to continuously monitor and analyze the biometric signals of a subject. KNOWME development by an interdisciplinary team and in-laboratory, as well as in-field deployment studies, employing pediatric obesity as a case study condition to monitor and evaluate physical activity, have revealed four major challenges: (1) achieving robustness to highly varying operating environments due to subject-induced variability such as mobility or sensor placement, (2) balancing the tension between acquiring high fidelity data and minimizing network energy consumption, (3) enabling accurate physical activity detection using a modest number of sensors, and (4) designing WBANs to determine physiological quantities of interest such as energy expenditure. The KNOWME platform described in this article directly addresses these challenges.",

Since LTE-Advanced targets ambitious spectral efficiency and peak throughput, it poses tremendous system design challenges to operators and manufacturers, especially for mobile terminals. This article discusses modem design issues related to carrier aggregation, enhanced ICIC for HetNet, detection of eight-layer transmission, reference signals for enhanced multi-antenna support, and HARQ buffer management. We provide an overview of technical challenges and sketch the perspectives for tackling them to exploit the full benefits of the LTE-Advanced system.",

      "abstract": "LTE-Advanced extends the capabilities originally developed in LTE within the 3GPP. Carrier aggregationis the most significant, albeit complex, improvement provided by LTE-Advanced. Bandwidths from various portions of the spectrum are logically concatenated resulting in a virtual block of a much larger band, enabling increased data throughput. Additionally, enhancements to MIMO antenna techniques in the uplink and downlink further increase the data throughput. Cell coverage is improved by means of relay nodes, which connect to donor eNode-Bs. To cope with the many varieties of cell types and sizes (macro, pico, femto), intercell interference control is enhanced to handle these heterogeneous networks. Operators hope to leverage LTE-Advanced to offer their mobile wireless customers a vastly superior user experience.",

      "abstract": "In IP over WDM multilayer optical networks, IP routers are interconnected by all-optical channels called lightpaths, of typical rates of 10, 40, or, more recently, 100 Gb/s. In this context, lightpath bundling (LB) and anycast switching (AS) are control plane and data plane techniques, respectively, both of them to be implemented in the IP routers. LB permits grouping a set of lightpaths between two nodes that follow a common route so that they are perceived by the IP layer as a single virtual link of aggregated capacity. In its turn, AS consists of instructing the router to implement a per-packet-granularity balancing of the traffic among the lightpaths in the bundle, reducing the packet delay and the buffering requirements in the node. This happens transparently to the IP layer, which, because of the LB configuration, sees the bundled lightpaths as a single entity. In this article, we propose the combined application of the LB and AS techniques as a new paradigm (LB+AS) for optical networks. Applying the LB+AS concept requires seamless changes in the electronic equipment and no changes in the optical infrastructure. We present a case study that shows the significant performance and cost benefits LB+AS can bring to the network and its inherent scalability. In addition, we discuss other potential advantages of LB+AS and related open research lines.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several proposals for informationcentric networks have surfaced and gained traction. Many of these are focused on developing a clean-slate communication architecture to replace the current model based on TCP/IP. In such architectures also the naming of data needs to be rethought. This article discusses the different approaches to naming, based on the expectations that users have about the names, and the properties that are important to network. We show that HTTP could be used as an information-centric transport protocol, and many of the benefits of information-centric networking could be achieved in the current network architecture with small protocol modifications. We also show an architecture based on using information-centric HTTP proxies and discuss some of the expected performance implications of such approach.",

The IEEE NGSON standard has defined a functional architecture that provides advanced overlay functions for value-added services by collaboration of services with features of context awareness, dynamic adaptation and self-organizing management. Its service composition mechanism is comparable with service oriented architecture. However, due to SOA's complexity, it has not become as popular for user-generated services and contents as so-called mashup technologies, which also provide attractive and simple service creation. In this article we propose the adoption of loosely coupled service composition into the NGSON framework that can easily integrate existing communications and data services with little to no dependence on the underlying implementation and service description language details. Furthermore, the NGSON prototype supporting our proposal is presented as a proof of concept and to verify its advantages for operators, service providers, and end users.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, the use of wireless sensor nodes for remote health care monitoring has been advocated as an attractive alternative to the traditional hospital-centric health care system from both the economic perspective and the patient comfort viewpoint. The semiconductor industry plays a crucial role in making the changes in the health care system a reality. User acceptance of remote health monitoring systems depends on their comfort level, among other factors. The comfort level directly translates to the form factor, which is ultimately defined by the battery size and system power consumption. This article introduces low-power wireless sensor nodes for biomedical applications that are capable of operating autonomously or on very small batteries. In particular, we take a closer look at component-level power optimizations for the radio and the digital signal processing core as well as the trade-off between radio power consumption and on-node processing. We also provide a system-level model for WSNs that helps in guiding the power optimization process with respect to various trade-offs.",

      "abstract": "Capturing and replaying real flows are important for testing network security products. However, capturing real flows demands a high storage cost and runs a risk of capture loss, which makes the replay inaccurate. Replaying real flows should be accurate and stateful to adapt to the reaction of the device under test. It should also efficiently reproduce a defect and help developers identify the flows triggering defects. Therefore, this work first presents the (N, M, P) capture scheme which begins with, for each connection, capturing at most N bytes of application payload and then at most M bytes of application payload for at most each of the subsequent P packets in the same connection. This scheme reduces 87 percent of storage cost while retaining 99.74 percent of original events. This work develops a tool named SocketReplay with the mechanisms of loss recovery, stateful replay, and selective replay. Loss recovery tracks TCP sequence numbers to identify capture loss and recovers incomplete flows with dummy data. Stateful replay maintains the states in the TCP/IP stack to replay real flows. Selective replay incrementally selects flows to replay. The results show that SocketReplay can accurately and efficiently reproduce product events and significantly decrease the volume of replayed packet traces.",

To facilitate convergence among these different stakeholders, different standardization groups started working on MTC. This article introduces briefly some of the relevant activities, with a focus on those related to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The article focuses on two important aspects of MTC devices, currently discussed in 3GPP as part of its Release 10. They are subscription control and network congestion/overload control. For the latter, a new solution based on bulk signaling handling is proposed.",

In this article we briefly describe the architectural enhancements in 3GPP systems to better facilitate machine type communication. We highlight key architectural changes, functionality of new network elements to support new features such as device triggering, packet switched subscriptions including short message service via PS domain and SMS in MME. We also describe overload control mechanisms to prevent overload situations caused by synchronous connection requests from large numbers of MTC devices to the 3GPP system. Finally, we discuss how this work is expected to evolve in future 3GPP releases.",

This resource constraint not only applies to memory and processing capabilities, but the low-power radio standards utilized further constrain the network interfaces. The IPv6 protocol provides a suitable basis for interoperability in the IoT, due to its large address space and a number of existing protocols that function over IP and its flexibility. We investigate how existing IP-based network management protocols can be implemented on resource-constrained devices. We present the resource requirements for SNMP and NETCONF on an 8-bit AVR based device.",

      "abstract": "Mobile data traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years due to the explosive growth of mobile web and video traffic on smartphones. Wireless operators have invested heavily to make infrastructural improvements by installing new cell towers and offloading cellular data traffic to Wi-Fi to resolve congestion. They are also exploring the use of behavioral and economic interventions to manage congestion. To understand the role of interventions, we distributed smartphones to students at Purdue University, loaded with applications to perform monitoring and location tracking with user consent. We conducted two experiments: first with 14 phones of one type, then with 30 phones of two types. Wi-Fi traffic and cellular network data usage were collected and analyzed to characterize and quantify the changes in usage behaviors; the second experiment also captured location data during compliance/non-compliance to incentive messages. The trial seeks not only to experiment with incentives and disincentives to observe their effectiveness, but also to understand current mobile broadband and Wi-Fi usage behaviors in a campus environment. Our results indicate a high level of compliance with economic incentives and disincentives. Detailed analysis further showed correlation with two psychological measures of each user (agreeableness and neuroticism). In addition, we found schemes with probabilistic payments of higher incentive amounts getting more positive results compared to schemes with definite payments with lower incentive amounts, despite similar total payout.",

However, in the increasingly complex wireless packet data networks of today, performance is affected by many different factors and cannot easily be estimated by simple radio measurements. Therefore, in 3GPP Release 11 specifications, MDT is enhanced in order to provide a more complete view of network performance. This article describes the MDT enhancements added in Release 11, explains how measurements collected by MDT can be used to draw conclusions that are relevant for network management, and discusses similarities and differences between MDT and traditional drive tests.",

      "abstract": "Providing network coverage and quality of service (QoS) is an important task of a cellular network operator. This is because cellular spectrum is normally licensed under certain coverage obligations, and operators need to be competitive in market. To improve their networks, operators often send engineers in the field to collect radio measurements, to discover problems such as coverage holes in the network, and to determine whether certain parameter tuning is needed. However, such conventional \"drive tests\" require large Operation Expenditure (OPEX), while the collected measurements can only give limited snap shots of the entire network. In their Release 10 (Rel-10) specification, 3GPP studied and specified solutions to reduce this OPEX for drive tests, under the work item named \u201cMinimization of Drive Tests (MDT).\" The solution utilizes the user (customer) equipments (UEs) to collect field measurements, including radio measurements and location information. This article describes in details the solution adopted in 3GPP MDT; how they were developed and intended to be used.",

In this context, mobile application stores have revolutionized software and content delivery. These stores focus on the applications, building around them an ecosystem of developers and consumers. The store greatly lessens the barrier between these agents, providing significant benefits to both developers and consumers. In this article we analyze this phenomenon, describing its originating factors and fundamental characteristics. We also perform a more detailed study on the two most successful application stores, identifying different approaches to implementing the model.",

Mobile cellular networks (MCN) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) are evolving from heterogeneous networks to converged networks, in order to support M2M communications. In this article, we investigate and discuss key technical challenges and opportunities for the convergence of MCN and WSN. We propose that the mobile terminals in MCN act as both sensor nodes and gateways for WSN in the converged networks. We evaluated the performance gain, and our simulation results show that better system performance, in terms of throughput, delay, and network lifetime, can be achieved in WSN by using interactive optimization with MCN.",

In this line, we evaluate the mobility performance of HetNets with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release-10 range expansion and enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) features such as almost blank subframes (ABSFs). Simulation assumptions and parameters of a related study item in 3GPP are used to investigate the impact of various handover parameters on mobility performance. In addition, we propose a mobility-based inter-cell interference coordination (MB-ICIC) scheme, in which picocells configure coordinated resources so that macrocells can schedule their high-mobility UEs in these resources without co-channel interference from picocells. MB-ICIC also benefits low-mobility UEs, since handover parameters can now be more flexibly optimized. Simulations using the 3GPP simulation assumptions are performed to evaluate the performance of MB-ICIC under several scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Growing concerns regarding the scalability of current optical networks as well as IP-based networks are driving two important trends. One trend is a shift from the current rigid optical networks to spectrally efficient elastic optical networks with a flexible bandwidth and adaptive channel spacing. The other trend is IP traffic offloading to a lower layer yielding benefits that are potentially cost-effective and power-efficient. This article presents a novel multiflow optical transponder (OTP) that enables more efficient IP optical networking. A multiflow OTP allows client data flows that arrive from a single client interface to be mapped to multiple optical flows. In cooperation with the emerging spectrally efficient elastic optical path networking technology, multiflow OTPs can provide multiple optical connections from a single OTP to multiple OTPs. IP traffic offloading to an elastic optical path layer architecture and the effect of introducing multiflow OTPs (i.e., the potential reduction in the number of router interfaces and considerable potential for cost savings) are discussed. These benefits are brought about by increasing the number of directly connected router pairs while keeping router-to-optical-node interconnections simple. A novel optical virtual private line service based on multiflow OTPs that supports multiple optical connections from a single customer site to multiple customer sites with capacity adjustment is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming prevalent in tactical networks as they are proving to be an extremely flexible platform for a variety of applications. Increasingly, UAVs need to cooperate with each other in order to perform complex tasks such as target monitoring and prosecution, information gathering and processing, and delivery between disconnected portions of the network. However, UAV cooperation in tactical scenarios represents a major challenge from both the coordination and communication perspectives. In fact, cooperating UAVs must achieve a high degree of coordination in order to accomplish complex tasks in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In turn, as UAVs interact with other entities, the effective coordination of multiple-UAV operations requires specific support in terms of efficient communication protocols and mechanisms exploiting UAVs as mobile assets that facilitate and hasten critical information flows. This article presents a series of considerations and lessons learned that we have collected in our experience with multiple- UAV coordination and communications in tactical edge networks, and discusses some of the main components of a middleware we specifically designed to support multiple-UAV operations.",

      "abstract": "There have been several efforts to provide service-aware technologies in the networks, such as the service-oriented architecture and service delivery platform. These technologies were integrated with service overlay network (SON) infrastructure to support control and delivery of services over multiple network domains. However, SON has limitations in handling the increasing needs of a ubiquitous and dynamic environment of users and services. To provide better quality of experience to users in this ubiquitous and dynamic environment, next-generation SON (NGSON) was introduced to support context-aware, dynamically adaptive, and selforganizing capabilities in SON. In this article, we present an overall description of the concept of NGSON, and provide a comprehensive review of the recent standardization activities related to NGSON. By visiting our experiences in designing and developing a prototype for NGSON, the challenges and opportunities of NGSON are described.",

      "abstract": "Markets for network resources have become increasingly important. Such resources include bandwidth in wireline networks to wireless spectrum. It is clear that if the markets are not properly designed, they can function rather poorly, even leading to market failure. This then leads to suboptimal use of network resources. In this article, we present the game theoretic framework behind the market design principles for network resources. We present some of the extant work on network market mechanisms in the context of wireline networks in part I. Part II [1] relates to network market design in the context of wireless systems. We also discuss some of the key challenges for the future.",

Part I of this article introduced the game theoretic underpinnings of market design and argued for the need to jointly consider market design with the underlying engineering issues in communication networks.

In this part, we turn to network market design for wireless systems and in particular for the flexible sharing of wireless spectrum. We use this as a vehicle for discussing challenges that arise in the design of markets in the presence of externalities.",

A number of articles propose that certain benefits can be realized by virtualizing links between network elements as well as adding virtualization on intermediate network elements. In this article we argue that network virtualization may bring nothing new in terms of technical capabilities and theoretical performance, but it provides a way of organizing networks such that it is possible to overcome some of the practical issues in today\u00bfs Internet. We strengthen our case by an analogy between the concept of network virtualization as it is currently presented in research, and machine virtualization as proven useful in deployments in recent years. First we make an analogy between the functionality of an operating system and that of a network, and identify similar concepts and elements. Then we emphasize the practical benefits realized by machine virtualization, and we exploit the analogy to derive potential benefits brought by network virtualization. We map the established applications for machine virtualization to network virtualization, thus identifying possible use cases for network virtualization. We also use this analogy to structure the design space for network virtualization.",

We propose the use of a QoS broker device to enhance the QoS in the smart grid electrical distribution access domains by providing a centralization of QoS management. Our proposal takes decisions based on current network data traffic flows, existing QoS policies and customer service level agreements and facilitates interoperability with other technology domains in order to achieve seamless end-to-end QoS. The key feature of this end-toend QoS control is the mapping of QoS parameters mainly between broadband power line and wireless technologies that principally serve the distribution smart grid but it can be applied to other communication technologies as well.",

      "abstract": "In the last two decades, digital television terrestrial broadcasting (DTTB) systems have been deployed worldwide. With the approval of the fourth DTTB standard called Digital Television/ Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) by International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in December 2011, the research on first-generation DTTB standards is coming to an end. Recently, with the rapid progress of advanced signal processing technologies, nextgeneration DTTB systems like Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial-Second Generation (DVB-T2) have been extensively studied and developed to provide more types of services with higher spectral efficiency and better performance. This article starts from the brief review of the first-generation DTTB standards and the current status of emerging second-generation DTTB systems, then focuses on the common key technologies behind them instead of describing the specific techniques adopted by various standards. The state-of-the-art, technical challenges, and the most recent achievements in the field are addressed. The future research trends are discussed as well. In addition, the scheme of integrating DTTB and Internet is proposed to solve the crucial problem of information expansion.",

      "abstract": "If predictions of consumer usage of high-bandwidth \"on-net\" services and behavioral changes are realized, the network that delivers these services must be significantly more reliable and future-proof than currently achievable to meet customers' expectations. Fiber plant infrastructure constitutes the biggest single cost item in FTTx deployments and represents a major barrier for rolling out resilient fiber access network configurations. This article proposes how, with an incremental cost to typical FTTx infrastructure deployments, a new duct network architecture can be implemented, enabling the deployment of resilient access networks, which dissolves the artificial demarcations of central office boundaries and removes the distinction between the backhaul/metro and access domains. This article describes how the proposed infrastructure architecture would be implemented in practice and preliminary results that demonstrate the low risk for the network operator to realize this proposal, which offers significant benefits.",

Providing improved link spectral efficiencies and maintaining long communication range, these new radios enable an opportunity to utilize mult-hop networking features that have been developed for mobile ad hoc networks during the past decade. The challenge, however, is to select and devise networking solutions of predictable and robust performance. For this purpose, a network-science- based approach is taken to first capture and understand the fundamental network properties exhibited when connecting tactical radios. This application of an empirical foundation has proven effective in discovering the dynamic network topological behavior and connectivity attributes. The results illustrate critical implications on the network protocol design and provide important guidance on selecting required networking solutions.",

In order to achieve high spectrum efficiency in the DAS, frequency reuse is considered. In this article, two values of frequency reuse factor are considered in conjunction with cooperative spatial diversity. In order to show the advantage of introducing frequency reuse, the performance of the DAS with frequency reuse is compared with that without frequency reuse. Results show that the DAS with frequency reuse outperforms the DAS without frequency reuse in the average spectrum efficiency per sector and the cell edge spectrum efficiency. The DAS with larger frequency reuse factor outperforms the DAS with smaller frequency reuse factor for a large range of signal-to- noise ratio.",

As a result, regulators around the world have been working on technical measures that will allow the use of this spectrum without interfering with incumbent licensed users. Defining these measures is complex and can have major implications on the amount of white space actually available. This article looks at a number of aspects of defining, using and regulating white space and shows which parameters are critical. It compares regulatory approaches put forward in the UK and US and demonstrates how the current US approach results in much restricted spectrum access. It also assesses key factors for the technologies using white space and shows how all these factors influence the applications most likely to succeed.",

      "abstract": "The plain old telephone service, POTS, still generates the largest proportion of public network operators' revenues. If optical communications systems are to compete with traditional twisted-pair copper systems in delivering telephony, they must achieve the same levels of cost and service availability, offer low-risk investment in optical fiber infrastructure, and satisfy the same regulatory requirements. Interferometic optical communications system can meet these requirements, in which the laser in the CPE is replaced by an interferometer for the outgoing voice channel, and part of the received optical power is converted to electrical power using photovoltaic cells and an energy storage device to drive the CPE. The reach of the system is similar to locally powered laser systems in the downstream direction, but back reflections and scattering can affect the upstream link if the communications and powering signals share the same path.",

The algorithms termed in abstract network models have been converted to protocols and architectures practically applicable to wireless systems. A validation methodology through experimental protocol evaluation in real network testbeds has been proposed and used. OPNEX uses recent advances in system theoretic network control, including the Back-Pressure principle, max-weight scheduling, utility optimization, congestion control, and the primaldual method for extracting network algorithms. These approaches exhibited vast potential for achieving high capacity and full exploitation of resources in abstract network models and found their way to reality in high performance architectures developed as a result of the research conducted within OPNEX.",

In this article, we do a detailed comparison of the implementation of OFDMA in LTE and WiMAX. The multiuser diversity advantage of OFDMA is well used in LTE, whereas the frequency diversity advantage is nicely exploited in WiMAX. The physical layer overhead in LTE is significantly better than in WiMAX. The network entry process of an LTE mobile is simpler than in a WiMAX mobile. In addition, LTE systems are expected to react faster to changes in the traffic and channel conditions due to the smaller frame times. However, the OFDMA design in WiMAX will cater for more extreme channel conditions, which is perhaps more than what is expected in practice as our investigation reveals.",

To bridge the gap between the variable performance and demanding application needs, it is imperative to measure and characterize the LSP provisioning performance. In this article, we introduce the ongoing activities in IETF on defining standardized metrics and measurement methodologies for GMPLS/MPLS-TE performance. We also present our experiences in testing a number of GMPLS networks. The results can be seen as a sketch of performances of current state-of-the-art GMPLS implementations. We further point out possible future work in this area.",

Current limitations and shortcomings of the Internet architecture are driving research trends at a global scale toward a novel, secure, and flexible architecture. This Future Internet architecture must allow for the co-existence and cooperation of multiple networks on common platforms, through the virtualization of network resources. Possible solutions embrace a full range of technologies, from fiber backbones to wireless access networks. The virtualization of physical networking resources will enhance the possibility of handling different profiles, while providing the impression of mutual isolation. This abstraction strategy implies the use of well elaborated mechanisms in order to deal with channel impairments and requirements, in both wireless (access) and optical (core) environments.",

      "abstract": "The smart grid is characterized by the two-way flow of electric power and information. For the information flow implementation and support, several wireless communication technologies and standards are being considered. Although there is no doubt that using wireless communications offers significant benefits over wired connections, the wireless technology introduces additional vulnerability in terms of network security. This work addresses physical layer security, a topic that has been hardly investigated in the smart grid domain. To understand new types of threats, we review fundamentals of wireless communication and examine physical attack models in depth. As a promising solution to physical security, we describe a random spread-spectrum based wireless communication scheme that can achieve both fast and robust data transmission. We expect that the work presented here will advance the research on wireless smart grid security.",

      "abstract": "The role of the ICT sector in our daily life is causing a significant growth of the power consumed by the network equipment. In this context, transparent WDM networks represent a promising solution for reducing the power consumption of telecom networks. For this reason transparent WDM networks attract a lot of interest and several power-aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms are available in the literature. These approaches, however, seem to consider power minimization as the only parameter to be optimized. Little or no attention is given to other important network aspects, e.g., connection requests blocking. Such approaches may not always be advisable, especially in core WDM networks where high performance levels must be considered in the first place. This article aims at providing a different insight to the PA-routing problem. It follows the intuition that in some cases relaxing the power minimization constraint can have beneficial effects on the overall network performance, especially on the blocking probability. A novel approach, referred to as Weighted Power-Aware Lightpath Routing (WPA-LR), is proposed and evaluated using two continental core networks. Our results confirm the presence of a trade-off between power savings and blocking probability.",

Flow termination is a new flow control function that terminates some admitted flows when the network capacity does not suffice, such as in the case of unexpected failures. Admission control and flow termination are useful to protect QoS for inelastic flows that require a minimum bit rate. Examples are real-time applications like voice and video. Precongestion notification (PCN) provides feedback about load conditions on the path to boundary nodes. They use this information to implement lightweight admission control and flow termination without per-flow state on interior nodes of a domain. These mechanisms are significantly simpler than explicit reservation schemes. In the context of DiffServ, IP, MPLS, and Ethernet networks, we explain the concept of PCN-based admission control and flow termination, present recent standards of the IETF, and discuss benefits and limitations.",

As a result, vulnerabilities in network protocol implementations can be exploited with Internet hacking tools to cause denial-of-service and distributed denial of service situations. Fuzzing is a black-box testing technique originally used by crackers to find exploitable vulnerabilities. In this article, we demonstrate how specification-based fuzzers can be used to discover exploitable vulnerabilities proactively to make networks and devices more robust against DoS and DDoS attacks.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid is considered to be the next generation power system. Integrating information and communication technology, power electronics, and power system technologies, smart grid reduces excess power generation by better matching power generation with customer demands, and facilitates renewable power generation by closely monitoring renewable energy source status. Such a large-scale network may be subject to various attacks. In particular, authentication and user privacy preservation are considered two major security concerns. In this article, we first highlight the importance of smart grid security. Next we introduce a new power request paradigm in which a customer is allowed to submit a power usage plan in advance. We then propose a secure and privacy-preserving power request scheme as a solution to this problem. To achieve the privacy-preserving property, our scheme employs two cryptographic techniques: anonymous credential and blind signature. We conclude this article by discussing the security and performance issues of our proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid is a new emerging technology which is able to intelligently control the power consumption via network. Therefore, the efficiency of the information exchange between the power suppliers (or control centers) and power customers is an important issue for smart grid. Moreover, the performance of the smart grid usually depends on the customer's satisfaction degree which belongs to the field of quality of experience. In this article, we propose a QoE-driven power scheduling in the context of smart grid from the perspectives of architecture, strategy, and methodology. Specifically, it takes into account the QoE requirement when designing the power allocation scheme. For obtaining the QoE requirement, we analyze the fluctuation of the power load and the impact of the transmission delay. In particular, the power allocation is formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the social welfare of the system. Based on the given QoE model, an efficient power scheduling scheme is proposed by jointly considering the admission control and QoE expectation. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can efficiently allocate the power according to the dynamic QoE requirements in a practical smart grid system.",

      "abstract": "The growing consumer demand for mobile video services is one of the key drivers of the evolution of new wireless multimedia solutions requiring exploration of new ways to optimize future wireless networks for video services towards delivering enhanced quality of experience (QoE). One of these key video enhancing solutions is HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS), which has recently been spreading as a form of Internet video delivery and is expected to be deployed more broadly over the next few years. As a relatively new technology in comparison with traditional push-based adaptive streaming techniques, deployment of HAS presents new challenges and opportunities for content developers, service providers, network operators and device manufacturers. One of these important challenges is developing evaluation methodologies and performance metrics to accurately assess user QoE for HAS services, and effectively utilizing these metrics for service provisioning and optimizing network adaptation. In that vein, this article provides an overview of HAS concepts, and reviews the recently standardized QoE metrics and reporting framework in 3GPP. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end QoE evaluation study on HAS conducted over 3GPP LTE networks and conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities in QoE optimization for HAS services.",

      "abstract": "The so-called TV white spaces (TVWS) are locally underutilized portions of the terrestrial TV bands and occur as a by-product of the digital switchover taking place in most countries across the globe. Thanks to the very good characteristics of the TV bands in terrestrial radio communications, the exploitation of TVWS for local- or regional-area wireless license-exempt networking, under a carefully established regulatory framework, is a very attractive prospect. This article presents a generic methodology for determining the actual capacity of white spaces using a geolocation-based approach, that is, dynamic assignment of radio resources to TVWS networks according to their geographical location. This methodology is applied in a case study investigating a sample area in southeastern Europe and unveils a significant amount of access capacity that can be unleashed via TVWS exploitation.",

The key specifications driving the development of RF DAC technology are reviewed, as are some common radio architectures used to implement those systems. Challenges associated with the design of RF DACs are described, and some trade-offs and possible solutions are discussed. Design considerations of the package and the printed circuit board design are reviewed. Measured results of an RF DAC suitable for cable head-end transmitters are presented. The features and performance of RF DACs provide an enabling solution for software defined radio systems targeted toward multicarrier, multiband, multistandard radio transmitters.",

To support such a large number of autonomous devices, the M2M system architecture needs to be extremely power and spectrally efficient. This article thus briefly reviews the features of M2M services in the third generation (3G) long-term evolution and its advancement (LTE-Advanced) networks. Architectural enhancements are then presented for supporting M2M services in LTE-Advanced cellular networks. To increase spectral efficiency, the same spectrum is expected to be utilized for human-to- human (H2H) communications as well as M2M communications. We therefore present various radio resource allocation schemes and quantify their utility in LTE-Advanced cellular networks. System-level simulation results are provided to validate the performance effectiveness of M2M communications in LTE-Advanced cellular networks.",

      "abstract": "Tactical wireless and mobile networks are the primary networking infrastructure in the Global Information Grid (GIG) to provide end-to-end connectivity to the warfighters at the tactical edge. The highly dynamic nature of tactical edge networks raise a number of challenging issues related to data transport and service delivery in the tactical environment. To address some of these issues, DoD waveforms have increasingly leveraged layer 2 link information to make smart cross-layer multihop routing decisions. Although there has been some measure of success in providing higher end-to-end data delivery, the lack of standard interfaces between the radio and router have led to interoperability issues in environments with a heterogeneous mix of radio systems. As a result, there has been increased desire to standardize radio-to-router interfaces (R2RIs) as a means to separate radio and router functionality and to allow greater interoperability between systems. In this article, we examine three R2RI protocols currently being vetted through the Internet Engineering Task Force and currently integrated or under consideration in DoD radio systems (RFC 5578, R2CP, and DLEP), and identify their current use and applicability in the tactical edge. Furthermore, we identify some challenges in implementing any R2RI scheme into emerging systems.",

      "abstract": "Keeping students acclimatized with the increasingly rapid advancement in technology requires major changes in the manner in which education is designed and conducted. With the utilization of more sophisticated equipment in the classroom and laboratory, students are better exposed to real-world design techniques and multidisciplinary problem-solving, providing a positive link between education and industry. Much of the impetus for this change is the availability of more affordable and easy to use microcontrollers and embedded systems, including reconfigurable multipurpose hardware platforms. At the heart of this paradigm shift is the proliferation of Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs), and the growth of system-on-a-chip (SOC) design. SOC designs facilitate innovation by incorporating the speed of dedicated hardware and memory with the flexibility of general purpose processors on a single chip. The use of this reprogrammable high-speed platform helps students reach a stage of true emancipation, combining their coursework knowledge in a more holistic engineering approach. In this article, we discuss the benefits of the reconfigurable highspeed platform in academia. By enhancing information sharing and collaboration between research and education, undergraduate students can gain more exposure to cutting edge research. In addition, the use of this platform for research prototyping serves to enhance the visibility of research projects to the industrial community. We illustrate how this platform can be co-opted into current practices via several case studies and the associated benefits that can be gained.",

      "abstract": "A new paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare characterized by pervasive continuous vital sign data collection, real-time processing of monitored data to derive meaningful physiological parameters, and context-aware data- and patient-centric decision making, is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, this article presents an innovative resource provisioning framework that organizes and harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., laptops, tablets, PDAs, DVRs, medical terminals) in home and hospital settings. Novel wireless communication solutions for reliable vital sign transmission and algorithms for acquiring context awareness to support this framework are also discussed.",

In this article, we look at the motivation behind the EPON protection schemes from a network operator perspective, as well as ways of delivering increased data service availability while minimizing the impact on the network cost and complexity. We also examine mechanisms used in EPON for link fault detection, spanning from physical through logical to link layers.",

      "abstract": "Responsive communications jamming is an emerging technology for electronic-warfare applications. In contrast to state-of-the-art barrage jammers, which continuously jam entire frequency bands irrespective of current signal activities, responsive jammers regularly perform wideband scans of the radio spectrum and are thus able to react to observed signals. By this means, the available transmit energy can be focused on currently relevant spectral areas, which potentially leads to significantly improved jamming efficiencies. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of this jamming technology with focus on vehicle- or convoy-protection jamming against radio-controlled improvised explosive devices (RCIEDs). Bringing in experience from our product development as well as from theoretical studies, we discuss various system design aspects of responsive anti-RCIED jammers and point out the main technological challenges. In particular, the issues of jam-duration optimization and time synchronization of multiple responsive jammers are discussed in some detail.",

      "abstract": "Sleep scheduling is a widely used strategy for saving the energy of sensor nodes and prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN). The lower the duty cycle is, the longer the network lifetime will be. However, sleep scheduling brings great challenges to the design of efficient distributed routing protocols for multi-hop duty-cycled WSNs. This issue has attracted much attention and various routing protocols have been proposed. In this article we first summarize the fundamental issues in the design of routing protocols for such networks, and then classify existing protocols based on different design criteria. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art routing protocols in this area. We illustrate how different protocols work and discuss their merits and deficiencies. Finally, we point out some future directions for routing in duty-cycled wireless sensor networks.",

In hybrid clouds, jobs can be allocated on either a private cloud or a public cloud on a pay per use basis. The capacity of the communication channels connecting these two types of resources impacts the makespan and the cost of workflow execution. This article introduces the scheduling problem in hybrid clouds presenting the main characteristics to be considered when scheduling workflows, as well as a brief survey of some of the scheduling algorithms used in these systems. To assess the influence of communication channels on job allocation, we compare and evaluate the impact of the available bandwidth on the performance of some of the scheduling algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we discuss a spectrum trading mechanism implemented by the spectrum broker in TV whitespaces. TVWS are spectrum frequency bands unused by DTV, interleaved in both frequency and space. Underutilization of these bands results from the fact that the DTV transmission systems now operational in the spectrum from 470 to 790 MHz are multifrequency systems employing high tower and high power network geometries, and must be managed for interference between transmitters. We motivate the use of a spectrum broker, an entity that manages the TVWS secondary spectrum market. Such a TVWS broker's responsibilities include planning the possible broad uses of the available spectrum in the TVWS; packaging the spectrum for short-term disposal through trading mechanisms; serving the broker's customers, with spectrum-leasing contracts; and acting as the port of call to handle interference caused by its customers to the primary DTV systems or between its customers themselves. We discuss the spectrum broker's merchant and auction modes for spectrum trading. In the merchant mode, the base price is decided by the allocation procedure, which considers various factors influencing the value of TVWS in a given place. In the auction mode, the customers' demands and bids decide the final price of the spectrum. We discuss the auction design and show results of the spectrum trading mechanisms, which have been successfully applied in a real-world test scenario in the area of Munich, Germany.",

At the same time, the involvement of service providers brings a new set of security threats to the smart grid. In this article, we first identify the cyber security challenges on service provision in the smart grid. Then we present two main security issues related to service provision and provide potential solutions. The first one is to establish a secure communication procedure among the electric utility, consumers, and service providers. The second one is to provide a privacy-preserving yet accountable authentication framework among the smart grid entities without relying on any trusted third party. Finally, we suggest directions of future work on secure service provision by describing several open issues.",

      "abstract": "Current transportation systems are emitting a considerable amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. The recent advances in the fuel cell battery is making the zero-carbon electric vehicle (EV) increasingly practical for the commercial market. However, mass use of EVs requires support from a powerful and robust power grid that can efficiently generate, aggregate, and distribute a large amount of energy in real time with low carbon emission. Such a system calls for the application of modern communication technologies that inherently suffer from various cyber attacks. Attacks against the communication system in smart grid can cause catastrophic damage to the highly interdependent smart grid users. In this article, we first propose a smart grid model for supporting mass EV use, then introduce some typical security issues in the communication system, especially for the wireless security in such a smart grid. We mainly introduce two types of security protocols: key agreement from wireless channel estimation and jamming-resilient communication.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid has emerged as the next-generation power grid via the convergence of power system engineering and information and communication technology. In this article, we describe smart grid goals and tactics, and present a threelayer smart grid network architecture. Following a brief discussion about major challenges in smart grid development, we elaborate on smart grid cyber security issues. We define a taxonomy of basic cyber attacks, upon which sophisticated attack behaviors may be built. We then introduce fundamental security techniques, whose integration is essential for achieving full protection against existing and future sophisticated security attacks. By discussing some interesting open problems, we finally expect to trigger more research efforts in this emerging area.",

Due to the robots' potential to unleash a wider set of networking means and thus augment the network performance, WSRNs have rapidly become a hot research area.

The former deals with robots cooperatively deciding on the set of tasks to be individually carried out to achieve a desired goal; the latter enables robots to fulfill the assigned tasks through intelligent mobility scheduling.",

We consider these criteria separately and show that the new emerging large-volume markets loosely defined as Computercom will demand new standards and new technologies. We discuss how the balance between single-channel bit rate, and number of wavelength multiplexed and spatially multiplexed optical channels can help to satisfy the need for huge total bandwidth, while keeping cost low and power efficiency high. Silicon CMOS-integrated photonics holds promise to become a technology of choice for wide deployment of low-power and cost-effective optical interconnects for these new markets, and to become a single solution addressing distances spanning from just a meter to 10km.",

      "abstract": "The operations of a smart grid heavily rely on the support of communication infrastructures for efficient electricity management and reliable power distribution. Due to the strong dependency, the robustness of a smart grid communication network against attack is of the utmost importance for the deployment of the smart grid. Notably, the large scale and autonomous features of a smart grid render its cyber security quite vulnerable to adversaries. In this article, we introduce several intelligent attacks and countermeasures in smart grid communication networks, which aim for maximal damage or benefits by taking advantage of the network structure as well as the protocol functionality. We adopt the percolation-based connectivity in statistic mechanics to quantitatively analyze the network robustness. If the attack and defense strategies are involved, the attack can be further smart and complicated. Consequently, a twoplayer zero-sum game is introduced between the adversary and the defender, and the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the performance of defense mechanisms with different network configurations. This article therefore offers novel insights and comprehensive analysis on the cyber security of a smart grid.",

      "abstract": "We explore whether public data networks called SocialMesh - formed automatically from smartphone radio-routers and adapting to changing RF propagation and interference without relying on managed cellular infrastructure - can also be designed to overcome any and all countermeasures mounted by an attacker and reliably support social applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google. We rigorously examine the architecture, techniques and algorithms that make decentralized or \"ad-hoc,\" ultrawideband networks work in the presence of hostile jamming or protocol attacks. We illustrate the RF link-budget using 3-d graphs to show how interference affects the network performance as these networks become heavily utilized or jammed. Using low-cost hardware, self-organizing routing software, and uncoordinated/distributed CDMA we show how they can retain adequate system capacity even under heavy load from users or interference from jammers. Open standardization and field trials of SocialMesh networks will further clarify SocialMesh security and performance by opening up the design specifications to international review. Open-source design specifications for SocialMesh will be updated at http://www.socialmesh.org.",

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing people demand for mobile communications has widely been satisfied by novel socially-enabled services and communication styles, starting from the advent of instant messaging to Voice over IP (VoIP), from Web 2.0 to social networks, and beyond. Most people agree that now the new challenge is to explore the potential of that immense information and service deposit already collected, ever-increasing, and easy-to-access to promote a socially-aware recommendation and to foster a more efficient delivery of mobile services. The article addresses the above issues, still unexplored in literature, by focusing on integration problems and describing a practical design experience derived from the development of a socio-technical aware support for the management of mobile services based on the widely diffused and interoperable IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session control platform. Our proposal is organized along three main original technical guidelines: an innovative support to monitor and describe via social, physical, and computation information the sociotechnical context where services and user interact; a recommendation system to automate and facilitate dynamic selection of the mobile services most suitable from both final user and operator perspectives; and a new IMS-based management platform to ease the composition of existing IMS mobile services and the monitoring and control of their usage at runtime. We believe that we contribute with a first step to the understanding of how full awareness of socio and technical information allows improving overall Quality of Experience (QoE) for the final users.",

So long as in highly dynamic environments, the secondary user (SU) communication is often interrupted, spectrum mobility is a key feature enabling continuous SU data transmission. Namely, SU performs spectrum handoff by transferring ongoing communication to a vacant channel. This article discusses some important features of spectrum mobility in CRNs. Qualitative comparison of various handoff strategies is considered with regard to handoff latency. Furthermore, essential design issues and associated research challenges are also addressed.",

However, interference due to nonlinear electric power equipment and fading as a result of obstacles in various smart grid environments from generation to end-user sides make realization of reliable and energy-efficient communication a challenging task for WSNs in smart grid. In this article, spectrum-aware and cognitive sensor networks (SCSNs) are proposed to overcome spatio-temporally varying spectrum characteristics and harsh environmental conditions for WSN-based smart grid applications. Specifically, potential advantages, application areas, and protocol design principles of SCSN are introduced. The existing communication protocols and algorithms devised for dynamic spectrum management networks and WSNs are discussed along with the open research issues for the fulfillment of SCSNs. A case study is also presented to reveal the reliable transport performance in SCSNs for different smart grid environments. Lastly, different energy harvesting techniques for SCSN-based smart grid applications are reviewed. Here, our goal is to envision potentials of SCSNs for reliable and low-cost remote monitoring solutions for smart grid.",

      "abstract": "Traditional ITU-T fixed frequency grid-based optical transport networks suffer several drawbacks such as low fiber spectral efficiency, difficulty in supporting large-bandwidth super-channels, and inflexibility in network bandwidth reconfiguration and modification. To overcome these drawbacks, a new-generation optical transport network based on the concepts of agile spectrum operation and elastic bandwidth allocation has been recently proposed and is receiving increasing attention. This new-generation network is called coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) optical transport network. It employs the promising CO-OFDM transmission technique and the new-generation bandwidth-variable ROADMs that use the coherent detection capability of the CO-OFDM transmission for optical channel filtering. The CO-OFDM optical transport network is characterized by arbitrarily assigning center frequency and bandwidth of an optical channel, thereby providing flexibility in network design and operation and achieving efficient fiber spectrum utilization. Despite the increasing attention and considerable progress, there are still many outstanding issues regarding the implementation of CO-OFDM optical transport networks. This article reviews the literature on the architectures of the CO-OFDM optical transport network and discusses key issues, particularly involving network control plane, lightpath routing and spectrum assignment, impact of channel modulation format and optical reach, subwavelength traffic grooming, network survivability, and network reconfiguration.",

      "abstract": "False positives and false negatives happen to every intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system. This work proposes a mechanism for false positive/negative assessment with multiple IDSs/IPSs to collect FP and FN cases from real-world traffic and statistically analyze these cases. Over a period of 16 months, more than 2000 FPs and FNs have been collected and analyzed. From the statistical analysis results, we obtain three interesting findings. First, more than 92.85 percent of false cases are FPs even if the numbers of attack types for FP and FN are similar. That is mainly because the behavior of applications or the format of the application content is self-defined; that is, there is not complete conformance to the specifications of RFCs. Accordingly, when this application meets an IDS/IPS with strict detection rules, its traffic will be regarded as malicious traffic, resulting in a lot of FPs. Second, about 91 percent of FP alerts, equal to about 85 percent of false cases, are not related to security issues, but to management policy. For example, some companies and campuses limit or forbid their employees and students from using peer-to-peer applications; therefore, in order to easily detect P2P traffic, an IDS/IPS is configured to be sensitive to it. Hence, this causes alerts to be triggered easily regardless of whether the P2P application has malicious traffic or not. The last finding shows that buffer overflow, SQL server attacks, and worm slammer attacks account for 93 percent of FNs, even though they are aged attacks. This indicates that these attacks always have new variations to evade IDS/IPS detection.",

Although this data is a key asset of telecommunication network operators, it is seldom fully exploited. This article proposes a novel architecture to enable the provisioning of new value-added services, based on subscriber data. This architecture uses semantic web to build a knowledge base from the subscriber data available in individual telecommunication networks. KBs are then federated across telecommunication networks to provide a single and unified interface to service providers for accessing the different KBs. The article also illustrates the use of the proposed architecture in a concrete scenario, and presents a proof-of-concept prototype.",

      "abstract": "As traffic demands continue to grow, supporting data rates beyond 100 Gb/s will be required to increase optical channel capacity and support higher-rate client interfaces. Advanced modulation formats that adapt to optimize spectral efficiency over a range of channel signal-tonoise ratio conditions are required. Channels can be constructed by varying parameters such as symbol rate, bits per symbol, number of polarizations, and number of optical and electrical subcarriers. Channel capacity can also be increased using advanced techniques such as optical time-division multiplexing, and fibers that support multiple cores and modes. Many channel designs can support higher data rates, but there are trade-offs between complexity, spectral efficiency, and optical reach.",

We have developed a testbed to affirm the functions of a heterogeneous radio network, which has abilities to select one system from multiple communication systems and to aggregate multiple systems. First of all, we introduce the activities in the ITU-R and DYSPAN, where the cognitive radio system is under discussion, and clarify the standpoint of our research regarding the heterogeneous radio network. Subsequently, we state the function and specification of the testbed developed. Some experimental results using the testbed are introduced. The testbed is composed of three different communication systems, a controlling system for selecting or aggregating the most appropriate system for the user terminal and networks, and its measurement system. The measurement system is a kind of link simulator to confirm the performance of the controlling system. We also describe an analytical example of evaluating the performance improvement by heterogeneous network controlling. Finally, we address some essential future study issues for practical realization of the heterogeneous radio network.",

      "abstract": "The ubiquity and familiarity of Ethernet has caused a surge of interest in convergence technologies over Ethernet. In order for some applications to migrate to an Ethernet network, enhancements needed to be made in the form of data center bridging (DCB). DCB consists of both point-to-point protocols as well as end-toend protocols that all need to be tested to ensure vendors' products work together in a heterogeneous environment to prevent frame loss during congestion. This article discusses what each of the four protocols is and how to test the protocols separately as well as in combination in order to observe the interactions of DCB with different applications. The information provided in this article is drawn from the authors' experience testing DCB over the past three years and in 13 different industry wide interoperability events.",

      "abstract": "In a short time, IEEE EPON has progressed from initial trials to a market-leading optical access technology that supports business and residential services, including IPTV, VoIP, commercial- grade data services, and cellular backhaul. Due to EPON's simplicity and flexibility, various standards development organizations have embarked on standardization projects aimed at integrating EPON with existing network architectures. Also, several network operators have developed EPON solutions that address their specific deployment environments or relevant regulations. The IEEE P1904.1 SIEPON project is creating an open international system-level specification that provides for multivendor interoperability of EPON equipment while accommodating the rich and varied nature of the existing deployments and standards. The development of a unified EPON data path architecture is one of the key achievements of the SIEPON project. This flexible architecture supports multiple service models, multiple provisioning and management concepts, and diversity of deployment environments and regulatory requirements.",

However, the current IP network does not have enough capabilities to support smart content delivery that enables a network to enhance end-to-end quality and fair usage of network resources for every user while optimizing network traffic for ISPs, and to present a collaborative way for a content provider. In order to realize smart content delivery, NGSON, which has recently finished standards on its functional architecture, includes important implications like context-based routing and content delivery. In this article, we focus on smart content delivery using context information called context-based content delivery (CBCD). We present experiences with implementing and evaluating the concept as a new feature of the NGSON standard. Experiment results show that a network provider could achieve over 30 percent backbone traffic reduction by realizing the CBCD concept.",

      "abstract": "This article, the fifth in a series on the history of packet switching, provides an account of the early days of commercial packet switching services in the United States. It is remarkable and refreshing - and possibly controversial - in stressing the business of technology more than the technology itself. The previous articles covered the early history of packet switching in the UK (by Peter Kirstein, February 2009) and in Canada (by Tony Rybczynski, December 2009), the early history of the Internet (by Len Kleinrock, August, 2010), and the development of X.25 virtual circuit networking in France (by Remi Depr\u00e9s, November 2010). Commercial packet switching networks were launched in most countries by the Postal Telephone &amp; Telegraph administrations (PTTs), but the situation in the U.S. was different. AT&amp;T was the dominant communications service provider, but initially showed little interest in packet communications. Entrepreneurial companies, particularly Telenet and Tymnet, became leaders in commercializing packet switching services. The earlier articles in this series described the technical history of packet switching and the development of the international X.25 standards. This article focuses on commercial, competitive and regulatory developments in the U.S. and is written by key figures in these developments. Larry Roberts is generally considered one of the pioneering architects of packet technology and, in particular, the ARPANET, and was co-founder and President of Telenet, the first regulated commercial packet carrier in the world. Stu Mathison was VP of Planning at Telenet from its creation until it became a part of Sprint in the 1980's. Phil Walker, an attorney, was also a co-founder and managed Telenet's regulatory and legal affairs.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the media consumption paradigm is changing from a single end user to a group shared experience. Now, social communication opportunities may be exploited (e.g., conferencing while watching television), facing lots of technological (e.g., synchronization, universal session handling, scalability) and perceptual (e.g., presence awareness, QoE) challenges. This article focuses on one of these major challenges ahead in new emerging social interactive multimedia applications, which is the synchronization of different media streams across multiple locations, known as inter-destination multimedia synchronization (IDMS). We describe the three kinds of temporal multimedia synchronization, and summarize some related work and examples of applications in which IDMS is needed. The article includes a discussion about an RTP/RTCP-based IDMS solution the authors have been working on, as well as the standardization status regarding this kind of synchronization.",

In this article, we have introduced the basic concept and development of a new wireless tongue-operated AT, called Tongue Drive System (TDS), that can wirelessly detect users' tongue movements using an array of magnetic sensors and a small magnetic tracer secured on the tongue, and translate them into a set of user-defined commands in real time, which can then be used to communicate with target devices in the users' environments. Our goal is to provide users with an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low-power, high-bandwidth, wireless, wearable, easy-to-use, and aesthetically appealing solution that is superior to other existing ATs for people with the most severe physical disabilities. The performance of the latest TDS prototype has been evaluated by both able-bodied subjects and patients with high-level spinal cord injuries. Results have demonstrated that the TDS can indeed offer its users much higher communication bandwidth compared to EEGbased brain computer interfaces.",

The first architecture uses muxponders and ROADMs for end-to-end wavelength transport with no digital sub-wavelength grooming. The other two utilize digital OTN switching, as either a standalone OTN switch or a converged integrated WDM/switch system, to efficiently groom services onto WDM wavelengths. Results show the integrated WDM/switch architecture utilizes the fewest WDM wavelengths and client service interfaces, and an integrated WDM/switch architecture using photonic integrated circuit technology provides the lowest operational costs.",

However, along with the service consolidation over IP and the rapid increase of network scale, the task of service and network management has become extremely complex and disordered. Efforts are being made in various areas, such as SOA, web services, IMS, P2P/CDN overlay, and cloud computing, to achieve a scalable, secure, converged, and selfmanaged service network framework to shorten the time to market of new services, as well as lower the management costs of network/service providers. Nevertheless, these technologies are not developed in a coordinated manner for optimal scalability, resource utilization, and QoS performance. In this article, we propose a multiplane framework (MPF) for NGSON based on the integration of service composition, management, and delivery, which is a top-down reference model to achieve pervasive services and efficient resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of optical technologies is driving the introduction of multirate optical networks exploiting advanced transmission techniques and efficient switching devices. In the short term, optical connections operating at 10 and 100 Gb/s will coexist in the same multi-rate network infrastructure. This, however, might introduce significant issues due to detrimental inter-channels effects, which need to be considered during network planning or connection provisioning. In the long term, connections at higher bit-rates (e.g., 400 Gb/s) and based on complex modulation formats (e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation - QAM) are expected, together with the adoption of innovative and flexible bandwidth-variable optical cross-connects (BV-OXCs). BV-OXCs have the potential to significantly improve the overall network spectrum efficiency. However, critical issues might arise in the dynamic control of network operations. This article discusses the enhancements required during operation and control of future optical networks with quality of transmission guaranteed. A first network evolution scenario is considered, where 100 Gb/s lightpaths are introduced in a native 10 Gb/s network. In such a scenario, inter-channel effects between 10 and 100 Gb/s lightpaths are highlighted. Relevant methods to account for these effects are discussed and evaluated. Then, a second network evolution scenario is assumed, in which traditional OXCs are replaced with BV-OXCs, and even higher bit-rates (e.g., 400 Gb/s 16-QAM) are introduced in the network. In particular, the problem of scalability when advertising and storing spectrum resource (i.e., frequency slices) availability is presented for flex-grid optical networks (i.e., optical networks exploiting BVOXCs). Consequently, a method to efficiently handle availability information is proposed and evaluated, showing the capability to overcome scalability issues without impacting the overall network resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "Intervehicle communication is currently transitioning from an academic exercise to a commercially attractive and feasible technology. However, many aspects of IVC protocols, their parameters and configurations, as well as application-specific adaptations are still to be studied. One of the key tools used is simulation. Looking back at recent years in IVC research, tremendous improvements in precision and realism of simulation models concerning all its aspects can be observed. These models offer a vast number of parameters, enabling investigation of a huge variety of different scenarios. We reviewed simulation studies published at major vehicular network conferences from 2009 to 2011 with a key focus on reproducibility and comparability of the published simulation studies. We are glad to present a clear trend toward a consolidated set of established standards, models, and tools. However, looking at individual papers, we commonly find key information (e.g., the used model) missing. This limits both the reproducibility and comparability of simulations conducted. We further present commonly used basic building blocks of simulations that can serve as a first step toward deriving an agreed-upon set on which IVC simulations can be based. We advocate providing all essential information as set out in this article to help keep future research reproducible and comparable.",

      "abstract": "Significant research efforts have recently been directed toward materializing smart grid for the purpose of transforming the aging power grid into an efficient and intelligent electric power distribution system. Conceptually, smart grid can be regarded as a fusion of different advanced technologies (i.e., electrical power engineering meets sensing, control, digital communication, and network information technologies). However, when these advanced technologies converge at smart grid, we will face many unforeseen challenges, particularly security challenges in smart grid communications. In this article, toward secure targeted broadcast in smart grid, we investigate the applicability of Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) for smart grid communication scenarios. In particular, we focus on the application of Key Policy ABE (KPABE), where a smart grid control center can use KP-ABE to broadcast a single encrypted message to a specific group of users, and each user in the targeted group can individually use the defined key policy to decrypt the message. With this kind of KP-ABE targeted broadcast, it is possible to eliminate the need for issuing multiple unicast messages. As a result, both communication and computation efficiency can be ensured.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the quality of experience notion has become a major research theme within the telecommunications community. QoE is an assessment of the human experience when interacting with technology and business entities in a particular context. A communication ecosystem encompasses various domains such as technical aspects, business models, human behavior, and context. For each aspect of a communication ecosystem, various models have been developed. However, few models have been designed to integrate all aspects of a communication ecosystem to understand human behavioral needs in a detailed and structured way. While existing models have produced the basic sketch of QoE modeling, more concepts and interdomain mapping are to be incorporated in order to have a clear picture of QoE in communication ecosystems. The aim of the current work is to build on the existing research being conducted in disparate disciplines about human behavior in order to provide a high-level model that can be adapted to many specific contexts and to encourage future research which examines these crossdomain relationships.",

      "abstract": "The use of electronic health (eHealth) technologies in healthcare improves the quality of health services furnished to patients. The application of these technologies helps physicians and other health professionals to pursue early detection of abnormal status on patients' health. Body sensor networks are a type of wireless sensor networks aimed to be deployed on persons in order to collect physiological parameters for healthcare monitoring purposes. These BSNs are composed by several small sensors placed along patient's body, and capable to send (wirelessly) the collected health parameters to remote providers. BSNs need to operate every time and everywhere to transmit these important parameters to healthcare providers or automatic system to detect any anomaly in the patient health status. To provide this continuous monitoring of patients, it is mandatory to provide mobility support for the BSN so it can always be connected to some gateway to the Internet and therefore to back-end health providers. Several mechanisms with mobility support for mobile devices have been provided. However, the mobility support of a whole BSN has not been fully addressed. This article overviews available handover mechanisms used for wireless sensors mobility and proposes a new ubiquitous mobility approach for BSNs in healthcare. A case study with this new handover mechanism developed for a hospital infirmary is presented and highlights the gain of performances of the proposed solution.",

In this article, an experimental demonstration of the newly developed advanced RoFSO system capable of transmitting the Japanese integrated services digital broadcasting- terrestrial (ISDB-T) signals over a 1 km FSO link is presented. Our innovative system combines a new generation full optical FSO system with radio over fiber technology. Important performance quality metrics like the modulation error ratio and bit error rate are measured and analyzed to characterize the deployment environment influencing the transmission of ISDB-T signals over the FSO link. The obtained results can be used for designing, predicting, and evaluating the RoFSO system capable of transmitting multiple wireless services over turbulent FSO links.",

However, available technologies present different characteristics depending on the environment or the working domain that, in a context of non-experienced users, hinders the development of interoperable services. This article compares the most recent technological proposals and analyzes their key points, and presents a compilation of the major interoperability proposals and initiatives for the considered communication domains. The work is completed with a reasoned discussion on trends on architectural approaches to cross-domain integration that can be used to overcome the issues generated by the segmented ecosystems presented above.",

      "abstract": "Deployment of low-power nodes such as picocells, femtocells, and relay nodes within macrocell coverage is seen as a cost-effective way to increase system capacity and to equip wireless WANs with the ability to keep up with the increasing demand for data capacity. These new types of deployments are commonly referred to as heterogeneous networks and are currently receiving significant attention in industry. However, simple deployment of low-power nodes can lead to underutilization of air-interface resources due to the relatively small footprint of the lowpower nodes or service outage in the case of femto cells with restricted access. Time-domain interference management techniques by the configuration of almost blank subframes, introduced in LTE Rel-10 standards, allow the removal of most of the interference from the dominant interfering nodes. This mechanism enables cell biasing or cell range extension of weak cells, thereby maximizing the incremental gain provided by the deployment of low-power nodes. The configuration of ABS changes the interference conditions seen by the user equipment and therefore requires corresponding resource-specific measurements and feedback at the UE. In this article, we provide an overview of LTE Rel-10 resource specific radio link monitoring, radio resource management, and channel state information feedback procedures. Also, we provide evaluation results to show that UE receivers, in the detection of weak cells and removal of interference in demodulation of control and data channels, play a critical role in realizing the full potential that the deployment of heterogeneous networks can offer.",

While users could manually command their operation, it will be extremely convenient to have an environment where interaction workflows could easily be defined so that services could operate autonomously following those patterns. This article presents a system to allow individuals with no specific programming skills to define and execute those interaction workflows using graphical abstractions. The system has been validated inside a smart home scenario, as a good representative of the future Internet of Services environment due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous devices and services from different domains.",

      "abstract": "Coding techniques are progressively succeeding in finding a beneficial use throughout all the components of advanced multimedia streaming networks, including peer-to-peer (P2P) content distribution strategies. In fact, although P2P algorithms are regarded as an important technology that will be part of future commercial Internet protocol television (IPTV) platforms, it has been shown that their ability to efficiently distribute multimedia streams within strict time constraints, and their robustness to high churn rates, can still improve when putting to good use source and network coding algorithms. For this reason, in the past few years a wealth of research has been undertaken aiming at jointly optimizing both coding and streaming schemes. In this article, we analyze the progress made by the latest scientific research in the field of jointly using coding and P2P streaming strategies, and we offer a set of experimental results performed on a real planet-wide P2P streaming test-bed, using Digital Fountains (DFs). Surprisingly, our testbed study reveals that utilizing DF techniques is not always beneficial to the distribution of streaming data using a P2P distribution strategy. In fact, our results show that only when the network scales beyond a certain size, it is possible to appreciate the advantages introduced by the use of DFs, showing that coding techniques should always be carefully deployed and their advantages well understood. For this reason, we believe this work can provide a useful aid in better appreciating the critical aspects of jointly utilizing multimedia streaming and DF coding techniques for IPTV.",

We extend our work in [1], in which we defined and analyzed the causes of the stagnation of broadband penetration in India, and propose a comprehensive solution. Specifically, we understand the problem from a business perspective, and then propose a novel techno-economic model that is shown to lead to enhanced broadband penetration. This model is based on a concept that we term global content balancing - showcasing the relationship between content and the proliferation of broadband. We show the working of this model and postulate reasons for its acceptability and success. A simulations study evaluates our solution and compares it to usage-based approaches, showing a return on investment improvement.",

Such small devices, often various types of sensors and actuators, are required to sustain reliable operation for years on batteries even in the presence of heavy interference. The IEEE 802.11 standard has established itself as one of the most popular wireless technologies offering connectivity. Using commercially available chips, we demonstrate the feasibility of low-power Wi-Fi technology to enable IP connectivity of battery powered devices. Three typical sensor application scenarios are investigated. We evaluate the power consumption of Wi-Fi enabled devices for each of the scenarios, investigate the impact of interference, and measure the range performance.",

      "abstract": "Significant research work has been conducted in software engineering to facilitate and speed up the process of service creation by experienced developers. Recently, however, service creation by ordinary users has attracted more and more attention as non-technical people have begun to play an active role in service life cycles, especially in a Web 2.0 context. In addition, service creation by ordinary users tackles the heterogeneity, the dynamicity, and the spontaneous nature of users needs. We show that current technologies are mainly inspired by previous approaches and architectures conceived for experienced developers, which means that they are not really adequate for service creation by ordinary users. This article proposes a novel service creation environment for ordinary users. It is made up of a new Widget abstraction layer that exposes the graphical user interface of services as reusable components, and relies on a two-step mechanism to compose these services at runtime. A proof of concept prototype has been built. The new abstraction layer offers interfaces that are much more user friendly than the current service creation tools. It also enables the different capabilities of a service to be seamlessly handled throughout its usage lifecycle.",

      "abstract": "Next-generation telematics solutions are being driven by the maturation of recently deployed intelligent transportation systems, assisted by the integration of and rapid collaboration with information communication technology markets and the automotive industry. Examples of this trend can be found in DSRC contexts in which Wi-Fi and WiMAX have become very relevant in vehicular environments. Comprehensive field trials were conducted and relevant measurements were collected in physical environments to investigate the possible environmental factors that occur in roadside-unit-to-vehicle communication scenarios. In these carefully controlled automobile experiments, the most representative parameters are measured and analyzed for DSRC in dynamic environments (e.g., packet loss, latency, and delay spread). Using a systematic testing procedure and through measurement analysis, the communication performance and the operating reliability of wireless communications can be effectively verified; insightful improvements and helpful suggestions and contributions may thus be achieved for telematics system designs. Furthermore, a practical, reasonable, and standardized testing procedure is proposed, and it can be utilized in equipment verification and product certification.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in radio technology provide great flexibility and enhanced capabilities in executing wireless services. One of these capabilities that can provide significant advantages over traditional approaches is the concept of collaborative computing in wireless networks. With collaborative radio nodes, multiple independent radio nodes operate together to form a wireless distributed computing (WDC) network with significantly increased performance, operating efficiency, and abilities over a single node. WDC exploits wireless connectivity to share processing- intensive tasks among multiple devices. The goals are to reduce per-node and network resource requirements, and enable complex applications not otherwise possible, e.g., image processing in a network of small form factor radio nodes. As discussed in this article, WDC research aims to quantify the benefits of distributed processing over local processing, extend traditional distributed computing (DC) approaches to allow operation in dynamic radio environments, and meet design and implementation challenges unique to WDC with the help of recently available enabling technologies, such as software radios and cognitive radios.",
