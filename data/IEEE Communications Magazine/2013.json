   "abstract": "The intended objective of this article is to provide designers with the basic knowledge to implement an Ethernet long-reach 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s host board. Ethernet was originated in the early 70s and has successfully displaced other popular communication standards, such as Token- Ring, becoming the default standard for local area networks in the enterprise office and datacenter equipment. Its success has roots on its basic open architecture and asynchronous protocol. During the lifetime of the Ethernet, the data rates have dramatically increased from its original 10 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s at the present time and the standard body is in the process of generating the next higher speed project most likely to be 400 Gb/s. In 2010 the IEEE802.3 body published the Ethernet 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s standard targeting the support of the next generation of communication equipment and components. The IEEE802.3ba\u2122- 2010 Ethernet standard was a quantum leap to penetrate Communication Metropolitan applications, a.k.a. Wide Area Network (WAN), which were clearly dominated by the SONET/SDH protocol. This article is a continuation to the article published in the IEEE Communication Magazine in its April 2012 edition \"40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet Short-Reach Optical and Copper Host Board Channel Design\"[1], which presented the challenges of designing 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet host board electrical and optical channels targeted for Enterprise/Datacenter applications. The article reviews the long-reach for 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet and the extendedreach Ethernet for 100 Gb/s host board channel electrical and optical specifications for Metropolitan/ Carrier applications. The long- and extendedreach links are intended for communication carrier equipment in inter- and intra-city infrastructures. The host board channel comprises the electrical (host board and connector) and the optical (module) sections. This article will analyze both sections and highlight the salient specifications that the designer of 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s Ethernet switches and ports needs to know to comply with the standard.",

Part II extends the survey of backhaul technologies to address LTE-based RANs. We present various alternatives to deal with the specific requirements imposed by Evolved Packet System architecture on the backhaul design. In particular, we address handling of the X2 interface, network security through IPSec, distribution of frequency and phase synchronization, the impact of small cell design, self-organizing networks, and endend QoS management within backhaul. We also present a brief overview of active debates with respect to some of these design options as open issues, in particular the impact of LTE-Advanced requirements on LTE backhaul design.",

   "abstract": "Providing uniformly high capacity in cellular systems is challenging due to fading, path loss, and interference. A partial solution to this problem is the deployment of distributed antenna systems, where transmission points are distributed throughout the cell using coax cable or fiber, instead of being centrally located on a single tower. This article reviews how distributed antenna systems are evolving to provide higher performance on the downlink in cellular systems. Research trends in distributed antennas for the downlink of cellular systems are described along with current progress on their integration into commercial wireless cellular standards. A key observation is that distributed antenna systems are tightly integrated into the cellular architecture, and incorporate physical layer technologies like MIMO communication and multiuser MIMO to provide higher data rates.",

   "abstract": "This paper briefly describes Internet development in the Republic of Korea (South Korea), which started research and development on computer networking in the late 1970s. Korea became one of the first countries to deploy the Internet in 1982 [1], and organized one of the first global Internet conferences in 1985 [2]. In the late 1990s, Korea put much effort into development of broadband networks, starting from a master plan in 1995. Korea became a world leader with widely available wired and wireless broadband networks. Korea also led in Internet applications including online games, search engines and social networking services. As one of the earlier Internet countries, Korea has been vulnerable to newly arising problems on the Internet such as cybersecurity, net abuse and game addiction. Korea has been trying to solve these problems in collaboration with other leading countries. Korea has also shared its Internet experience with other countries, in particular with developing countries. A book is in preparation on the early history of the Internet in Korea [3] together with another, co-authored with Internet pioneers in other countries, on the early history of the Internet in Asia.",

   "abstract": "The wireless industry has been experiencing an explosion of data traffic usage in recent years and is now facing an even bigger challenge, an astounding 1000-fold data traffic increase in a decade. The required traffic increase is in bits per second per square kilometer, which is equivalent to bits per second per Hertz per cell \u00d7 Hertz \u00d7 cell per square kilometer. The innovations through higher utilization of the spectrum (bits per second per Hertz per cell) and utilization of more bandwidth (Hertz) are quite limited: spectral efficiency of a point-to-point link is very close to the theoretical limits, and utilization of more bandwidth is a very costly solution in general. Hyper-dense deployment of heterogeneous and small cell networks (HetSNets) that increase cells per square kilometer by deploying more cells in a given area is a very promising technique as it would provide a huge capacity gain by bringing small base stations closer to mobile devices. This article presents a holistic view on hyperdense HetSNets, which include fundamental preference in future wireless systems, and technical challenges and recent technological breakthroughs made in such networks. Advancements in modeling and analysis tools for hyper-dense HetSNets are also introduced with some additional interference mitigation and higher spectrum utilization techniques. This article ends with a promising view on the hyper-dense HetSNets to meet the upcoming 1000\u00d7 data challenge.",

   "abstract": "Recent technological advances in the power generation and information technologies areas are helping to change the modern electricity supply system in order to comply with higher energy efficiency and sustainability standards. Smart grids are an emerging trend that introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve enough information about the grid operation together with other context data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which are also shown in this article.",

We also show that we are moving to a new paradigm in optical communications, and toward networks able to resolve these issues in a cost-effective and prompt manner. Optical networks are common transport networks for all service networks, and therefore we are expecting future research and development (R&amp;D) of optical communications and networks toward the new paradigm. As described in the first section, the amount of traffic traversing over network service provider networks is increasing continuously and steadily, and we expect that R&amp;D activities will continue to open up new avenues to allow us to extend the capability of optical transmission in a cost-effective manner. In addition, as men-tioned earlier, we are focusing on the optimization of network protocols and node system functions to reduce the CapEx and OpEx. Therefore, investigating the optimization and convergence of the optical and other layers including SDN, and their management technologies is important to actualize the new paradigm.",

   "abstract": "The convergence of emerging real-time multimedia services, the increasing coverage of high-speed wireless networks, and the evergrowing popularity of mobile devices are leading to an era of user-centric multimedia wireless services. In this scenario, heterogeneous wireless communications will coexist and ensure that the end user is always best connected. However, the quality of experience supported for highquality applications in multi-operator environments remains a significant challenge and is crucial for the success of wireless multimedia systems. This article proposes a quality of experience handover architecture for heterogeneous mobile wireless multimedia networks. The architecture extends the media independent handover/ IEEE 802.21 proposal with QoE-aware seamless mobility, video quality estimator, dynamic class of service mapping, and a set of content adaptation schemes. The proposed architecture always provides the best connection and considers the QoE needs of mobile clients and available wireless resources in IEEE 802.11e and IEEE 802.16e service classes. Simulation experiments were performed to show the impact and benefits of the proposed solution from the user's perception, by using both objective and subjective QoE metrics.",

   "abstract": "In spite of the increasing deployment of IPTV services, various functionalities still need to be improved. One of the main challenges is a reduction in startup delays, especially in channel switching, a problem that is quite relevant in IPTV systems due to bandwidth limitations, as well as the employment of buffers and distribution structures. The problem is essentially more serious in P2P IPTV systems, since the dynamic nature of P2P networks requires larger buffers and the exchange of more signaling messages to establish the overlay structures. Since users expect to be able to switch channels quickly, IPTV services must reduce startup delays to just a few seconds or even milliseconds. The aim of this article is to provide a survey of existing channel switching schemes for IPTV systems.",

   "abstract": "The testing process of state-of-the-art telecommunication equipment is a demanding task requiring multiple testing phases and significant amounts of resources. This article introduces a testing concept that enables the same testing environment to be used throughout the development lifecycle of telecommunication equipment. Moreover, the testing approach is designed to exploit the salient features of the upcoming IMT-Advanced systems in order to make the testing process more efficient. At the heart of the this wrap-around testing approach are a few multi-purpose network and radio channel emulators which can be configured to support all the testing phases from unit testing to system testing. By utilizing the same testing tools in all the testing phases, the amount of resources required for test environment maintenance and testing tool training are minimized. In addition, the extensive use of simulations makes the testing environment very flexible when it comes to studying the new features of the most recent telecommunication standards. In order to verify the feasibility of the devised testing approach, this article also contains a case study example, in which an implementation of the wrap-around testing environment is built from commercial testing tools. In the presented case study, the testing environment implementation is used for throughput testing of an LTE eNB in SISO and MIMO configurations. The results obtained are compared to the theoretical performance values of the technology and, together with earlier studies, demonstrate that a testing environment based on the wrap-around testing concept can be used in different testing phases during LTE eNB development.",

   "abstract": "Spectrum sharing potentially holds the promise of solving the emerging spectrum crisis. However, technology innovators face the conundrum of developing spectrum sharing technologies without the ability to experiment and test with real incumbent systems. Interference with operational incumbents can prevent critical services, and the cost of deploying and operating an incumbent system can be prohibitive. Thus, the lack of incumbent systems and frequency authorization for technology incubation and demonstration has stymied spectrum sharing research. To this end, industry, academia, and regulators all require a test facility for validating hypotheses and demonstrating functionality without affecting operational incumbent systems. This article proposes a four-phase program supported by our spectrum accountability architecture. We propose that our comprehensive experimentation and testing approach for technology incubation and demonstration will accelerate the development of spectrum sharing technologies.",

   "abstract": "Delivering multiview video content over present packet networks poses multiple challenges. First, the best effort nature of the Internet exposes media packets to variable bandwidth, loss, and delay as they traverse the network. Second, the prediction dependencies employed to maximize compression efficiency make the reconstruction process at the client extremely vulnerable to missing data. Third, the heterogeneity of client devices in terms of computing power, display capabilities, and access link capacity necessitates customizing the streaming process per user. My article reviews existing opportunities for addressing these challenges from within each of the three main stages of the content delivery pipeline (i.e., encoding, transmission, and reconstruction). Concretely, I first describe adaptive source coding techniques that construct a compressed representation of the multiview video source that exhibits resilience to network bandwidth variations and client view selection uncertainty. Then I discuss intelligent methods for error protection, caching, and packet scheduling that organize the transmission of multiview data in a bandwidth-effective way. Here, I also review prospective multipath and cloud-assisted techniques for multiview video streaming. Finally, I identify robust client-side content reconstruction schemes and adaptive media playout methods that can minimize the impact of missing data and enhance the user's interactive experience. Then I proceed to describe community-driven streaming techniques for delivering interactive multiview content over a population of social peers. The article concludes with an outline of approaches for synergistic exploitation of the techniques I will present theretofore, jointly across the different layers of the network protocol stack at which they individually operate. Here, I also highlight the main deployment challenges for some of these techniques, and how their design should be addressed accordingly, to overcome them.",

   "abstract": "This article discusses novel wireless and optical technologies to address the radical new challenges of small cell mobile backhaul (MBH). Specifically, we examine 60 GHz and 70-80 GHz millimeter-wave technologies for high-capacity last mile and pre-aggregation backhaul, and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access passive optical networks as the optical technology complement for enabling flexible cost-efficient hybrid backhaul coverage. Flexible high-capacity hybrid millimeter wave/optical MBH network operation is next verified via network simulations in the context of a demanding, urban small-cell backhaul application. Finally, a novel software defined networking tool called the backhaul resource manager is introduced for automated dynamic resource provisioning and capacity-aware path computation that improves fairness, network utilization and end-to-end user quality of experience. The introduction of the novel wireless, optical, and software-defined technologies thus has the potential to truly revolutionize the future MBH network.",

The dominant supporter of this effort is the significant improvement in spatial spectrum utilization and indoor coverage expected to be achieved through the penetration of femtocells inside the conventional macrocell areas. However, taking into account that femtocells will spatially reuse the spectrum assigned to macrocells in an unplanned deployment manner, the mitigation of the generated interferences becomes a major challenge. The problem is more severe in the case of closed subscriber group (CSG) femtocells, which serve only a limited set of subscribed users, and interfere with both data and control channels of non-subscribed users. Since deteriorated control channels can lead victim users to radio link or access failure, this article studies the problem of control channel interference in LTE-Advanced networks overlaid by CSG femtocells. Focusing on the downlink interference perceived by macrocell users, a categorization and a performance comparison of the fundamental and emerging control channel interference management schemes are provided.",

An early-warning service for emerging communication disruption due to both unintentional interference and jamming, would therefore be a significant contribution for increased safety and security in such operations. We propose a solution for such an early-warning service both on the terminal and on higher system level. The solution is based on historical recorded data of both local and global information such as signal-to-interference ratio, interference classification, and position. We show by an example that with this service implemented, the operator will have increased time to take actions before a disruption occurs on a specific terminal.",

   "abstract": "A large body of research has recently addressed the channel assignment problem in multi-radio wireless mesh networks. In order to reduce interference, many proposals require radio interfaces to (more or less frequently) switch channels to exploit the availability of multiple orthogonal channels. However, such proposals have been almost exclusively evaluated by means of simulations and the impact of switching channels on the network performance has not been experimentally evaluated so far. In this article, we aim to fill such a gap and present the results of a thorough experimental campaign we conducted on the ORBIT wireless testbed to study the effects of switching channels in a multiradio wireless mesh network. Our experiments show that in common scenarios a channel switch causes a non-negligible interruption in the connectivity among nodes, which is on the order of 10 seconds. Also, our tests reveal that a rapid recovery from link failures caused by channel switches is prevented by a rather slow update of the advertised link quality. Inspired by the analysis of the experiments we conducted, we also propose and evaluate a preliminary technique to reduce the interruption in the delivery of packets caused by a channel switch.",

   "abstract": "This article reports on the technical design and analysis of an interference management protocol that enables interference avoidance among multiple PHY layer designs in the recently completed IEEE 802.15.4g standard for smart utility networking (SUN). The IEEE 802.15.4g system employs three alternate PHY layer designs for enhanced SUN implementation and deployment targeting different market segments. First, SUN is introduced from different perspectives concerning technology, regulation, and the standardization process. Updates on the IEEE 802.15.4g standardization activities, the SUNrelated rules and regulations, and a summary of system design are presented. Next, the interference management protocol for multi-PHY-layer design in a single network is described and discussed. The impact of interference due to coexisting multiple PHY layer designs is highlighted. The operational procedure and mechanism of the management protocol, known as Multi-PHY Management (MPM), are then described. Finally, performance analysis in the presence of MPM is provided and discussed to justify its significance. It is anticipated that in the near future, this interference management approach will be put to field test and then deployed to provide solutions to mitigate interference among different PHY layer designs in SUN.",

   "abstract": "Smart cities have rapidly become a hot topic within technology communities, and promise both improved delivery of services to end users and reduced environmental impact in an era of unprecedented urbanization. Both large hightech companies and grassroots citizen-led initiatives have begun exploring the potential of these technologies. Significant barriers remain to the successful rollout and deployment of business models outlined for smart city applications and services, however. Most of these barriers pertain to an ongoing battle between two main schools of thought for system architecture, ICT and telecommunications, proposed for data management and service creation. Both of these system architectures represent a certain type of value chain and the legacy perspective of the respective players that wish to enter the smart city arena. Smart cities services, however, utilize components of both the ICT industry and mobile telecommunications industries, and do not benefit from the current binary perspective of system architecture. The business models suggested for the development of smart cities require a longterm strategic view of system architecture evolution. This article discusses the architectural evolution required to ensure that the rollout and deployment of smart city technologies is smooth through acknowledging and integrating the strengths of both the system architectures proposed.",

In parallel, energy-efficient and high-security networking is of increasing importance. Network operators, and service and product providers require a new network solution to efficiently tackle the increasing demands of this changing network landscape. Software-defined networking has emerged as an efficient network technology capable of supporting the dynamic nature of future network functions and intelligent applications while lowering operating costs through simplified hardware, software, and management. In this article, the question of how to achieve a successful carrier grade network with software-defined networking is raised. Specific focus is placed on the challenges of network performance, scalability, security, and interoperability with the proposal of potential solution directions.",

   "abstract": "Optimizing the cellular network's cell locations is one of the most fundamental problems of network design. The general objective is to provide the desired QoS with the minimum system cost. In order to meet a growing appetite for mobile data services, heterogeneous networks have been proposed as a cost- and energy-efficient method of improving local spectral efficiency. While unarticulated cell deployments can lead to localized improvements, there is a significant risk posed to network-wide performance due to the additional interference. The first part of the article focuses on state-of-the-art modelling and radio planning methods based on stochastic geometry and Monte Carlo simulations, and the emerging automatic deployment prediction technique for low-power nodes, or LPNs, in heterogeneous networks. The technique advises an LPN where it should be deployed, given certain knowledge of the network. The second part of the article focuses on algorithms that utilize interference and physical environment knowledge to assist LPN deployment. The proposed techniques can not only improve network performance, but also reduce radio planning complexity, capital expenditure, and energy consumption of the cellular network. The theoretical work is supported by numerical results from system-level simulations that employ real cellular network data and physical environments.",

   "abstract": "In modern smart grid networks, the traditional power grid is empowered by technological advances in sensing, measurement, and control devices with two-way communications between the suppliers and consumers. The smart grid integration helps the power grid networks to be smarter, but it also increases the risk of attacks because of the existing obsolete cyber-infrastructure. In this article, we focus on bad data injection attacks for smart grid. The basic problem formulation is presented, and the special type of stealth attack is discussed. Then we investigate the strategies of defenders and attackers, respectively. Specifically, from the defender's perspective, an adaptive cumulative sum test is able to determine the possible existence of adversaries at the control center as quickly as possible. From the attacker's point of view, independent component analysis is employed for the attackers to make inferences through phasor observations without prior knowledge of the power grid topology. The inferred structural information can then be used to launch stealth attacks.",

   "abstract": "We have a clear idea today about the necessity and usefulness of making cities smarter, the potential market size, and trials and tests. However, it seems that business around Smart Cities is having difficulties taking off and is thus running short of projected potentials. This article looks into why this is the case and proposes a procedure to make smart cities happen based on big data exploitation through the API stores concept. To this end, we first review involved stakeholders and the ecosystem at large. We then propose a viable approach to scale business within that ecosystem. We also describe the available ICT technologies and finally exemplify all findings by means of a sustainable smart city application. Over the course of the article, we draw two major observations, which are seen to facilitate sustainable smart city development. First, independent smart city departments (or the equivalent) need to emerge, much like today's well accepted IT departments, which clearly decouple the political element of the improved city servicing from the underlying technologies. Second, a coherent three-phase smart city rollout is vital, where in phase 1 utility and revenues are generated; in phase 2 only-utility service is also supported; and in phase 3, in addition, a fun/leisure dimension is permitted.",

   "abstract": "\"Always best connectivity,\" which constitutes a key challenge in the context of 4G systems, solicits service access and provisioning through the most appropriate access network any time, any place. In this relatively well investigated area, the problem of dynamically selecting the most suitable network for a specific service, referred to as access network selection (ANS), has recently received considerable attention. However, the several ANS proposals in the literature, which have explored relevant ANS criteria, methodologies, and techniques, point out that some related technical issues are still open challenges to be resolved. The aim of this article is to identify and discuss critical aspects and research challenges involved in the design of ANS decision schemes. At the same time, current research efforts are revisited, and potential enabling technologies/solutions are highlighted, in particular the ones associated with cognition and advanced learning capabilities.",

Several factors, including cost, complexity, existing systems, and lack of cooperation between government and private sectors, have impeded the deployment of RSUs. In this article, we propose to solve this formidable problem by using a biologically inspired self-organizing network approach whereby certain vehicles serve as RSUs. The proposed solution is based on designing local rules and the corresponding algorithms that implement them. Results show that the proposed approach can increase the message reachability and connectivity substantially.",

   "abstract": "Wireless solutions are rapidly growing in machine-to-machine communications in industrial environments. These environments provide challenging conditions in terms of radio wave propagation as well as electromagnetic interference. In this article, results from the characterization of radio channel properties are summarized in order to provide some guidelines for the choice of wireless solutions in industrial environments. In conclusion, it is essential to know the sensitivity of industrial processes to time delay in data transfer. Furthermore, it is important to be aware of the radio interference environment and the manner in which different wireless technologies react upon interference. These steps will minimize the risk of unforeseen expensive disturbances in industrial processes.",

Tenants can benefit from on-demand provisioning of compute, storage, and networking resources according to a pay-per-use business model. Tenants have only limited visibility and control over network resources. The owners of cloud computing facilities are also facing challenges in various aspects of providing and efficiently managing IaaS facilities. In this work we present the networking issues in IaaS and federation challenges that are currently addressed with existing technologies. We also present innovative software-defined networking proposals, which are applied to some of the challenges and could be used in future deployments as efficient solutions.",

   "abstract": "This article addresses the potential impact of emerging technologies and solutions, such as software defined networking and network function virtualization, on carriers' network evolution. It is argued that standard hardware advances and these emerging paradigms can bring the most impactful disruption at the network's edge, enabling the deployment of clouds of nodes using standard hardware: it will be possible to virtualize network and service functions, which are provided today by expensive middleboxes, and move them to the edge, as close as possible to users. Specifically, this article identifies some of key technical challenges behind this vision, such as dynamic allocation, migration, and orchestration of ensembles of virtual machines across wide areas of interconnected edge networks. This evolution of the network will profoundly affect the value chain: it will create new roles and business opportunities, reshaping the entire ICT world.",

Updates on recent movements of regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FCC, U.K. OFCOM, European CEPT, Japanese MIC, and Singapore IDA in TV white space communications are first presented. The response of the industrial community toward these new regulations is then discussed, focusing on the activities in the IEEE 802 standards association. The latest developments of IEEE 802.11, 802.22, 802.15, 802.19, and DySPAN SC are described. Considerations on system design including PHY/MAC layer design in these standards are then listed and discussed. Lastly, potential usage models of cognitive communications in TV white spaces are presented, with emphasis on required parameters as guiding references to corresponding system design.",

   "abstract": "Adopting small cells, including femtocells, is a promising evolution of future wireless cellular systems to meet the explosive demand for high data rates. As the number of distributively deployed femtocell access points increases rapidly, interference coordination becomes the primary challenge in such heterogeneous networks. In this article, we apply several cognitive radio inspired approaches to enhance the interference coordination for femtocell networks. First, we apply spectrum sensing and statistical analysis to estimate the cross-tier interference between macrocells and femtocells. Based on this, interference coordination is investigated considering two kinds of spectrum sharing approaches. Finally, we introduce a cognitive relay scheme to improve interference coordination performance further.",

   "abstract": "Troubleshooting network outages is a complex and time-consuming process. Network administrators are typically overwhelmed with large volumes of monitoring data, like SMTP and NetFlow measurements, from which it is very hard to separate between actionable and non-actionable events. In addition, they can only debug network problems using very basic tools, like ping and traceroute. In this context, intelligent correlation of measurements from different Internet locations is essential for analyzing the root cause of outages. However, correlating measurements across domains raises privacy concerns and hence is largely avoided. A possible solution to the privacy barrier is secure multi-party computation (MPC), that is, a set of cryptographic methods that enable a number of parties to aggregate private data without revealing sensitive information. In this article, we propose a distributed mechanism based on MPC for privacy-preserving correlation of NetFlow measurements from multiple ISPs, which helps in the diagnosis of network outages. We first outline an MPC protocol that can be used to analyze the scope (local, global, or semi-global) and severity of network outages across multiple ISPs. Then we use NetFlow data from a medium-sized ISP to evaluate the performance of our protocol. Our findings indicate that correlating data from several dozens of ISPs is feasible in near real time, with a delay of just a few seconds. This demonstrates the scalability and potential for real-world deployment of MPC-based schemes. Finally, as a case study we demonstrate how our scheme helped analyze, from multiple domains, the impact that Hurricane Sandy had on Internet connectivity in terms of scope and severity.",

   "abstract": "The operation and control of the next generation electrical grids will depend on a complex network of computers, software, and communication technologies. Being compromised by a malicious adversary would cause significant damage, including extended power outages and destruction of electrical equipment. Moreover, the implementation of the smart grid will include the deployment of many new enabling technologies such as advanced sensors and metering, and the integration of distributed generation resources. Such technologies and various others will require the addition and utilization of multiple communication mechanisms and infrastructures that may suffer from serious cyber vulnerabilities. These need to be addressed in order to increase the security and thus the greatest adoption and success of the smart grid. In this article, we focus on the communication security aspect, which deals with the distribution component of the smart grid. Consequently, we target the network security of the advanced metering infrastructure coupled with the data communication toward the transmission infrastructure. We discuss the security and feasibility aspects of possible communication mechanisms that could be adopted on that subpart of the grid. By accomplishing this, the correlated vulnerabilities in these systems could be remediated, and associated risks may be mitigated for the purpose of enhancing the cyber security of the future electric grid.",

   "abstract": "Compressive sensing offers an alternative to Nyquist sampling in applications where taking a complete set of measurements is impractical due to either length of time required or the volume of data produced. Here we focus on applying compressive sensing theory to RF signal environments (which will be referred to as the \"signal\"). For multi-gigahertz bandwidth signals, using Nyquist sampling requires billions of samples per second resulting in data rates of tens of billions of bits per second. This is the cost of being able to capture any arbitrary signal. Compressive sensing exploits the fact that man-made signals are structured and non-arbitrary to greatly reduce the number of samples required for signal capture. The compressibility of a signal is measured by its sparsity, which can be thought of as the number of parameters needed to describe the signal. Compressive sensing can reduce sample rate by more than an order of magnitude.",

   "abstract": "The IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) framework is a prime example of a softwaredefined network virtualisation artifact, originally envisaged about a decade ago for constraintbased routing in the conventional best-effort Internet. Over the years, however, it evolved into the ultimate tool for multi-technology, multidomain, multi-layer, and multi-vendor networking. Carriers have already started to implement PCE-based solutions in their combined Internet IP/MPLS and Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs). However, significant development and testing is still needed to elevate the PCE concepts from theory to practice. This paper addresses standards, interoperability and deployment of coordinated computation and setup of multi-layer paths from a practical perspective and presents its first implementation in a multi-vendor, interoperable PCE testbed. In our testbed, we try to push the limits of multivendor interoperability, which current research mostly neglects, and thereby identify missing links in the current research and standards necessary to implement and deploy inter-operable multi-layer systems. We point to the key areas that the research and industrial communities will need to address in making the proposed solutions practical, which in turn will drive the upcoming efforts in software-defined networking with inter-operable PCE-based architectures.",

A solution based on a 100 Gb/s single wavelength channel is capable of significant cost reductions should the required components be available. Within the HECTO project, we developed components suitable for single-wavelength 100 Gb/s transmission. In this article, the project is described - its organization, objectives, possible impacts, and results - including the successful demonstration in a final field trial. A complete ETDM system utilizing the monolithically integrated transmitter and receiver modules developed in the project was built to transmit 112 Gb/s over 42 km standard single-mode fiber. Finally, we attempt an outlook on the prospective development of Ethernet standardization beyond 100GbE.",

   "abstract": "With the development of large-scale multilayer and multidomain optical networks, the path computation process becomes increasingly complicated in consideration of various policies and constraints. In particular, to meet the rigid requirements of multiple layers and multiple domains, dynamic routing has become one of the key issues in GMPLS/ASON networks. In this article, a novel dual routing engine architecture in multilayer and multidomain scalable and constraint-aware policy-enabled optical networks, DREAM, is proposed. This new architecture exploits the advantages of both the GMPLS control plane and path computation element PCE. The cooperation of a group engine and a unit engine effectively optimizes the path computation process, especially under the multiple constraints. In this article, the functional compositions of dual routing engines, core elements of DREAM, are described in detail. Six cooperation modes between group and unit engines are investigated. Two different routing schemes (DRE-FPC and HDRE-BRPC) are proposed and evaluated on a DREAM-based testbed, which is able to support over 1000 nodes divided into 20 or more domains. Numerical results are given and analyzed based on the testbed. Some future discussion and exploration issues are presented in the conclusion.",

The goal of developing and standardizing RTCWeb for real-time communication is to enhance the communication experience over the Internet. The RTCWeb protocol stack provides a service for several use cases, which includes media as well as non-media data transfer. Therefore, it adapts some established protocols like SCTP for a new common goal. Since real-time communication comes with the inherent need for low end-to-end delay, this article will discuss possible enhancements to SCTP that will improve the RTCWeb service in that regard.",

   "abstract": "As the number of wireless users and per-user bandwidth demands continue to increase, both the vendor and carrier communities agree that wireless networks must evolve toward more dense deployments. So-called heterogeneous networks are a commonly proposed evolution, whereby existing macrocellular networks are supplemented with an underlay of small cells. The placement of new small-cell sites is typically determined based on various location-dependent factors such as radio propagation calculations, user densities, and measurements of congestion and demand. The backhaul network, which can account for a significant portion of the total cost of the deployment, is then designed in reaction to the placement of small cells. In contrast, we describe a design method that first considers the locations of existing fibered and powered facilities that might be leveraged to provide inexpensive backhaul. Naturally, such a method is only feasible if the carrier has a legacy local fiber network. This article describes an efficient fiber backhaul strategy for a small-cell network, which leverages facilities associated with an existing FTTN residential access network. Once potential small-cell sites are determined from among all FTTN remote terminals, optimization techniques are used to choose the most efficient subset of sites for maximum coverage, and to design the fiber backhaul architecture.",

   "abstract": "This article provides an overview of technical design considerations for IEEE 802.15.4m LRWPAN operating in TVWS. We summarize and discuss TVWS regulatory requirements and LRWPAN applications, the two major driving forces motivating the formation of the new IEEE 802.15.4m standard. These forces define the criteria necessary for consideration during IEEE 802.15.4m system design to meet regulatory requirements and optimize performance. First, system design is presented from the perspective of LR-WPAN channelization with reference to the TV channel plan. Next, design considerations for network architecture and topology are discussed by relating the architecture requirement in TVWS regulations to that in the legacy IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Third, the PHY and MAC layer designs, which are crucial for meeting the criterion of optimizing LR-WPAN performance to support potential applications, are studied. In the PHY layer, the existing design in IEEE 802.15.4 is listed and discussed with regard to its applicability and reusability in TVWS. In the MAC layer, two functional entities, the TVWS operation-enabling feature and the dynamic frequency-band switching mechanism, are discussed with respect to their necessity and practicality for performance enhancement.",

   "abstract": "Mobile network operators are experiencing a tremendous increase in data traffic due to the growing popularity of bandwidth-intensive video services. This challenge can be faced either by boosting the capacity of the network infrastructure, or by means of offloading traffic from the backhaul and core network and serving contents from distributed cache servers close to the users. Network operators can extend the coverage of traditional CDNs by making usage of caching locations much closer to the users than traditional CDNs. Additionally, network operators can optimize the caching and delivery of contents by exploiting the complete knowledge of their network for designing a cost-effective infrastructure able to achieve both improved user satisfaction and cost savings. This article provides thoroughly justified design principles for a highly distributed operator-owned CDN while focusing on four key aspects: the optimal location of cache servers, mechanisms for request routing, content replica placement, and content outsourcing and retrieval.",

These capabilities rely on the composition of link and multihop mechanisms into a coherent system, with particular attention to managing errors in and loss of delicate quantum states. This article explores quantum networking in terms of fundamental network architecture principles, and explains where and how it diverges from its classical counterparts. It discusses engineering principles that ensure robust and interoperable communication by introducing new protocol layers to support quantum sessions, and considers how these layers interact with quantum link mechanisms to support user-level quantum-enabled applications.",

   "abstract": "The advancement of the process technology, especially CMOS technology, has played a major role in the miniaturization of the mobile device as well as extending its battery life. As digital logic continues to shrink in size and increase in density, implementing RF/analog functions digitally becomes increasingly more attractive. RF/analog digitization not only allows the design blocks to benefit from process scaling, but also enables a more complete system-on-chip integration. In this article, several digitally enhanced CMOS transmitter implementations are discussed, and their trade-offs are analyzed. A digital quadrature transmitter that is process-scaling-friendly and multimode-capable is presented at the end. The chip is implemented in 40 nm CMOS process and can easily be integrated with digital baseband processors.",

   "abstract": "We investigate the challenges in designing the network architecture for running EPON (Ethernet Passive Optical Network) Protocol over Coax, or EPoC in short. EPoC is the transparent extension of EPON over a cable operator's Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) network, and uses a hybrid of optical and coaxial technologies to carry traffic to and from end-users and the Internet backbone. For managing and controlling such a hybrid network, a network operator will prefer to have a unified scheduling, management, and quality-of-service (QoS) environment that includes both the optical and coax portions of the network. This can be achieved by extending the EPON Medium Access Control (MAC) to run over the coax physical layer, to have a centralized end-to-end network control from the cable head-end to the end-users' premises. The use of the coax portion of the network is transparent to EPON protocol operation in the headend, as the same MAC runs over the entire network. In this article, we describe the architecture of EPoC, and outline how the EPON MAC Control, i.e., the EPON Multi-Point Control Protocol (MPCP) can be extended for designing an end-to-end Multi-Point MAC Control for EPoC. We explain the design of several MAC functions and their operation, including framing for coax, Ethernet frame fragmentation, generation of upstream and downstream Media Allocation Plans, and automatic discovery and registration of user equipment. With strong backing from both service operators and equipment vendors, EPoC is set to become a rapidly-evolving standard within the next few years, and the creation of the IEEE 802.3bn Task Force for EPoC is a major step in that direction.",

The combination of layered media such as the scalable and 3D extension of the H.264/AVC or emerging H.265/HEVC format with the physical layer pipes feature of DVB-T2 enables flexible broadcast of services with differentiated protection of the quality layers. This opens up new ways of service provisioning such as graceful degradation for mobile or fixed reception.

   "abstract": "These days there is a clear trend toward extending the reach of passive optical networks to cover large geographical areas, which enables reduction of the number of central offices and hence has the potential of cost saving in network operation. On the other hand, this reach extension necessitates the design of efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes in order to tackle performance degradation caused by the increased propagation delay in long reach PONs. Among many existing approaches, the multi-thread-based DBA scheme where several bandwidth allocation processes are performed in parallel is considered one of the most effective options to improve network performance in LRPONs. We have found that without proper intercommunication between the overlapped threads, multi-thread DBA may lose efficiency and even perform worse than the conventional single-thread algorithm. With this in mind, this article reviews different inter-thread scheduling schemes for LR-PONs, and proposes a novel approach of integrating the key ideas of the existing ones. Extensive simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme can significantly improve DBA performance for LR-PONs under a variety of scenarios with consideration of different values of network load and reach.",

   "abstract": "The rise of new real-time interactive services, in which consumers demand high subjective quality, makes it necessary to define new network mechanisms that can dynamically adapt to traffic variations. Cooperation between the different actors is required in order to adapt the traditional network infrastructure to these new traffic patterns while guaranteeing delay requirements. Thus, standardization is needed in order to make cooperation possible. A method for tunneling compressed multiplexed traffic flows (TCMTF) is proposed as an update to TCRTP, the current practice defined by the IETF for optimizing RTP flows. Some scenarios have been identified in which traffic optimization can be deployed, while granting resource usage fairness and good user experience. This proposal could be used in different application environments, such as operators' networks, Internet service providers, long distance transports, and game providers.",

   "abstract": "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is considered a prominent model for IP based service delivery. As grid and cloud computing have become a stringent demand for today's Internet services, IaaS is required for providing services, particularly \"private cloud,\" regardless of physical infrastructure locations. However, enabling IaaS on traditional Internet Service Provider (ISP) network infrastructures is challenging because IaaS requires a high abstraction level of network architectures, protocols, and devices. Network control plane architecture plays therefore an essential role in this transition, particularly with respect to new requirements of scalability, reliability, and flexibility. In this article we review the evolutionary trend of network element control planes from monolithic to distributed architectures according to network growth, and then present a new virtualization oriented architecture that allows infrastructure providers and service providers to achieve service delivery independently and transparently to end users based on virtualized network control planes. As a result, current ISP infrastructures will be able to support new services, such as heavy resource consuming data center applications. We also show how to use network virtualization for providing cloud computing and data center services in a flexible manner on the nationwide CANARIE network infrastructure.",

   "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to substantially support sustainable development of future smart cities. This article identifies the main issues that may prevent IoT from playing this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among connected objects and the unreliable nature of associated services. To solve these issues, a cognitive management framework for IoT is proposed, in which dynamically changing real-world objects are represented in a virtualized environment, and where cognition and proximity are used to select the most relevant objects for the purpose of an application in an intelligent and autonomic way. Part of the framework is instantiated in terms of building blocks and demonstrated through a smart city scenario that horizontally spans several application domains. This preliminary proof of concept reveals the high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can achieve in the context of smart cities.",

   "abstract": "The increasing adoption of COTS hardware and software technologies in tactical scenarios raises the issue of supporting the deployment of legacy and COTS applications in extremely dynamic and challenging environments such as tactical edge networks (TENs). COTS applications adopt standards devised for wired Internet environments or corporate networks, such as service oriented architectures, and TCP and UDP, thus exhibiting severe reliability and performance problems on TENs. To support the reuse and deployment of COTS applications in TENs, there is the need to develop solutions that mediate the application requirements with the communication semantics of TENs. This article presents an overview of the challenges in deploying COTS applications in TENs and presents NetProxy, a state-of-the-art solution explicitly designed to address them.",

   "abstract": "The goal of the European ICT Project EARTH is to enhance energy efficiency of current LTE cellular networks by 50 percent, enabling operators to provide more extensive coverage, namely to less densely populated areas, while ensuring high levels of efficiency, hence, reducing the carbon footprint. In order to achieve this objective, different strategies, at different levels, are being addressed. Energy efficient transmission techniques for LTE, proposed within the framework of EARTH, are addressed and discussed, with an emphasis on beamforming and MIMO. It is concluded that the strategic objective of EARTH is achievable. Combined MIMO mode selection, resource allocation, scheduling and precoding strategies will allow an energy consumption reduction of more than 50 percent in macro-cells. A reduction in MIMO power consumption of 91.7 percent (factor of 12) can be achieved in pico-cells.",

The integration of renewable, low-polluting, distributed energy resources in the power grid is an important step toward sustainable development. In this article, we propose two architectures, clustered and distributed, for labeling the energy source provided to the smart grid. A label contains the energy amount provided to the smart grid and its sustainability index. Labels from multiple energy sources can be compounded and displayed to end users accordingly with the architecture used to inform how sustainable the production process of the energy being rendered to the consumers in a given area is. The comprehension of how sustainable the energy production is can entail a change of mind in consumers and energy distributors. We also evaluate both architectures according to the the sustainability index accuracy and generated network traffic.",

   "abstract": "Mobile Internet applications run on devices such as smartphones and tablets, and have dramatically changed the landscape of applicationgenerated network traffic. The potent combination of millions of such applications and the instant accessibility of high-speed Internet on mobile devices through 3G and now LTE technology has also changed how users themselves interact with the Internet. Specifically, the radio states in LTE such as RRC_Connected and RRC_Idle were designed with more traditional applications such as web browsing and FTP in mind. These traditional applications typically generated traffic only during Active (Connected) state, and once the user session ended, usually the traffic ended too, thus allowing the radio to move to Inactive (Idle) state. However, newer applications such as Facebook and Twitter generate a constant stream of autonomous and/or user generated traffic at all times, thus erasing the previously clear demarcation between Active and Inactive states. This means a given mobile device (or user equipment, in LTE parlance) often ends up moving between Connected and Idle states frequently to send mostly short bursts of data, draining device battery and causing excessive signaling overhead in LTE networks. This problem has grown and attracted the research community's attention to address the negative effects of frequent back and forth transitions between LTE radio states. In this article, we first explore the traffic characteristics of these emerging mobile Internet applications and how they differ from more traditional applications. We investigate their impact on LTE device power and air interface signaling. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art solutions proposed in literature to address the problems, and analyze their merits and demerits. Lastly, we discuss the solutions adopted by 3GPP including the latest developments in Release 11 to handle these issues, and present potential future research directions in this field.",

The new generation EM systems leverage advanced analytics and communication technologies to offer consumers actionable information and control features, while ensuring ease of use, availability, security, and privacy. In this article, we present a survey of the state of the art in EM systems, applications, and frameworks. We define a set of requirements for EM systems and evaluate several EM systems in this context. We also discuss emerging trends in this area.",

   "abstract": "Heterogeneous network, or HetNet, deployments are one of the key enablers in providing ubiquitous coverage and capacity enhancements for LTE-Advanced networks. They play an important role in achieving high data rate and quality of service requirements defined for next generation wireless networks. In this article we evaluate various cell discovery techniques tailored for energy-efficient detection of small cells deployed in a carrier other than the serving macrocell. The presented schemes are evaluated using extensive system simulations conducted in a 3GPP LTE-Advanced HetNet scenario. Shortcomings of the currently standardized mechanism are analyzed, and advantages of the evaluated schemes are presented. Both the offloading opportunity utilization and savings in UE battery power consumption are analyzed. The results show that using the considered flexible, adaptive, and intelligent schemes for small cell discovery, significant UE power savings can be achieved with small loss in offloading - giving benefits both on system level as well as in user experience.",

For reducing the total power consumption in the mid-term upgrade to 10-gigabit access, it is necessary to optimize the network configuration as well as the usage of various technologies while avoiding any service degradation in the next-generation broadband services. In the long-term evolution, wavelength routing will play a key role by drastically decreasing the total power consumption of the access network.",

   "abstract": "The Internet explosion makes energy consumption of the ICT sector a global concern. Nowadays, the power consumption of access networks increases rapidly due to the rollout of broadband services. Cable access networks provide Internet access over the existing cable television systems. Among all wired access networks, they have the second biggest user base, which is still growing fast due to the release of the new industry standard, DOCSIS 3.0. Therefore, we expect that cable access networks will play an important role in the ICT sector of future smart cities. In order to boost up bidirectional throughput, DOCSIS 3.0 introduces the channel bonding technology, which could lead to increased power consumption if not properly managed. In this article, we present a few energy-saving algorithms that could be used by the cable operators to improve the energy efficiency of cable access networks using channel bonding. The discussions cover both the network-wide energy-saving algorithm and the customer-side energy-saving algorithm, and provide investigations on the trade-offs between energy-saving and other network performance metrics, including packet delay and protocol overhead. Our numerical results suggest that effective energy saving can be achieved in wideband cable access networks with the proposed algorithms, and the packet delay and protocol overhead can be reduced if we choose the key parameters properly.",

   "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel abstraction layer for application service implementation compliant with the Java Call Control (JCC) specifications. It simplifies creation of multimedia services using SIP and the Media Gateway Control Protocol. In order to show its effectiveness, we have implemented a JCC resource adaptor for a JAIN service logic execution environment (JSLEE), using the Mobicents application server, which is the only existing open source JSLEE implementation. Experimental results obtained by implementing a complex VoIP service show both a significant simplification of service implementation and improved performance over legacy solutions.",

   "abstract": "VLC technology is receiving increasing attention in research and product development these days because high lumen/watt LEDs are becoming the dominant sources for artificial lighting. Successful VLC data transmission from luminaires requires that the data first be moved to the luminaires over a backbone network. This article addresses the lighting control network as a backbone for VLC services and describes a standards-drafting project, designated BSR E1.45, for entertainment lighting control to support the transmission of data for VLC from luminaires. E1.45 specifies a data frame format that can coexist with ANSI E1.11 messages on lighting control network, and thus deliver VLC data to luminaires for transmission from those luminaires.",

EstiNet uses an unique kernel reentering simulation methodology to enable unmodified real applications to run on nodes in its simulated network. As a result, without any modification, real NOX/POX or Floodlight OpenFlow controllers can readily run on a host in an EstiNet simulated network to control thousands of simulated OpenFlow switches. EstiNet has the characteristics of a simulator and an emulator at the same time. It combines the advantages of the simulation and emulation approaches without their respective shortcomings. EstiNet uses real OpenFlow controller programs, real network application programs, and the real TCP/IP protocol stack in the Linux kernel to generate correct, accurate, and repeatable SDN application performance results. In this article, we compare EstiNet with ns-3 and Mininet regarding their capabilities, performance, and scalability.",

The IEEE 802.3 Working Group has been working for the last 30+ years, pushing the boundaries on the speed and capacity of wireline Ethernet links, migrating from shared medium CSMA/CD systems to switched point-to-point Ethernet and then introducing multilane technology and point-to-point emulation over shared media of passive optical networks. In this article, we look at the latest projects adding new features and capabilities to the family of wired Ethernet standards, enabling the exponential growth of the Ethernet ecosystem, driven by technical maturity, cost effectiveness, and broad market support.",

   "abstract": "Network operators are currently in the midst of a situation in which there is doubling of bandwidth requirement every two years, although the growth in revenue is nearly flat. In this situation providers must plan their networks to optimize for future growth and take into consideration flat-to-declining operating margins. The OPEX benefits of keeping the data in the lower layers of the network stack can be leveraged to plan future networks. We focus on the impact of evolving standards in the lower layers of the telecommunications stack through the contributions of the IEEE, ITU, and IETF. Specifically, we focus on the WDM, carrier Ethernet, OTN, MPLS, and MPLS-TP set of transport standards. These standards have evolved and are being adapted to meet the requirements of next generation networks and currently being considered in the standard bodies. We show through a simulation study that by adopting the packet-optical integrated standard families, providers would benefit because of CAPEX reduction and thereby enhance margins - benefiting the e-community through better services.",

   "abstract": "Small cell techniques are recognized as the best way to deliver high capacity for broadband cellular communications. Femtocell and distributed antenna systems (DASs) are important components in the overall small cell story, but are not the complete solution. They have major disadvantages of very limited cooperation capability and expensive deployment cost, respectively. In this article, we propose a novel mobile-over-FTTx (MoF) network architecture, where an FTTx network is enhanced as an integrated rather than a simple backhauling component of a new mobile network delivering low-cost and powerful small cell solutions. In part, the MoF architecture combines the advantages of femtocells and DASs, while overcoming their disadvantages. Implementation challenges and potential solutions are discussed. Simulation results are presented and demonstrate the strong potential of the MoF in boosting the capacity of mobile networks.",

   "abstract": "Future wireless networks are expected to provide high bandwidth multimedia services in extended areas with homogeneous quality of service levels. Conventional cellular architectures might not be able to satisfy these requirements due to the effect of surrounding obstacles and the signal attenuation with distance, in particular under non-line-of-sight propagation conditions. Recent studies have investigated the potential of multihop cellular networks (MCNs) to overcome the traditional cellular architecture limitations through the integration of cellular and ad hoc networking technologies. However, these studies are generally analytical or simulation-based. On the other hand, this article reports the first experimental field tests, which validate and quantify the benefits MCNs using mobile relays can provide over traditional cellular systems.",

   "abstract": "The growing popularity of mobile data services necessitates a rapid rise in network capacity not only on the air interface to the end user, but also in the backhaul network. The latter is quite important for the mobile operator business model, affecting capital investment, operational expenses, service deployment, and customer experience. Fiber infrastructure is inevitably the only long-term solution, and the deployment of passive optical networks presents an opportunity for a cost-effective, scalable, and future-proof solution. In this article we investigate the use of PONs for mobile backhaul and propose a resource allocation framework building on the efficiency of PONs to share resources, dynamically allocate bandwidth in real time, and enhance efficiency by improved statistical multiplexing. The main objective of this work is to exploit existing standardized technologies, and provide design and deployment guidelines regarding PON MAC operation, enabling a gradual and future-safe infrastructure upgrade of mobile backhaul systems.",

   "abstract": "Software defined networks are based on the principle of a centralized control plane separated from the network forwarding or switching plane that it controls. The switching plane can be heterogeneous, composed of network elements from multiple vendors, and it can provide distinct services with different characteristics, configurations, and control at the packet and/or optical layers. Abstracting the control plane from the network elements allows network-platform- specific characteristics and differences that do not affect services to be hidden. In addition, software defined networking (SDN) is based on the principle that applications can request needed resources from the network via interfaces to the control plane. Through these interfaces, applications can dynamically request network resources or network information that may span disparate technologies. For instance, the application layer can dynamically request and obtain network resources at the packet flow, circuit, or even optical level based on application layer requirements. Current SDN implementations focus on Ethernet switching primarily for data center resource optimization. This article reviews the benefits and challenges of extending SDN concepts to various transport network architectures that include optical wavelength and fiber switches, circuit switches, and sub-wavelength optical burst switches. Control plane implementations for optical networks are more complex since they must account for physical constraints including optical signal reachability, bandwidth availability and granularity, light path routing, and light path reconfiguration speed. The longterm goal is to apply SDN concepts across multi-layer multivendor networks in order to support a unified control structure.",

It is based on distributed caching of the content in femtobasestations with small or non-existing backhaul capacity but with considerable storage space, called helper nodes. We also consider using the wireless terminals themselves as caching helpers, which can distribute video through device-to-device communications. This approach allows an improvement in the video throughput without deployment of any additional infrastructure. The new architecture can improve video throughput by one to two orders-of-magnitude.",

A cost-efficient fully reliable and accurate monitoring solution supporting fault detection, identification, and localization in different fiber access topologies will be a key part of such solutions. In this article, we discuss practical requirements for a successful PON monitoring technique followed by an overview of published proposals. We also present a method to monitor power-splitter- and wavelength-splitter-based PON, through combined techniques of OTDR and OTM. The method is non-invasive to data traffic flow and requires no additional functionality (hardware or software) at the ONT side. The description of the overall architecture and components is followed by measurement results.",

   "abstract": "This article investigates how and to what extent the power of collective although imprecise intelligence can be employed in smart cities. The main visionary goal is to automate the organization of spontaneous and impromptu collaborations of large groups of people participating in collective actions (i.e., participAct), such as in the notable case of urban crowdsensing. In a crowdsensing environment, people or their mobile devices act as both sensors that collect urban data and actuators that take actions in the city, possibly upon request. Managing the crowdsensing process is a challenging task spanning several socio-technical issues: from the characterization of the regions under control to the quantification of the sensing density needed to obtain a certain accuracy; from the evaluation of a good balance between sensing accuracy and resource usage (number of people involved, network bandwidth, battery usage, etc.) to the selection of good incentives for people to participAct (monetary, social, etc.). To tackle these problems, this article proposes a crowdsensing platform with three main original technical aspects: an innovative geo-social model to profile users along different variables, such as time, location, social interaction, service usage, and human activities; a matching algorithm to autonomously choose people to involve in participActions and to quantify the performance of their sensing; and a new Android-based platform to collect sensing data from smart phones, automatically or with user help, and to deliver sensing/actuation tasks to users.",

   "abstract": "This article considers a practical implementation of massive MIMO systems [1]. Although the best performance can be achieved when a large number of active antennas are placed only in the horizontal domain, BS form factor limitation often makes horizontal array placement infeasible. To cope with this limitation, this article introduces full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) cellular wireless communication system, where active antennas are placed in a 2D grid at BSs. For analysis of the FD-MIMO systems, a 3D spatial channel model is introduced, on which system-level simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that the proposed FD-MIMO system with 32 antenna ports achieves 2-3.6 times cell average throughput gain and 1.5-5 times cell edge throughput gain compared to the 4G LTE system of two antenna ports at the BS.",

Most recently, field trials have demonstrated that crosstalk cancellation, also referred to as vectoring, and bonding two pairs to push data rates of very high speed DSL above 100 Mb/s on a single copper pair and above 200 Mb/s on two copper pairs. Looking ahead, the G.fast project group of the ITU-T is currently defining a new copper access technology to provide aggregate (upstream and downstream) data rates of up to 1 Gb/s over distances up to 250 m. This article provides an overview of some key challenges that need to be addressed for G.fast.",

   "abstract": "Current trends in microprocessor architecture design are leading towards a dramatic increase of core-level parallelization, wherein a given number of independent processors or cores are interconnected. Since the main bottleneck is foreseen to migrate from computation to communication, efficient and scalable means of inter-core communication are crucial for guaranteeing steady performance improvements in many-core processors. As the number of cores grows, it remains unclear whether initial proposals, such as the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm, will meet the stringent requirements of this scenario. This position paper presents a new research area where massive multicore architectures have wireless communication capabilities at the core level. This goal is feasible by using graphene-based planar antennas, which can radiate signals at the Terahertz band while utilizing lower chip area than its metallic counterparts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that discusses the utilization of graphene-enabled wireless communication for massive multicore processors. Such wireless systems enable broadcasting, multicasting, all-to-all communication, as well as significantly reduce many of the issues present in massively multicore environments, such as data coherency, consistency, synchronization and communication problems. Several open research challenges are pointed out related to implementation, communications and multicore architectures, which pave the way for future research in this multidisciplinary area.",

   "abstract": "We envision the home populated with regular objects that allow programmatic access to their sensors and actuators. The objects jointly form a pervasive computing platform, open for third-party independently developed applications. A challenge is how to support people in deploying and managing such applications. Today, the user perceives an application as an immaterial artifact, accessed through a screen-based interface of a general-purpose computing device. Contrary to that established paradigm, we propose to reify the pervasive computing application as a simple physical thing, called the \u201capplication pill.\u201d The pill can easily be grasped and operated: the user brings the pill home, switches it on, and checks if it works just by glancing at its on/off diode. As the application is destined for many homes, each featuring a different collection of objects, the user should be provided with high-level feedback on how well the application can work in her home. Accordingly, the application pill is also equipped with a simple \u201cfunctionality level\u201d indicator. The degree to which the application can deliver its functionality on top of an available object collection is captured as a single number and displayed by the pill. We present a concrete proof-of-concept elaboration and implementation of these ideas in a pervasive computing middleware platform targeted at cooperating objects.",

   "abstract": "Heterogeneous small cell networks, or Het- SNets, are considered as a standard part of future mobile networks in which multiple lowpower low-cost user deployed base stations complement the existing macrocell infrastructure. This article proposes an energy-efficient deployment of the cells where the small cell base stations are arranged around the edge of the reference macrocell, and the deployment is referred to as cell-on-edge (COE) deployment. The proposed deployment ensures an increase in the network spectral and energy efficiency by facilitating cell edge mobile users with small cells. Moreover, COE deployment guarantees reduction of the carbon footprint of mobile operations by employing adaptive uplink power control. In order to calibrate the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, this article quantifies the ecological and associated economical impacts of energy savings in the proposed deployment. Simulation results quantify the improvements in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and spectral and energy gains of the proposed COE deployment compared to macro-only networks and typical small cell deployment strategies where small cells are randomly deployed within a given macrocell.",

   "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks, consisting of macrocells overlaid with small cells (e.g., femtocells, picocells, microcells) provide a fast, flexible, cost-efficient, and fine-tuned design and expansion for existing cellular wireless networks to satisfy the ever increasing demand for network capacity. In HetNets, small cells serve as offloading spots in the radio access network to offload users and their associated traffic from congested macrocells. However, due to their large-scale deployment in random locations, limited transmit power, and the lack of complete coordination, the coexistence and efficient operation of small cells is very challenging. In this article, we discuss the coexistence challenges posed to small cells and show that, with cognition capabilities (e.g., achieved through spectrum sensing), small cells can overcome the posed challenges and efficiently coexist in a multitier cellular wireless network. Then we discuss a statistical tool, stochastic geometry, to model and analyze heterogeneous cellular networks. We give two examples where the stochastic geometry tools can be exploited to obtain insightful design guidelines. First, we exploit stochastic geometry to evaluate the load of each network tier and study different offloading techniques used to control this load. Second, we exploit stochastic geometry to maximize frequency reuse efficiency through spectrum sensing design for channel access and compare two channel access techniques based on spectrum sensing.",

   "abstract": "Predictions for wireless and mobile Internet access suggest an exponential traffic increase, particularly in in-building environments. Non-traditional actors such as facility owners have a growing interest in deploying and operating their own indoor networks to fulfill the capacity demand. Such local operators will need spectrum sharing with neighboring networks because they are not likely to have their own dedicated spectrum. Management of internetwork interference then becomes a key issue for high capacity provision. Tight operator-wise cooperation provides superior performance, but at the expense of high infrastructure cost and business-related impairments. Limited coordination, on the other hand, causes harmful interference between operators, which in turn will require even denser networks. In this article, we propose a techno-economic analysis framework for investigating and comparing indoor operator strategies. We refine a traditional network cost model by introducing new inter-operator cost factors. Then we present a numerical example to demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us to compare different operator strategies. Finally, we suggest areas for future research.",

DSP also enables programmability to reconfigure the optics for different applications and link conditions.",

   "abstract": "Interference is one of the most challenging problems in current cellular mobile access networks. Coordinated nultipoint transmission/ reception, and in particular joint processing, has proven to be a beneficial solution for interference management. Most research so far has investigated the requirements and gains on the wireless side but only superficially showed the impact on and requirements for the backhaul network. We take a different approach by looking at different backhaul topologies and technologies, and analyzing how they can support CoMP cooperation schemes. We study, for different traffic scenarios and backhaul connectivity levels, which base station clusters are actually feasible compared to the ones desirable from the radio access network perspective. We found out that a significant mismatch exists between the desired wireless clusters, as defined by the RAN, and feasible ones, as allowed by the given backhaul characteristics. Based on these findings, we explain how RAN clustering and backhaul clustering have to cooperate to come to feasible solutions. As one possible solution, we present a backhaul network preclustering scheme, which is able to predict which BSs are actually eligible for cooperation during the runtime of the network. The gains of this approach are quantifiable in terms of reduced signaling and user data exchange, and reduced MIMO signal processing.",

   "abstract": "Spectrum today is allocated in frequency blocks that serve either licensed or unlicensed services. This static spectrum allocation has limited resources to support the exponential increase in wireless devices. In this article, we present the IEEE 802.11af standard, which defines international specifications for spectrum sharing among unlicensed white space devices (WSDs) and licensed services in the TV white space band. Spectrum sharing is conducted through the regulation of unlicensed WSDs by a geolocation database (GDB), the implementation of which differs among regulatory domains. The main difference between regulatory domains is the timescale in which WSDs are controlled by the GDB, resulting in different TVWS availability and WSD operating parameters. The IEEE 802.11af standard provides a common operating architecture and mechanisms for WSDs to satisfy multiple regulatory domains. This standard opens a new approach to treat spectrum as a single entity shared seamlessly by heterogeneous services.",

The adoption of LEDs is expected to significantly reduce energy consumption and facilitate precise intensity and color control of illuminated spaces. SSL also makes possible the use of visible light communications (VLC), in which data are emitted from luminaires through subtle intensity variations. This article focuses on the impact of lighting requirements on VLC systems, especially as found in indoor deployment scenarios. We also consider dimming control and its impact on color quality in the context of measured vs. perceived light levels.",

   "abstract": "Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.",

In particular, we examine to which extent balancing can increase the throughput guaranteed for an arbitrary traffic pattern. We consider and compare two-phase balancing algorithms which are optimized assuming different underlying routing algorithms. It will be shown that optimized load balancing significantly improves the maximal loss-free throughput.

   "abstract": "The ubiquitous Ethernet has great potential to become an easy-to-install cost-effective backhaul solution for mobile small cells. However, limited Ethernet bandwidth is a practical constraint. Not only is small cell capacity limited by Ethernet bandwidth, but also the synchronization between cells can be substantially compromised. In this article we discuss small cells with Ethernet backhaul, focusing on two practical and important aspects: backhaul bandwidth requirements and tolerance to synchronization errors. The aspects become challenging in indoor small cell applications where the cells need to cooperatively suppress strong interference, producing a large amount of backhaul traffic. To address the challenges, we introduce a new distributed scheme of cooperative small cells over Ethernet. Exploiting a soft information combining technique, the scheme allows the signals of cooperative cells to be combined at aggregate switches along their backhaul paths, reducing backhaul traffic in Ethernet and distributing computational complexity. Our case study shows that the distributed scheme can reduce small cell backhaul traffic by 64 percent, compared to a conventional centralized approach. It is also tolerant to a large frequency error of \u00b14.6 ppm in a freerun state where synchronization is lost. Given the substantially reduced backhaul traffic, the new distributed scheme is able to support three times the cooperative small cells of the conventional centralized approach.",

   "abstract": "Information-centric networking is a communication paradigm where there is no focus on endpoint addressing; rather, it is an attempt to achieve efficient information dissemination by focusing on the content that is distributed. In this article we describe how information-centric networking can be leveraged in order to extend NATO core enterprise services (CES) into the tactical domain. The paradigm can be implemented using decentralized publish/subscribe along with content caching. We present our information-centric middleware, Mist, and perform a comparative evaluation with an existing framework called Haggle. Mist is tailored to mitigate challenges encountered in mobile ad hoc networks. As a proof of concept, we implement a gateway between Mist and WS-Notification, which is the standard used in the Publish/Subscribe CES. This shows that with little effort it is possible to create gateways from networks using Mist to Web services-enabled infrastructure networks, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with higher levels in the chain of command, and also with other nations.",

   "abstract": "A translucent wavelength switched optical network (WSON), with sparse 3R regenerators to guarantee the signal quality of an optical connection, is a promising paradigm for a metro/ core network. This is because a translucent WSON can achieve performance comparable to that of an all-electronic switching (i.e., opaque) network with far lower network cost and a great reduction in power consumption. Because of its advantages, many recent research and standardization efforts have focused on translucent WSONs. However, most of them study the intradomain case, and issues related to multidomain translucent WSONs are largely open at present. In light of this, in this article, we present two possible strategies to improve interdomain path computation and lightpath establishment in a multidomain translucent WSON. Both approaches are experimentally demonstrated and quantitatively evaluated. Our aim is to provide feasible and efficient solutions for supporting a multidomain translucent WSON, as well as to obtain valuable insight into the proposed strategies through experiments, which will be beneficial for the potential industrial deployment of translucent optical networks.",

   "abstract": "The increased usage of net-centric IP applications at the tactical edge has pushed DoD communications systems to maximize bandwidth efficiency amid a limited availability of RF spectrum. One method of increasing bandwidth efficiency (especially with the desire to move to IPv6), is the use of IP header compression (IPHC) to compress headers from the network layer and above into small identifiers before sending to the link layer. Although widely used in cell phone technology, the tactical edge provides some unique challenges to traditional IPHC techniques including highly dynamic links and link conditions due to potential jamming threats and difficult environments, multi-hop scenarios due to lack of infrastructure, and a highly diverse set of radio systems lacking interoperability. In this article, we examine two common IP header compression schemes, Robust Header Compression (RFC 5225) and IP Header Compression (RFC 2507) and one experimental scheme, MANET IP header compression, and identify their current use and applicability in the tactical edge. Furthermore, we identify some challenges in implementing header compression schemes in emerging systems.",

   "abstract": "In September 2013, the VDE 0885-763 standard for high-speed communication over plastic optical fiber (POF) will be published. The new standard enables 1 Gb/s communication over 50 meters of POF and is intended for use in automotive, industrial, and home networking applications. One of the goals of the standard is to achieve good energy efficiency, and to that end it incorporates a low power mode. This is similar to the case of Ethernet where a low-power mode was introduced by the Energy Efficient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az) standard in 2010. In this article, the energy efficiency mechanisms incorporated in the VDE 0885-763 standard are described and evaluated. The evaluation is done by simulation, and the results are also compared to those of Energy Efficient Ethernet. The conclusion is that VDE 0885-763 will provide good energy efficiency even at low/medium loads.",

   "abstract": "Interference in wireless communications is traditionally treated as a cause of performance degradation. Whilst from a statistical viewpoint this is entirely justified, this article discusses scenarios where the interfering signal enhances the desired signal's useful power on an instantaneous basis and provides an unexplored source of additional signal power. The potential of harvesting this energy, which naturally exists in the communication system, is shown to be readily available in downlink systems where interference can be predicted. The main concept discussed is that instead of using knowledge of the interference to cancel, eliminate or avoid it, it is potentially more fruitful to use this knowledge to manipulate and make use of the interference towards the system's advantage. A significant source of useful signal power, which with conventional transmission techniques is left unexploited, can be used to improve the radio systems' performance and achieve reliable power-efficient communications where performance benefits are yielded without the need to increase the average transmitted power.",

The ability of the first responder emergency services to communicate among themselves and to share multimedia information directly affects the ability to save lives.

   "abstract": "As the specification of Release 11 of the LTE standards is approaching its completion, 3GPP is gradually moving its focus toward the next major step in the evolution of LTE. The drivers of the LTE evolution include the increasing demand for mobile broadband services and traffic volumes as well as emerging usage scenarios involving short-range and machine-type communications. In this article we provide an overview of the key technology areas/components that are currently considered by 3GPP for Rel-12, including support for further enhanced local area access by tight interaction between the wide area and local area layers, signaling solutions for wireless local area network integration, multi-antenna enhancements, improved support for massive MTC, and direct device-to-device communications.",

   "abstract": "Wireless communications technologies play an essential role to support the Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) operational needs. The current Private/Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) technologies used for PPDR communications offer a rich set of voice-centric services but have very limited data transmission capabilities, which are unable to handle the increasing PPDR community demand for a wider range of data-centric services. Though some efforts have been devoted to upgrade PMR technologies with better data transfer capabilities, the progression towards an enhanced mobile broadband PMR standardized solution still lags behind the achievements made in the commercial wireless industry, which recently culminated in Long- Term Evolution (LTE) technology. Because of this contrasting progress, the adoption of commercial mainstream LTE technology to satisfy the PPDR community's data communication needs is gaining momentum and offers significant opportunities to create and exploit the synergies between the commercial and PPDR domains, which have remained almost entirely separate to date. In this context, this paper first discusses the suitability of LTE and related technologies for mobile broadband PPDR service provisioning. Next, it presents the argument that the most plausible future scenarios to deliver the increasingly data-intensive applications demanded by the PPDR agencies are expected to rely on the use of both dedicated and commercial LTE-based mobile networks. From this basis, the paper proposes a system architecture solution for PPDR service provisioning that enables PPDR service access through dedicated and commercial networks in a secure and interoperable manner and ensures proper allocation of the networks' capacity to PPDR applications through the dynamic management of prioritization policies. In addition, the spectrumrelated issues that are central to the proposed PPDR service provisioning solution are addressed, and a solution based on the joint exploitation of dedicated and shared spectra is proposed.",

   "abstract": "Modern computer networks perform a bewildering array of tasks, from routing and traffic monitoring, to access control and server load balancing. However, managing these networks is unnecessarily complicated and error-prone, due to a heterogeneous mix of devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, and middleboxes) with closed and proprietary configuration interfaces. Softwaredefined networks are poised to change this by offering a clean and open interface between networking devices and the software that controls them. In particular, many commercial switches support the OpenFlow protocol, and a number of campus, data center, and backbone networks have deployed the new technology. However, while SDNs make it possible to program the network, they does not make it easy. Today's OpenFlow controllers offer low-level APIs that mimic the underlying switch hardware. To reach SDNs full potential, we need to identify the right higher-level abstractions for creating (and composing) applications. In the Frenetic project, we are designing simple and intuitive abstractions for programming the three main stages of network management: monitoring network traffic, specifying and composing packet forwarding policies, and updating policies in a consistent way. Overall, these abstractions make it dramatically easier for programmers to write and reason about SDN applications.",

   "abstract": "The rapid growth of smart grid systems demands efficient management of smart grid services. Smart grids are expected to enable the delivery and management of electricity in a more reliable, efficient, economical, and secured manner. Thus, the development of effective power management solutions for smart grids to meet these challenges is an important area of research in recent times. In this article, we propose using learning automata (LA), a computational learning utility, for efficient power management in smart grids (LAPM). The proposed system, LAPM, helps in identifying the electricity required for various distribution substations and controls the usage of power by various devices (i.e., preventing unauthorized use of power). The use of LA enables performing a dynamic analysis of power usage and providing decision making for its effective usage. The system is evaluated on a real-life-resembling environment, with respect to parameters such as power utilization and customer satisfaction.",

   "abstract": "Inertial sensors based on MEMS technology are fast becoming ubiquitous with their adoption into many types of consumer electronics products, including smart phones, tablets, gaming systems, TV remotes, toys, and even (more recently) power tools and wearable sensors. Now a standard feature of most smart phones, MEMS-based motion tracking enhances the user interface by allowing response to user motions, complements the GPS receiver by providing dead-reckoning indoor navigation and supporting location-based services, and holds the promise of enabling handset optical image stabilization in next-generation handsets by virtue of its lower cost and small form factor. This tutorial provides an overview of MEMS technology and describes the essential features of the mechanical systems underlying the most common sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes. It also highlights some fundamental trade-offs related to mechanical system dynamics, force and charge transduction methods, and their implications for the mixed-signal systems that process the sensor outputs. The presentation of an energy-based metric allows a comparison of the performance of competing sensor solutions. For each type of sensor, descriptions of the underlying mechanical theory, canonical sensor architectures, and key design challenges are also presented. Finally, the tutorial reviews multisensor silicon MEMS/CMOS monolithic integration, which is driving the cost and form factor reduction behind the current proliferation of these devices.",

   "abstract": "An evaluation of the potential for MEMS technologies to realize the RF front-end frequency gating spectrum analyzer function needed by true software-defined cognitive radios and ultra-low-power autonomous sensor network radios is presented. Here, RF channel selection, as opposed to band selection that removes all interferers, even those in band, and passes only the desired channel, is key to substantial potential increases in call volume with simultaneous reductions in power consumption. The relevant MEMS technologies most conducive to RF channel- selecting front-ends include vibrating micromechanical resonators that exhibit record on-chip Qs at gigahertz frequencies; resonant switches that provide extremely efficient switched-mode power gain for both transmit and receive paths; medium-scale integrated micromechanical circuits that implement on/off switchable filter-amplifier banks; and fabrication technologies that integrate MEMS together with foundry CMOS transistors in a fully monolithic low-capacitance single-chip process. The many issues that make realization of RF channel selection a truly challenging proposition include resonator drift stability, mechanical circuit complexity, repeatability and fabrication tolerances, and the need for resonators at gigahertz frequencies with simultaneous high \u03a9 (&gt;30,000) and low impedance (e.g., 50 W for conventional systems). Some perspective on which resonator technologies might best achieve these simultaneous attributes is provided.",

   "abstract": "DVB-NGH (Digital Video Broadcasting - Next Generation Handheld) is the next generation technology for mobile TV broadcasting, which has been developed by the DVB project with the most advanced transmission technologies. DVB-NGH is the first broadcasting standard to incorporate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) as the key technology to overcome the Shannon limit of single antenna communications. MIMO techniques can be used to improve the robustness of the transmitted signal by exploiting the spatial diversity of the MIMO channel, but also to achieve increased data rates through spatial multiplexing. This article describes the benefits of MIMO that motivated its incorporation in DVB-NGH, reviews the MIMO schemes adopted, and discusses some aspects related to the deployment of MIMO networks in DVB-NGH. The article also provides a feature comparison with the multi-antenna techniques for 3GGP's LTE/LTE-Advanced for cellular networks. Finally, physical layer simulation results calibrated within the DVB-NGH standardization process are provided to illustrate the gain of MIMO for the next generation of mobile TV broadcasting.",

   "abstract": "The interest in quantum-based security methods has been growing rapidly in recent years. New implementations of quantum key distribution and new network services supported by this solution are being introduced. The reason behind the growing popularity of quantum cryptography is its unrivaled security level: all eavesdroppers can be revealed through the application of the laws of physics. First of all, the rules of quantum mechanics ensure that any measurement modifies the state of the transmitted quantum bit. This modification can be discovered by the sender and the receiver. This makes passive eavesdropping impossible. Using protocols such as BB84, network users are able to send a string of bits coded by the polarized photons. After that, they can establish secure cryptographic keys through an unsecure channel using different key distillation methods. Major ongoing challenges include the control and management of security in systems using quantum cryptography, as well as tailoring security to specific end user's requirements and services.",

   "abstract": "As the number and variety of applications and workloads moving to the cloud grows, networking capabilities have become increasingly important. Over a brief period, networking support offered by both cloud service providers and cloud controller platforms has developed rapidly. In most of these cloud networking service models, however, users must configure a variety of network-layer constructs such as switches, subnets, and ACLs, which can then be used by their cloud applications. In this article, we argue for a service-level network model that provides higher- level connectivity and policy abstractions that are integral parts of cloud applications. Moreover, the emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm provides a new opportunity to closely integrate application provisioning in the cloud with the network through programmable interfaces and automation. We describe the architecture and implementation of Meridian, an SDN controller platform that supports a service-level model for application networking in clouds. We discuss some of the key challenges in the design and implementation, including how to efficiently handle dynamic updates to virtual networks, orchestration of network tasks on a large set of devices, and how Meridian can be integrated with multiple cloud controllers.",

   "abstract": "We present a generic step-by-step methodology for evaluating the total cost of migrating from a capacity-exhausted WDM network to different upgraded alternatives. The presented methodology is the first effort to provide a generic evaluation framework (allowing the evaluation of scenarios with different traffic growth rates, optical technologies, network architectures, and resource allocation algorithms) that considers both capital and operational expenditures of the upgraded alternatives to then identify the lowest-cost option. Previous works have just evaluated specific scenarios or only CapEx or OpEx (not both). As a way of illustration, the proposed methodology was applied to compare the migration cost of two upgrading scenarios. The methodology allowed identifying the lowest-cost alternative, categorizing the key cost factors of CapEx and OpEx, and evaluating its impact on the migration cost. Surprisingly, results for the study case presented show that migrating to an automatically provisioned network does not necessarily lead to cost savings.",

Mobile relay technology which features on-board relay node is expected to improve the quality of service for passengers. However, the design for fixed relay in LTE-Advanced system cannot meet the requirements of mobile relay. In this article, the architecture for mobile relay is presented. The key techniques of supporting mobile relay are investigated, such as the group mobility, the local service support, the multi-RAT and RAN sharing, with the corresponding solutions. The potential system optimization, for example, the self-optimization network, power saving, measurement and system information acquisition are also presented where the efficiency of mobile relay can further be improved. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of the mobile relay.",

   "abstract": "The next generation of cellular communication needs to endure a higher demand for enhanced real-time multimedia support to end users. Among interactive video applications, use of mobile video chat is on the rise in both the enterprise and consumer worlds. Mobile video chats are resource-constrained and heterogenous with varying display sizes, processing powers, network conditions, and battery levels, and pose real-time delivery constraints unlike traditional video streaming applications. With the demand for anywhere any time connectivity for video chat, it becomes quintessential to develop techniques that adapt to the underlying network, optimize the device architectures, and provide the best possible video chat experience to end users. In this article, we identify main limitations and challenges in mobile video chat. We further discuss possible solutions and propose research directions to make video chat a good experience.",

   "abstract": "The advances in wireless communications and mobile devices have resulted in a massive growth of the video services over mobile networks. In this article, we study the potential of peer-assisted video delivery in WiFi mobile networks aimed at reducing servers\u00bf load. Our study is based on a real measurement of mobile video viewing logs from a leading Internet video provider for 14 days. We analyze viewing behavior of users with respect to three main factors for the design of peer-assisted delivery network: viewing time, user population, and user locality. We then discuss the implications of the observations. Finally, we apply the findings on a BitTorrent-like VoD system and perform experiments with the collected viewing logs to demonstrate the benefits of peer-assisted video delivery. The peer assistance can reduce the servers\u00bf load by as much as 50 percent for popular videos on average.",

   "abstract": "Mobile carrier networks follow an architecture where network elements and their interfaces are defined in detail through standardization, but provide limited ways to develop new network features once deployed. In recent years we have witnessed rapid growth in over-the-top mobile applications and a 10-fold increase in subscriber traffic while ground-breaking network innovation took a back seat. We argue that carrier networks can benefit from advances in computer science and pertinent technology trends by incorporating a new way of thinking in their current toolbox. This article introduces a blueprint for implementing current as well as future network architectures based on a software-defined networking approach. Our architecture enables operators to capitalize on a flow-based forwarding model and fosters a rich environment for innovation inside the mobile network. In this article, we validate this concept in our wireless network research laboratory, demonstrate the programmability and flexibility of the architecture, and provide implementation and experimentation details.",

   "abstract": "In this article we first summarize some of the most recent HetNet mobility studies for LTEAdvanced, and use these to highlight the challenges that should be further addressed in the research community. A state-of-the-art HetNet scenario with macros and small cells deployed on different carriers, while using inter-site carrier aggregation, is hereafter studied. Hybrid Het- Net mobility solutions for such cases are derived, where macrocell mobility is network controlled, while small-cell mobility is made UE-autonomous. The proposed scheme is characterized by having the UE devices autonomously decide small cell addition, removal, and change without any explicit signaling of measurement events to the network or any signaling of hand - over commands from the network. Hence, the proposed solution effectively offloads the network from having to perform frequent small cell handoff decisions, and reduces the signaling overhead compared to known network controlled mobility solutions. Results from extensive dynamic system-level simulations are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique, showing significant savings in signaling overhead.",

   "abstract": "The large increase in size and complexity experienced by cellular networks in recent years has led to a new paradigm known as heterogeneous networks, or HetNets. In this context, networks with different cell sizes, radio access technologies, or carrier frequencies can be deployed in the same environment. As the coverage area of each of these networks is typically overlapped, operators have some degree of freedom to modify user distributions across the networks (i.e., traffic steering) in order to improve network performance. This article introduces different mechanisms of traffic steering in HetNets, clarifying the specific goals that operators can set and focusing on those techniques that adjust mobility parameters, which are typically more attractive to achieve these goals. In addition, some challenging issues arising from particular HetNet deployments are discussed and illustrated by example use cases, which are applicable to an early stage of LTE deployment. Finally, a fuzzy-logic-based algorithm that optimizes network parameters for traffic steering is proposed.",

   "abstract": "Resilience of networking infrastructures is crucial for ensuring protection and readiness in the case of an emergency. Enabling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication is one way of alleviating potential outcomes of depending on a centralized system with a single point of failure, which would be hard to recover in the case of cyberattack. In this article, we consider P2P-enabled networks and discuss how it is possible to benefit from social centrality metrics to prevent catastrophic spreading of malicious content. Using classical Susceptible-Infected- Recovered (SIR) simulation models designed for disease propagation in a social community on two different reallife P2P network topologies, we demonstrate that the nodes that are ranked highly by social centrality metrics should be better protected to prevent malicious content propagation. Our results suggest that nodes that are central are significantly more effective than random nodes in spreading malicious content across the network and among different centrality metrics, Eigenvector centrality is more useful for identifying the nodes that should be better protected in P2P networks.",

   "abstract": "In future wireless networks, a significant number of users accessing wireless broadband will be vehicular (i.e., in public transportation vehicles like buses, trams, or trains). The Third Generation Partnership Project has started to investigate how to serve these vehicular users cost-effectively, and several solutions have been proposed. One promising solution is to deploy a moving relay node (MRN), on a public transportation vehicle that forms its own cell inside the vehicle to serve vehicular users. By proper antenna placement, an MRN can reduce or even eliminate the vehicular penetration loss that affects communication. Moreover, MRNs can exploit various smart antenna techniques and advanced signal processing schemes, as they are less limited by size and power than regular user equipment. However, there are also challenges in using MRNs, such as designing efficient interference management techniques as well as proper mobility management schemes to exploit the benefit of group handovers for vehicular UE devices served by the same MRN. Nevertheless, initial system-level evaluation results indicate that a dedicated MRN deployment shows great potential to improve the vehicular user experience, and thereby can potentially bring significant benefits to future wireless communication systems.",

   "abstract": "Lack of non-repudiation is a major barrier of building a trustworthy smart grid. In current power systems, bills are generated based on the amount of service consumed by residential or commercial users. However, meter readings may not be trustworthy due to malicious behavior (e.g., energy theft) or external attacks. The root cause is that power providers have no means to obtain the reading value other than receiving it from the users. To resolve this issue, we present a mutual inspection strategy, which enables nonrepudiation on meter readings for smart grid. The goal of our scheme is to discover problematic meters that report inaccurate reading values.",

   "abstract": "Traditional wireless networks are designed for ubiquitous network access provision with low-rate voice services, which thus preserve the homogeneous architecture and tight coupling for infrastructures such as base stations. With the traffic explosion and the paradigm shift from voice-oriented services to data-oriented services, traditional homogeneous architecture no longer maintains its optimality, and heterogeneous deployment with flexible network control capability becomes a promising evolution direction. To achieve this goal, in this article, we propose a two-layer network functionality separation scheme, targeting at low control signaling overhead and flexible network reconfiguration for future mobile networks. The proposed scheme is shown to support all kinds of user activities defined in current networks. Moreover, we give two examples to illustrate how the proposed scheme can be applied to multicarrier networks and suggest two important design principles for future green networks.

   "abstract": "The Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN) is a promising access architecture that combines the high performance of optical networks with the ubiquity and convenience of wireless technologies. This article proposes a network-based mobility framework that is specially tailored for WOBANs. The proposed architecture is based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 and IEEE 802.21 mobility management protocols, but it also defines a number of optimizations that enable the seamless handover of mobile nodes. In particular, the hierarchical architecture together with the broadcast-and-select nature of the optical part of the WOBAN are leveraged to: optimize the mobility of users with respect to the overall network resources, both at the wireless access and optical distribution parts, remove the overhead of IP-in-IP tunneling between the PMIPv6 entities, and perform an efficient bicasting during the handover process to minimize packet loss.",

   "abstract": "Cybersecurity is an important but usually not adequately addressed area in the smart grid. Its standardization is also relatively immature. The NISTIR 7628 seems to be a comprehensive document for security designers/practitioners in smart grid research and practice. However, the NISTIR 7628 security framework might still be insufficient to specify the requirements of a secure smart grid system. More specifically, the EV charging infrastructure is used to study the effectiveness of the NISTIR 7628 framework in specifying security criteria, and the resulting security assurance. Two weaknesses, one in addressing node or device authentication and the other in location privacy of EV owners, are found for a system satisfying all the security requirements stipulated by the NISTIR 7628, thus illustrating the subtlety of applying the NISTIR 7628.",

   "abstract": "The growing interest in integrating interactive multimedia features into web applications has recently led to the creation of the W3C WebRTC and the IETF RTCWEB working groups. Such groups are jointly defining both the application programming interfaces and the underlying communication protocols for the setup and management of a reliable communication path between any pair of next-generation web browsers. While the ongoing work is focusing on peer-to-peer communication between browsers, engineers are also facing a new issue, associated with the coexistence of legacy SIPbased systems with the upcoming browserenabled architectures. We herein discuss how we tackled such an issue, by first identifying interoperability requirements and then presenting a real-world interoperability example dealing with the integration of RTCWEB clients into an existing standards-based collaboration platform.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radio networks hold the key to achieving better radio bandwidth utilization and improving the quality of wireless applications. The next step in this fast emerging paradigm is the multi-hop cognitive radio network. Well designed multi-hop cognitive radio networks can provide high bandwidth efficiency by using dynamic spectrum access technologies as well as provide extended coverage and ubiquitous connectivity for the wireless end users. However, the special features of multi-hop cognitive radio networks also raise several unique design challenges. In this article, we survey these unique challenges and open research issues in the design of multi-hop cognitive radio networks as well as discuss potential approaches to address these challenges. This article specifically focuses on the medium access control (MAC) and network layers of the multi-hop cognitive radio protocol stack. Issues considered include efficient spectrum sharing, optimal relay node selection, interference mitigation, end-to-end delay, etc.",

   "abstract": "We propose a signaling architecture for network traffic authorization, called Permission-Based Sending (PBS), aiming to prevent DoS attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic. Toward this goal, PBS takes a hybrid approach: a proactive approach of explicit permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering attacks. PBS uses a concept similar to existing capability-based systems in the manner in which the sender should get authorization (permission) from a receiver for flows. However, PBS introduces new and practical approaches to overcome the deficiencies (the difficulty of obtaining permission and incompatibility with current network architecture) of those systems. On-path signaling enables easy installation and management of the permission state. Working on current network protocols supports compatibility and allows PBS to be deployed in existing networks. In addition, a monitoring mechanism provides a second line of defense against attacks. Our analysis and performance evaluation show that PBS is an effective and scalable solution to prevent several kinds of attacks, and improves the resilience of the system against network failure by using soft-state mechanisms.",

Then we propose a control plane architecture and study its performance. Filterless networks act as passive broadcast and select networks, in which active switching elements, such as the wavelength selection switch, are replaced by passive optical splitters and combiners, and network agility is provided by tunable transceivers. We introduce the concept of unfiltered channels and that of backward and forward ports, and show how they impact topological performance, and, in particular, the fact that wavelength usage increases greatly as the protection ratio shrinks.",

Obtained results show that packet dispersion techniques can fail drastically in their estimates due to specific features of the 802.16 standard, generally enabled by default to increase throughput. Furthermore, we speculate possible changes in the packet pair (and train) techniques to solve (or mitigate) the problems that must be considered in the development of a new technique to estimate the end-to-end bottleneck capacities WiMAX links.",

   "abstract": "3D video is destined to be available in homes and mobile devices. Stereoscopic TV broadcasts have already begun in frame-compatible format for stereoscopic 3D. The natural next step is to deliver 3D content in the form of multiview video (MVV) that enables a natural glasses-free 3D experience. Unfortunately, the number of views needed to drive multiview displays varies depending on the price vs. quality trade-off. Therefore, the bitrate requirement of MVV content changes according to users' display technology, making transmission over fixed bit rate channels inefficient. IP provides a flexible transport mechanism for 3D content; however, wellknown problems such as fluctuations in available link capacity and varying transmission delays pose challenges to 3D video services over the Internet. In this study, we discuss quality-ofexperience- aware rate adaptation methods specific to 3D video and efficient encoding schemes. Then, we introduce a framework to design P2P overlays to deliver 3D video. P2P overlays offer a promising approach to alleviate the high bandwidth requirement of MVV. Furthermore, two use case scenarios are provided to show the discussed methods can help to make 3D video delivery practical over the Internet.",

   "abstract": "Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB) is the most commonly used method to support voice services over Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks today, as the deployment of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is still in its infancy. In this article, we discuss the performance of CSFB voice traffic redirection from LTE to UMTS using data from live commercial networks. The key factors impacting CSFB call setup delay are highlighted. Data from multiple cell geometries including stationary and mobility conditions are presented for Mobile Originated (MO) calls towards landlines, Mobile Terminated (MT) calls from landlines and Mobile-to-Mobile (M2M) CSFB calls. Analysis results in well optimized deployments show that on an average, MO/MT call-setup time for CSFB from LTE to UMTS is around 1 sec greater than legacy UMTS. However, the results can vary depending on the network configuration and the conditions of the measurement. To illustrate the optimization of CSFB performance in real networks, we also highlight the principal call set up optimization and implementation factors impacting CSFB call setup delay and success rates. This article demonstrates that in well optimized networks, CSFB to UMTS call setup success rates can be very close to those achieved in the legacy UMTS systems.",

   "abstract": "Smart homes and environments will consist of a large number of low power wireless devices such as sensors and actuators. Recently IETF standardized a network protocol called RPL that is designed to run on these nodes. In this article, we study the performance of RPL on a variety of scenarios that these nodes will encounter when they are deployed in practice. We deploy a network of 23 sensor nodes in a computer lab to monitor energy used by each computer across the applications and users. We subject the network to four different levels of interference that are representative of the types and levels of interference that these networks might encounter in deployment. Our study finds that RPL reliability degrades even with an access point in overlapping channel under normal network traffic. With high interference, the packet delivery reliability goes down to 10 percent. The scenario that resulted in this performance is not unimaginable in smart home or environment. This performance degradation is partly due to lack of coordination across the layers of the protocol stack: RPL is unaware of the changes in the wireless environment underneath and proceeds as usual. As other research has shown, coordination across the network stack is essential for network protocols to work reliably in the presence of interference. This will require a more coordinated approach to standards across the bodies.",

   "abstract": "The reforms in spectrum management aim toward more efficient, flexible, and shared use of spectrum, while fostering innovation and competition in mobile communications. The goal is to have affordable wireless broadband and make Internet access a human right. To achieve this goal, the regulators need to identify, evaluate, and decide between the different spectrum access models. This article presents a taxonomy of the models, which is based on priorities between the different users of spectrum. For example, the low priority systems may be allowed to use the spectrum only if the high priority systems are not occupying the frequency. The hierarchy of the systems can be implemented using different technologies such as centralized databases or distributed sensing devices. The taxonomy clarifies the regulatory alternatives and emphasizes the differences in ownership and usage rights. The new models can be incorporated in the auction design in order to estimate their value to the companies, and this reflects the recent trend of supporting spectrum management with market- based methods.",

   "abstract": "Vehicles are equipped with more technology with each passing day. Acronyms such as ABS (anti-lock braking system), EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution) or EPS (electric power steering) have become commonplace, and are used as synonyms for safety and comfort. On the contrary, others like EDR (event data recorder) are not as popular. EDR, commonly known as automotive black boxes, are devices used to collect data about a vehicle and its occupants, which can be accessed after an accident to clarify its cause. With the upcoming regulation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requiring manufacturers to include EDR in all new vehicles, privacy advocates have raised some alarms related to the storage of and access to these data. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-aware solution for the EDR of modern vehicles. Our solution is based on modern cryptographic primitives like timed release encryption (TRE), and it guarantees the privacy of the vehicle's occupants while allowing the full functionality of EDR in case of emergency.",

   "abstract": "A body area network is a radio communication protocol for short-range, low-power, and highly reliable wireless communication for use on the surface, inside, or in the peripheral proximity of the human body. Combined with various biomedical sensors, BANs enable realtime collection and monitoring of physiological signals. Therefore, it is regarded as an important technology for the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases, and health monitoring of the elderly. The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee approved Task Group TG15.6 in December 2007. As a result of more than four years of effort, in February 2012, TG15.6 published the first international standard for BANs, IEEE Std 802.15.6. Throughout the development of this standard, ample collaboration between the standardization group and the research community was required. In particular, understanding the radio propagation mechanisms for BANs demanded the most research effort. Technical challenges were magnified for the case of implant communication because of the impossibility of conducting in-body measurements with human subjects. Therefore, research in this field had to make use of intricate computer simulations. This article outlines some of the research that has been done to obtain accurate propagation models supporting the standardization of implant communication in BANs. Current research to enhance the channel models of IEEE Std 802.15.6 through the use of ultra wideband signals for implantable devices along with physical measurements in animals is also presented.",

   "abstract": "Performance problem diagnosis is a critical part of network operations in ISPs. Service providers use a combination of approaches to troubleshoot performance of their networks, such as active monitoring infrastructure and data collection (SNMP, Netflow, router logs, table dumps, etc.) along with customer trouble tickets. Some of these approaches, however, do not scale to wide area inter-domain networks due to unavailability of such data; moreover, troubleshooting is either reactive (e.g., driven by customer complaints) or (typically) automated using static thresholds. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of a system for root cause analysis and localization of performance problems in ISP networks. Our approach works with legacy monitoring infrastructure (e.g., perfSONAR deployments) and does not need specialized active probing tools or network data. Our system provides a language for network operators to define performance problem signatures, and provides near-real-time performance diagnosis and localization. We describe our deployment of Pythia in perfSONAR monitors in production networks in Georgia, covering over 250 inter-domain paths.",

This effort is well supported by the increasing 3D video content including user generated content (e.g., through 3D capture/display enabled mobile phones), technological advancements (e.g., HD 3D video capture and processing methods), affordable 3D displays, and standardization activities. However, not much attention has been given to how these technologies, along the end-to-end chain from content capture to display, affect user perception and whether the overall experience of 3D video users is satisfactory or not. 3D video streaming also introduces artifacts on the reconstructed 3D video at the receiver end, leading to inferior quality and user experience. In this article we present and discuss in detail how artifacts introduced during 3D video streaming affect the end-user perception and how we could use realtime quality evaluation methodologies to overcome these effects. The observations presented can underpin the design of future QoE-aware 3D video streaming systems.",

To assist Communications Society members with this transition, we provide a pragmatic description of quantum communications theory that introduces the quantum mechanical properties of polarization and entanglement, which do not have analogs in classical communications theory. We show plausible examples of how these quantum properties may be exploited to create noisefree channels and to improve channel utilization for distributed MAC protocols. Finally, we describe how entanglement is used to enhance security and improve key distribution efficiency in symmetric-key cryptography systems used by operational quantum cryptographic networks.",

   "abstract": "The physical layer describes how communication signals are encoded and transmitted across a channel. Physical security often requires either restricting access to the channel or performing periodic manual inspections. In this tutorial, we describe how the field of quantum communication offers new techniques for securing the physical layer. We describe the use of quantum seals as a unique way to test the integrity and authenticity of a communication channel and to provide security for the physical layer. We present the theoretical and physical underpinnings of quantum seals including the quantum optical encoding used at the transmitter and the test for non-locality used at the receiver. We describe how the envisioned quantum physical sublayer senses tampering and how coordination with higher protocol layers allows quantum seals to influence secure routing or tailor data management methods. We conclude by discussing challenges in the development of quantum seals, the overlap with existing quantum key distribution cryptographic services, and the relevance of a quantum physical sublayer to the future of communication security.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a survey of cellular network sharing, which is a key building block for virtualizing future mobile carrier networks in order to address the explosive capacity demand of mobile traffic, and reduce the CAPEX and OPEX burden faced by operators to handle this demand. We start by reviewing the 3GPP network sharing standardized functionality followed by a discussion on emerging business models calling for additional features. Then an overview of the RAN sharing enhancements currently being considered by the 3GPP RSE Study Item is presented. Based on the developing network sharing needs, a summary of the state of the art of mobile carrier network virtualization is provided, encompassing RAN sharing as well as a higher level of base station programmability and customization for the sharing entities. As an example of RAN virtualization techniques feasibility, a solution based on spectrum sharing is presented: the network virtualization substrate (NVS), which can be natively implemented in base stations. NVS performance is evaluated in an LTE network by means of simulation, showing that it can meet the needs of future virtualized mobile carrier networks in terms of isolation, utilization, and customization.",

   "abstract": "Latest regulations on TV white space communications and emerging trends of spectrum access through geolocation databases relax the regulatory constraints on Cognitive Radios (CRs). Geolocation databases are designed to store information related to incumbents, and CRs are envisioned to consult this database before spectrum access. Spectrum occupancy and related environment information can be constructed using these geolocation databases. In that regard, Radio Environment Map (REM) is a promising tool that provides a practical means for the realization of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). It constructs a comprehensive map of the CRN by utilizing multi-domain information from geolocation databases, characteristics of spectrum use, geographical terrain models, propagation environment, and regulations. REMs contribute to cognition engines by building long-term knowledge via processing spectrum measurements collected from sensors to estimate the state of locations where there is no measurement data. In addition, REM utilizes feedback from the CRs and can apply various learning tools. The vision is to design CRNs such that CRs, though being simple devices without advanced cognitive functionalities, can become cognitive via REMs and operate in an efficient manner. In this paper, an overview of the REM concept is presented in various dimensions ranging from its architecture and stored information to REM construction techniques as well as REM quality metrics.",

   "abstract": "Machine-to-machine communication, a promising technology for the smart city concept, enables ubiquitous connectivity between one or more autonomous devices without or with minimal human interaction. M2M communication is the key technology to support data transfer among sensors and actuators to facilitate various smart city applications (e.g., smart metering, surveillance and security, infrastructure management, city automation, and eHealth). To support massive numbers of machine type communication (MTC) devices, one of the challenging issues is to provide an efficient way for multiple access in the network and to minimize network overload. In this article, we review the M2M communication techniques in Long Term Evolution- Advanced cellular networks and outline the major research issues. Also, we review the different random access overload control mechanisms to avoid congestion caused by random channel access of MTC devices. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based eNB selection algorithm that allows the MTC devices to choose the eNBs (or base stations) to transmit packets in a self-organizing fashion.",

   "abstract": "We discuss the emerging rate-adaptable optical transmission technology and how this new technology may be employed to further reduce the transport network cost to meet ever growing bandwidth demand in the core network. Two different types of transponders are considered: those adjusting either the transported bit rate (i.e., client data rate) or the symbol rate (with a fixed bit rate). We propose a methodology for calculating the (normalized) cost to build out an entire long-haul transport network with several options for bit-rate-adaptable transponders. By using link-length demands from an exemplary distance-diverse network, we demonstrate that time-domain hybrid-QAM-enabled fine-grain rate-adaptable transponders can reduce network cost by more than 20 percent within a traditional, fixed-bandwidth, wavelength-division-multiplexed grid. We also argue that the total transponder expense using symbol-rate-adaptable technology will be greater than when using bit-rate-adaptable technology, as well as requiring more costly flex-grid ROADMs for channel routing.",

   "abstract": "Recently, the mobile communication industry is moving rapidly toward Long Term Evolution, or LTE, systems. The leading carriers and vendors are committed to launching LTE service in the near future; in fact, a number of major operators such as Verizon have initiated LTE service already. LTE aims to provide improved service quality over 3G systems in terms of throughput, spectral efficiency, latency, and peak data rate, and the MIMO technique is one of the key enablers of the LTE system for achieving these diverse goals. Among several operational modes of MIMO, multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO), in which the base station transmits multiple streams to multiple users, has received much attention as a way of achieving improvement in performance. From the initial release (Rel. 8) to the recent release (Rel. 10), so called LTE-Advanced, MUMIMO techniques have evolved from their premature form to a more elaborate version. In this article, we provide an overview of design challenges and the specific solutions for MU-MIMO systems developed in the LTE-Advanced standard.",

   "abstract": "Cloud computing is a utility computing paradigm that has become a solid base for a wide array of enterprise and end-user applications. Providers offer varying service portfolios that differ in resource configurations and provided services. A comprehensive solution for resource allocation is fundamental to any cloud computing service provider. Any resource allocation model has to consider computational resources as well as network resources to accurately reflect practical demands. Another aspect that should be considered while provisioning resources is energy consumption. This aspect is getting more attention from industrial and government parties. Calls for the support of green clouds are gaining momentum. With that in mind, resource allocation algorithms aim to accomplish the task of scheduling virtual machines on the servers residing in data centers and consequently scheduling network resources while complying with the problem constraints. Several external and internal factors that affect the performance of resource allocation models are introduced in this article. These factors are discussed in detail, and research gaps are pointed out. Design challenges are discussed with the aim of providing a reference to be used when designing a comprehensive energy-aware resource allocation model for cloud computing data centers.",

   "abstract": "Data rates of mobile communications have increased dramatically during the last decade. The industry predicts an exponential increase of data traffic that would correspond to a 1000-fold increase in traffic between 2010 and 2020. These figures are very similar to ones reported during the last Internet boom. In this article we assess the realism of these assumptions. We conjecture that wireless and mobile Internet access will emerge as a dominant technology. A necessary prerequisite for this development is that wireless access is abundant and becomes (almost) free. A consequence is that the projected capacity increase must be provided at the same cost and energy consumption as today. We explore technical and architectural solutions that have realistic possibility to achieve these targets. We ask if Moore's law, which has successfully predicted the tremendous advances in computing and signal processing, will also save the day for high-speed wireless access. We argue that further improvements of the PHY layer are possible, but it is unlikely that this alone provides a viable path. The exponential traffic increase has to be matched mainly by increasing the density of the access networks as well as providing a modest amount of extra spectrum. Thus, the future research challenges are in designing energy- and cost-efficient short-range architectures and systems that support super-dense deployments. A non-technical complication is that such infrastructures are likely to lead to highly fragmented markets with a large number of operators and infrastructure owners.",

   "abstract": "This article presents a radio interface recently standardized by ETSI under the name of S-band Mobile Interactive Multimedia (S-MIM) and especially designed to provide ubiquitous messaging services over S-band GEO satellites using low-power terminals. Thanks to low terminal cost and high bandwidth efficiency, this standard allows the development of new satellite services, particularly for vehicular and machine-to machine applications. The S-MIM standard relies on a broadcasting radio interface such as DVB-SH or ETSI SDR in the forward link, and reuses 3GPP W-CDMA technology properly adapted to the scope in the return link. Thanks to the use of spread spectrum ALOHA, terminals can access the channel in a totally asynchronous manner. The use of a packet-optimized iterative successive interference cancellation (i- SIC) algorithm at the receiver allows exploiting the inherent power imbalance among terminals in order to boost the throughput with respect to conventional SSA systems. In addition, advanced packet transmission control techniques have been adopted to maximize the probability of successful packet reception in the challenging land mobile satellite channel. Finally, the S-MIM link layer provides efficient and reliable transport of IP datagrams over the forward and return link radio interfaces.",

   "abstract": "The micro grid is a small intelligent electricity network (power grid) that uses computer technology to optimize production, distribution, and consumption and can operate independently by managing \"intelligently\" its own expenses and production capacity. The main objective is to ensure the best user perception without any human monitoring based on effective needs and better use. To do so, we need a control mechanism to drive the microgrid. In this article, we propose a new easily deployable framework called SMILAY based on two key ideas: a hierarchical architecture and a service-specific overlay network (SSON). SMILAY works by deploying SMIBOXES over all the buildings of the microgrid and interconnecting them through an overlay network. A multicriteria selection mechanism is used to design a small set of SMIBOXES in charge of the information flow management. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach provides fast convergence time performance of the information flow compared to other related approaches using minimum network capacity.",

   "abstract": "Federated services are commonplace. Federated monitoring suffers from the classic development lag of being seen as a non-functional requirement. This has led to the development of monitoring federation techniques that focus on federation as a technical integration point rather than a dynamic business-to-business mediation function. This article presents a novel decentralized secure approach to creating and managing heterogeneous monitoring federations. This new approach relies on explicit management of the federal relationships rather than just the shared or exported services. Federal relationship management is achieved through the creation of trusted communication paths between federation members and the maintenance of semantic capability models for the shared monitoring services or resources. Monitoring capability heterogeneity and interoperability are addressed through the deployment of a managed semantic interoperability process between federated domains. Finally, a monitoring data annotation service, called semantic uplift, is used to ensure that sufficient context is provided with monitoring data to support its consumption by non-expert users in other domains. This novel approach gives the flexibility to deal with the dynamism and diversity of realistic multi-domain monitoring deployments.",

   "abstract": "Seamless roaming over wireless networks is highly desirable to mobile users, but ensuring the security and efficiency of this process is challenging. Although the same may be said for all communication systems, roaming services have special requirements and vulnerabilities, and therefore deserve special attention. Over the years, we have seen a variety of authentication protocols emerging to address this issue. However, which protocol is the most effective is still debatable. In this article, we first identify the challenges unique to roaming services as a set of mandatory and optional requirements. Next, we provide a brief state-of-the-art survey of existing work and point out their limitations in securing roaming services, especially in resistance against denial of service attacks, efficient authentication, flexible roaming in mobile contexts, as well as backward and forward non-linkabilities. To complement the security provided by the existing work, we then propose some mechanisms that can meet the aforementioned security and efficiency requirements. Finally, we present challenges that need to be addressed in roaming authentication.",

   "abstract": "Self-organizing network, or SON, technology, which is able to minimize human intervention in networking processes, was proposed to reduce the operational costs for service providers in future wireless systems. As a cost-effective means to significantly enhance capacity, heterogeneous deployment has been defined in the 3GPP LTEAdvanced standard, where performance gains can be achieved through increasing node density with low-power nodes, such as pico, femto, and relay nodes. The SON has great potential for application in future LTE-Advanced heterogeneous networks, also called HetNets. In this article, state-of-the-art research on self-configuring and self-optimizing HetNets are surveyed, and their corresponding SON architectures are introduced. In particular, we discuss the issues of automatic physical cell identifier assignment and radio resource configuration in HetNets based on selfconfiguring SONs. As for self-optimizing SONs, we address the issues of optimization strategies and algorithms for mobility management and energy saving in HetNets. At the end of the article, we show a testbed designed for evaluating SON technology, with which the performance gain of SON algorithms is demonstrated.",

   "abstract": "The current smart grid is undergoing a drastic change in order to deal with increasingly diversified and various service requests from the huge number of users. The next-generation smart grid, characterized by service-oriented middleware, will be upgraded by jointly employing the technologies in the areas of communications, control, and computing. To design a general middleware, an efficient design principle plays a fundamental role, while reliable communication infrastructure and heterogeneous applications lead to sustainability and stability. In this article, we propose an integrated and efficient middleware for heterogeneous services in a smart grid. Specifically, we first develop a mutual application access control principle that keeps users obtaining a satisfying assignment. Next, a collaborative and dynamic information exchange infrastructure is proposed for different smart meters, and a local information collector is designed to implement the communication and computing through power management messages. Finally, we present four steps to design a flexible service-oriented middleware for heterogeneous applications. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed middleware.",

Here, we first discuss some drawbacks of current technologies, and then show that silicon photonics will solve those interconnection problems. Next, we describe our studies toward realizing a system integration platform based on photonics and electronics convergence, and show that an optical interposer is the most efficient way to cope with the various problems that a purely electronic system may encounter. Our recent advances in silicon photonic devices are also described, and their integration into the hybrid interposer is reported through an early prototyping result. Finally, a surface mounted components approach for silicon photonics technology is discussed, which may prove useful in the computer and communication markets.",

   "abstract": "It is believed that vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and accurate positioning with sub-meter error could bring vehicle safety to a different level. However, to this date it is still unclear whether the envisioned V2V standard, dedicated short-range communications, can become available in commercially available vehicle products, while widely available consumergrade GPS receivers do not provide the required accuracy for many safety applications. In this article, combining visible light communications and visible light positioning, we propose the use of smart automotive lighting in vehicle safety systems. These lights would be able to provide the functions of illumination and signaling, reliable communications, and accurate positioning in a single solution. The proposed solution has low complexity, and is shown to be scalable in high vehicle density and fast topology changing scenarios. In this article, we also present several design guidelines for such a system, based on the results of our analytic and empirical studies. Finally, evaluation of our prototype provides evidence that the system can indeed detect potential risks in advance and provide early warnings to the driver in real-world scenarios, lowering the probability of traffic accidents.",

   "abstract": "Smart grid forensic science is a newly flourishing research area that is tightly coupled with cyber and physical security of the smart grid. Post-mortem analysis of a power system after a cyber attack or natural disaster generally provides the most accurate comprehension of the real-world vulnerabilities of the system and helps to protect the grid against similar attacks in the future as well as avoid failures during disasters. Besides increasing the security level of the smart grid, smart grid forensics aids evidence collection for the service of criminal justice. For instance, data extracted from smart meters and data collectors can provide evidence to legal proceedings in electricity theft matters. Furthermore, authentication and timestamping audio recordings using power grid frequency have been employed in several recent academic studies, as well as by the Metropolitan Police Forensic Audio Laboratory in London. Briefly, smart grid forensic science is emerging as a powerful security component of the power system. On the other hand, storage and processing of the enormous amount of data introduce significant challenges together with the privacy issue. In this article, we introduce the emerging application areas of smart grid forensic science, discuss the challenges, and outline the open issues in the topic. This article aims to serve as a roadmap for future smart grid forensic studies.",

This article introduces key concepts and frameworks of SUN as telecommunication infrastructures for emerging smart and ubiquitous environments in terms of capabilities and architectures. As a challenge for SUN development, we identify context awareness as a key capability for providing \"smartness,\" and propose methodologies and operational processes to support context-aware networking including a functional model. Finally, we illustrate a use case of SUN considering a smart city, and discuss future work and open issues for SUN standardization in ITU-T.",

With the growing popularity of social networks and video services, users are becoming the editors and broadcasters of their own stories. User-generated video content, which provides unique perspectives from individuals, is likely to be the new medium to complement professional broadcast TV for story sharing, especially in user communities of specific interest. We have developed Storisphere to provide a web-based collaborative video content workspace for members of a community to compose and share video stories, using desktop or mobile devices. Storisphere is currently being evaluated for video storytelling by various user communities.",

   "abstract": "The Tactical Ground Reporting System (TIGR) is a cloud-based application that facilitates collaboration and information sharing at the patrol level. DARPA began development efforts in 2005, and introduced the system to a single brigade in Iraq at the beginning of 2007. Its use spread to all Army units in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Kuwait, the Philippines, South Korea, and the Horn of Africa, and it has proven to be an indispensable tool for counterinsurgency operations. The system enables collection and dissemination of fine-grained information on people, places, and events, and offers a media-rich view of the battlefield with digital photos, videos, and high-resolution geospatial imagery. In 2011 TIGR transitioned to the Army and is now managed by the Project Manager for the Joint Battle Command-Platform (PM JBC-P), where it has expanded to include vehicle-based systems and other on-themove operational scenarios. Despite the richness of its multimedia content, TIGR has successfully operated for years in multiple theaters of war with minimal impact on low-bandwidth tactical networks. This article describes the TIGR system and how it has evolved, as well as the challenges of designing and deploying a distributed system for disadvantaged networks, and the unique data dissemination architecture that has made TIGR such a success.",

These needs are centered around seven dimensions: scalability in computing, storage, and bandwidth, scalability in network services, efficiency in resource utilization, agility in service creation, cost efficiency, service reliability, and security. This article focuses on the first five dimensions as they pertain to networking. Large data centers are targeting support for tens of thousands of servers, exabytes of storage, terabits per second of traffic, and tens of thousands of tenants. In a data center, server and storage resources are interconnected with packet switches and routers that provide for the bandwidth and multi-tenant virtual networking needs. Data centers are interconnected across the wide area network via routing and transport technologies to provide a pool of resources, known as the cloud. High-speed optical interfaces and dense wavelength-division multiplexing optical transport are used to provide for high-capacity transport intra- and inter-datacenter. This article reviews various switching, routing, and optical transport technologies, and their applicability in addressing the networking needs of large-scale multi-tenant data centers.",

   "abstract": "This article gives a tutorial about some critical milestones regarding the journey of tactical radios from legacy systems to cognitive radios. Although tactical radios have been in use for over 100 years, this tutorial focuses on the post- Vietnam War radios and uses examples from the U.S. Department of Defense major acquisition programs. The article considers legacy radios to be the generation of radios that was initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s that had spread-spectrum and frequency-hopping capabilities to resist jamming. The Link-16 system is covered in this article as a benchmark for legacy radios. Two major technological leaps came after these legacy radios. First was the software defined radios initiative, which brought about the ability to develop waveforms entirely in software in the absence of a defined hardware platform. As a result, different waveforms can be ported into the same hardware platform. This article presents the Wideband Networking Waveform, which is a complex waveform developed under a U.S. Department of Defense program, as a software-based waveform that can be downloaded into different hardware platforms. The next technological leap came with cognitive radios, which have the ability to sense their environments and adapt intelligently to the dynamics of the war theatre.",

   "abstract": "Mega data centers and their interconnection networks have drawn great attention in recent years because of the rapid public adoption of cloud-based services. The unprecedented amount of data that needs to be communicated between data centers imposes new requirements and challenges to inter-data-center optical networks. In this article, we discuss the traffic growth trends and capacity demands of Google\u00bfs inter-data-center network, and how they drive the network architectures and technologies to scale capacities and operational ease on existing fiber plants. We extensively review recent research findings and emerging technologies, such as digital coherent detection and the flexgrid dense wavelength-division multiplexed channel plan, and propose practical implementations, such as C+L-band transmission, packet and optical layer integration, and a software-defined networking enabled network architecture for both capacity and operational scaling. In addition, we point out a few critical areas that require more attention and research to improve efficiency and flexibility of an inter-data-center optical network: optical regeneration, data rate mismatch between Ethernet and optical transport, and real-time optical performance monitoring.",

   "abstract": "Cities are growing steadily, and the process of urbanization is a common trend in the world. Although cities are getting bigger, they are not necessarily getting better. With the aim to provide citizens with a better place to live, a new concept of a city was born: the smart city. The real meaning of smart city is not strictly defined, but it has gained much attention, and many cities are taking action in order to be considered 'smart'. These smart cities, founded on the use of information and communication technologies, aim at tackling many local problems, from local economy and transportation to quality of life and e-governance. Although technology helps to solve many of these local problems, their ability to gather unprecedented amounts of information could endanger the privacy of citizens. In this article we identify a number of privacy breaches that can appear within the context of smart cities and their services. We leverage some concepts of previously defined privacy models and define the concept of citizens' privacy as a model with five dimensions: identity privacy, query privacy, location privacy, footprint privacy and owner privacy. By means of several examples of smart city services, we define each privacy dimension and show how existing privacy enhancing technologies could be used to preserve citizens' privacy.",

A number of usage models are identified for such ultra-high data rates, including wireless communication within electronic equipment enabling possibilities such as wireless reconfigurable chip-to-chip communication. The 300 GHz band spanning about 55 GHz of contiguous bandwidth is identified as the most suitable candidate to accommodate these bandwidth- demanding applications. Furthermore, the main bottleneck issues are discussed: power consumption and antenna integration. With the help of basic link budget considerations, we indicate the technical feasibility of the proposed concept with compact low-cost antenna solutions. Finally, we discuss the overall system architecture to be standardized and indicate a number of key research topics.",

   "abstract": "Advanced communication/networking technologies should be integrated in next-generation power systems (a.k.a. smart grids) to improve their resilience, efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability. Many believe that the smart grid communication infrastructure will emerge from the interconnection of a large number of small-scale networks organized into a hierarchical architecture covering larger geographic areas. In this article, first we carry out a thorough analysis of the key components of the smart grid communication architecture, discussing the different network topologies and communication technologies that could be employed. Special emphasis is given to the advanced metering infrastructure, which will be used to interconnect the smart meters deployed at customers' premises with data aggregators and control centers. The design of scalable, reliable, and efficient networking solutions for AMI systems is an important research problem because these networks are composed of thousands of resource-constrained embedded devices usually interconnected with communication technologies that can provide only low-bandwidth and unreliable links. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks was recently standardized by the IETF to specifically meet the requirements of typical AMI applications. In this article we present a thorough overview of the protocol, and we critically analyze its advantages and potential limits in AMI applications. We also conduct a performance evaluation of RPL using a Contiki-based prototype of the RPL standard and a network emulator. Our results indicate that although average performance may appear reasonable for AMI networks, a few RPL nodes may suffer from severe unreliability issues and experience high packet loss rates due to the selection of suboptimal paths with highly unreliable links.",

Often data access patterns reveal too much and must be protected. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) eliminates this problem, but the performance of existing constructions is still unsatisfactory for clients with limited bandwidth and storage capabilities. This article discusses this problem overviewing the concept of ORAM and proposing novel optimizations to reduce the volume of data to be transferred per data access. These optimizations are the key to make ORAM more usable for personal storage, as confirmed by our experiments.",

   "abstract": "Operator controlled IP traffic offloading in cellular networks has been a lively topic in both product and standard development during recent years. Specifically, 3GPP has developed multiple IP traffic offloading solutions for their system architecture, typically requiring 3GPP-specific modifications for user equipment. We argue that an adequate lightweight access technology agnostic IP traffic offloading system is achievable with a generic internet layer solution. Such a solution can still utilize 3GPP system properties for operators to push offloading policies securely into mobile devices. We discuss existing 3GPP-specified offloading solutions and present three variations of our internet layer traffic offloading implementations, and compare them against 3GPP-specified solutions. Our hands-on experience in operator networks shows that such a direction is feasible and promising.",

   "abstract": "Social interaction is one of the basic components of human life that impacts thoughts, emotions, decisions, and the overall wellbeing of individuals. In this regard, monitoring social activity constitutes an important factor in a number of disciplines, particularly those related to social and health sciences. Sensor-based social interaction data collection has been seen as a groundbreaking tool, having the potential to overcome the drawbacks of traditional self-reporting methods and revolutionize social behavior analysis. However, monitoring of social interactions typically implies a trade-off between the quality of collected data and the levels of unobtrusiveness and privacy respect, aspects that can affect spontaneity in subjects' behavior. In this article we discuss the challenges of automatic monitoring of social interactions; then we provide an overview of the current automatic monitoring concepts and the associated trade-offs. We finally present our approach of using non-visual and non-auditory mobile sources that mitigate privacy concerns and do not interfere with individuals daily routines, while providing a reliable platform for social interaction data collection.",

   "abstract": "Firewalls are important network security devices that protect networks by blocking unwanted traffic based on filtering policies. However, the structure of firewall policies has a major impact on firewall security and performance. In this article, we classify, describe, and compare traffic-aware firewall policy management techniques based on their objectives, schemes, complexity, applicability, and limitations. We classify traffic-aware firewall policy techniques into two categories based on their goals: matching optimization and early rejection optimization schemes. Matching optimization techniques try to minimize the matching time of normal network traffic. Early rejection techniques create a minimum set of policy preamble rules (constraints) that can potentially filter out the maximum amount of denied traffic. Both categories are self-adaptive to ensure that the performance gain will always supersede the dynamic management maintenance overhead. We believe that our work provides important insights on the operation and use of trafficaware filtering.",

   "abstract": "Cellular network operators are striving to solve the problem caused by the increasing volume of traffic over their networks. Given the proliferation of multi-interface devices, offloading part of the traffic to available access networks (e.g., WiFi or 3G access networks, even from other operators) seems to be a promising alternative. Here, we propose an IMS-compatible solution for flow mobility between access networks that exhibits two key features: flow mobility is transparent to both local applications at mobile nodes and their communication peers (e.g., multimedia content servers), and mobility operations are assisted by the network, so the home network supports the terminal in the process of access network discovery, and provides the terminal with policies that meet visited and home operators\u00bf roaming agreements while optimizing the use of their networks. The proposed solution has been validated using a real IMS testbed with Ethernet and WiFi access networks, where the mobility of UDP and TCP flows has been tested.",

   "abstract": "Seismic exploration and monitoring for oil and gas reservoirs is a peculiar application that requires a large number (1000-2000 nodes/sqkm) of geophone sensors deployed outdoors over large areas (\u2265 40 sqkm) to measure backscattered wave fields from artificial sources. A storage/processing unit or sink node collects the measurements from all the geophones to obtain an image of the sub-surface. The existing cabling system to connect sensors is known to cause inefficiencies, large logistic and weight costs, as well as insufficient flexibility in survey design. Oil companies are therefore expecting that wireless connectivity will provide the enabling technology for future seismic explorations. This application represents a new challenging research area for the wireless community. Early results suggest that current off-the-shelf radio solutions do not guarantee the minimum requirements in terms of system usability and energy consumption, not even for current deployment size. This article presents a tutorial view to introduce the basic principles of seismic acquisition systems that are necessary to define the wireless geophone network specifications. Strict sampling synchronization constraint over large geographic areas, high precision sensor localization, and high data rate are all requirements calling for a scalable network system where Ultra-Wide Band radio transmissions play a key role as the only viable technology.",

   "abstract": "Cognitive radio is a promising technique to resolve the growing scarcity of the indispensable spectrum resources in wireless applications. Among its three major implementation paradigms, namely, interweave, overlay and underlay, underlay CR is the most flexible. However, the transmit power of secondary users (SUs) having to be strictly limited by the prescribed tolerable interference power dictated by primary users (PUs), confines underlay CR to short-range communications. To address this limitation, cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying techniques can be exploited to extend the coverage area and reduce the interference region of secondary transmission with low implementation complexity. Nevertheless, despite the significant potential of cooperation in underlay CR systems, advances in this context have been limited so far, mainly due to the extreme difficulty of mathematical tractability involved in the performance evaluation and design of these systems. This article aims to overview recent advances in this area. In particular, important dominating factors on system performance of underlay cooperative AF relaying in cellular networks are identified, in terms of cochannel interference coming from concurrent primary transmission, relay selection, number of relaying hops, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we outline some future research topics in this exciting area.",

People access OSNs using both traditional desktop PCs and new emerging mobile devices. With more than one billion users worldwide, OSNs are a new venue of innovation with many challenging research problems. In this survey, we aim to give a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research related to user behavior in OSNs from several perspectives. First, we discuss social connectivity and interaction among users. Also, we investigate traffic activity from a network perspective. Moreover, as mobile devices become a commodity, we pay attention to the characteristics of social behaviors in mobile environments. Last but not least, we review malicious behaviors of OSN users, and discuss several solutions to detect misbehaving users. Our survey serves the important roles of both providing a systematic exploration of existing research highlights and triggering various potentially significant research in these topics.",

Newer technologies such as Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are available as choices to a carrier that is upgrading PB networks. In this paper we focus on technologies that are be ing deployed in Metro Ethernet Networks and discuss how to introduce them in a gradual way. We also define a method that allows in-service migration of VLAN services. Furthermore, we provide techniques that allow providers to reap the benefits that the new technologies offer from the beginning of their deployment without the need for a forklift network upgrade.",

   "abstract": "We discuss the near future impact that recent developments of quantum technologies can have in the field of fiber optic communication systems. The ability to generate, manipulate, transmit, and detect a single or very few photon(s) may open new routes that can trigger a completely new generation of communication systems. We show that quantum technologies can address two of the more challenging problems communication engineers face nowadays: capacity and security. Indeed, by radically decreasing the number of photons used to encode each bit of information, we can more efficiently explore the full capacity to carry information of optical fibers. Moreover, by encoding information in individual or very few photons, we can take advantage of the quantum laws to add new functionalities to communication systems. Secrecy is the more obvious one, but a completely new set of functionalities can be added at the physical layer considering the peculiarities of quantum laws that rule transmission and detection.",

   "abstract": "Service providers are facing a two-dimensional challenge in deploying broadband access networks: the evolution of service demand and competition. The demand for content-rich services including high-definition multicast and unicast video is increasing. Also, telephone companies are facing fierce competition from cable companies, especially in the North American market. In areas where fiber to the home is not cost effective, vectored DSL is a cost-effective solution for achieving downstream data rates of 100 Mb/s over 500 m by leveraging the existing copper infrastructure. This article outlines the key market driving forces behind the need for high-speed DSL and specifically vectored DSL. This article also describes many vectoring features and capabilities, and highlights the key considerations for service providers in terms of vectored DSL planning, operation, and management.",

   "abstract": "This article proposes a next generation ubiquitous converged infrastructure to support cloud and mobile cloud computing services. The proposed infrastructure facilitates interconnection of fixed and mobile end users with data centers through a heterogeneous network integrating optical metro networks, based on time shared optical network technology, and wireless access networks, based on Long Term Evolution access technology. To support the infrastructure as a service paradigm, the proposed architecture adopts the concept of virtualization across the technology domains involved. Planning of virtual infrastructures considering jointly the presence of all network technology domains and IT resources is proposed, with the aim to offer globally optimized virtual infrastructures (VIs) in terms of energy consumption and resource requirements. The holistic VI planning approach proposed ensures allocation of the required resources across all technology domains to support not only the volume of service requests, but also their specific characteristics such as end users' mobility. Our modeling results clearly show that both the volume and characteristics of services have a direct impact on the energy consumption and resource requirements of all the technology domains of the planned VIs.",

Recent developments in organic LEDs have enabled high efficiency and brightness devices that can be used for data transmission as in conventional VLC systems. VLC utilizes the visible wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum (370-780 nm). Here we demonstrate an organic VLC link using an OLED with 93 kHz bandwidth as the source and a silicon photodetector with 5 MHz bandwidth and a 10 dB gain as the receiver. A wide range of modulation schemes are examined; and, as is commonplace in communications systems, equalization techniques are implemented to maximize data rates into the megabits per second region, and 2.7 Mb/s was achieved.",

   "abstract": "The widespread introduction of white LEDs for illumination provides a unique opportunity to create an indoor positioning system that is flexible, accurate, and ubiquitous. Signals transmitted by the LEDs are used to determine the position of a person or object within a room. To take full advantage of this new opportunity, it is essential that comprehensive and robust international standards are developed before a plethora of incompatible proprietary systems flood the market. In this article, we discuss the very diverse range of potential applications of these future systems and their implications for the design of a new standard. Another consideration is that the transmission of positioning signals must not compromise the primary function of the LEDs, which is energy-efficient illumination, so visible flicker must be avoided. Position information can be derived from a range of properties of the received signal, such as the power of the received signal or the angle at which the signal reaches the receiver. The suitability of different techniques for an indoor positioning system is considered. Finally, we discuss the implications each of these aspects has for the design of an effective standard.",

   "abstract": "A wide-area measurement system (WAMS) is a system that provides a time-synchronized view of electrical conditions over a large geographical area, thereby enhancing the situational awareness of the energy management system of a power grid. With this enhanced situational awareness, utilities would be able to react promptly to contingencies, and prevent large-scale blackouts. To secure WAMS communications, we propose WAMS key management (WAKE), a comprehensive key management scheme targeting a concrete set of security objectives derived from NIST's security impact level ratings. For security objectives involving unicast, WAKE employs industry- standard security protocols. For security objectives involving multicast, we show the scheme standardized by the IEC is inadequate, and identify multicast authentication as a requirement. We investigate two recent multicast authentication schemes designed for power grid communications: TV-HORS and tunable signing and verification (TSV), which supposedly improves on TV-HORS. We show that TSV is vulnerable, and propose a patched version of TSV called TSV+. Systematic comparison of TV-HORS and TSV+ shows that TV-HORS provides significantly more efficient signing and verification for the same security level at the expense of signature size. Consequently, TV-HORS is chosen as part of WAKE for multicast authentication.",

   "abstract": "The deployment of small cell base stations, SCBSs, overlaid on existing macrocellular systems is seen as a key solution for offloading traffic, optimizing coverage, and boosting the capacity of future cellular wireless systems. The next generation of SCBSs is envisioned to be multimode (i.e., capable of transmitting simultaneously on both licensed and unlicensed bands). This constitutes a cost-effective integration of both WiFi and cellular radio access technologies that can efficiently cope with peak wireless data traffic and heterogeneous quality of service requirements. To leverage the advantage of such multimode SCBSs, we discuss the novel proposed paradigm of cross-system learning by means of which SCBSs self-organize and autonomously steer their traffic flows across different RATs. Cross-system learning allows the SCBSs to leverage the advantage of both the WiFi and cellular worlds. For example, the SCBSs can offload delay-tolerant data traffic to WiFi, while simultaneously learning the probability distribution function of their transmission strategy over the licensed cellular band. This article first introduces the basic building blocks of cross-system learning and then provides preliminary performance evaluation in a Long-Term Evolution simulator overlaid with WiFi hotspots. Remarkably, it is shown that the proposed cross-system learning approach significantly outperforms a number of benchmark traffic steering policies.",

   "abstract": "Interference control is crucial to reach the expected spectral efficiencies in femtocell systems. Centralized and joint baseband (BB) processing of all femtocell signals can reduce inter-cell/intra-cell interference at the expense of fast signaling and strict synchronization to coordinate the multiple femtocell links. In this article, we revisit the conventional femtocell architecture by proposing the multi-cell baseband processing for interference mitigation based on a distributed antennas system. The proposed configuration resorts to the wireless over cable (WoC) paradigm and is based on the concept of replacing the in-house base station (Femtocell Access Point) with a home-device that simply transfers the analog radio frequency (RF) signals from the air-link to the existing cable connections. These home-devices act as bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relays of air signals toward cable (and vice-versa) by operating a frequency conversion of the wireless spectrum to accommodate the cable specifications and coexistence with other services. Splitting RF processing (at home) from baseband processing (centralized at the nearest street cabinet or central office collecting multiple cables) guarantees that multi-cell processing exploits the same advantages as MIMO systems. The analysis of WoC for twisted pair telephone lines shows the advantages of the FemtoWoC architecture despite the coexistence with other interfering xDSL services over the cable, or the propagation over the widely deployed copper wirelines.",
