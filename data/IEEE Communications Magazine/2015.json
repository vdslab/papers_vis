      "abstract": "Heterogeneous and small cell networks (Het- SNets) increase spectral efficiency and throughput via hierarchical deployments. In order to meet the increasing requirements in capacity for future 5G wireless networks, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications with unprecedented spectral resources have been suggested for 5G HetSNets. While the mmWave physical layer is well understood, major challenges remain for its effective and efficient implementation in Het- SNets from an access and networking point of view. Toward this end, we introduce a novel but 3GPP backwards-compatible frame structure, based on time-division duplex, which facilitates both high-capacity access and backhaul links. We then discuss networking issues arising from the multihop nature of the mmWave backhauling mesh. Finally, system-level simulations evaluate the performance of HetSNets with mmWave communications and corroborate the possibility of having capacities of tens of gigabits per second in emerging 5G systems.",

      "abstract": "Multi-antenna techniques capable of exploiting the elevation dimension are anticipated to be an important air-interface enhancement targeted to handle the expected growth in mobile traffic. In order to enable the development and evaluation of such multi-antenna techniques, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recently developed a three-dimensional (3D) channel model. The existing two-dimensional (2D) channel models do not capture the elevation channel characteristics, making them insufficient for such studies. This article describes the main components of the newly developed 3D channel model and the motivations behind introducing them. One key factor is the ability to model channels for users located on different floors of a building (at different heights). This is achieved by capturing a user height dependency in modelling some channel characteristics including pathloss, lineof- sight (LOS) probability, etc. In general, this 3D channel model follows the framework of WINNERII/WINNER+ while also extending the applicability and the accuracy of the model by introducing some height dependent and distance dependent elevation related parameters.",

      "abstract": "Conventional elastic optical networking, EON, uses elasticity in two domains, time and frequency, to optimize utilization of optical network resources in the presence of fluctuating traffic demand and link quality. Currently, networking exploiting a third domain, space, is the focus of significant research efforts since space-division multiplexing, SDM, has the potential to substantially improve future network capacity and spectral efficiency. This article extends 2D-EON to include elasticity in all three domains: time, frequency, and space. We introduce enabling technologies, architectures, and algorithms for 3D-EONs. Based on sample network topologies, we investigate algorithms for routing, spectrum, spatial mode, and modulation format assignment - RSSMA. In particular, we investigate fragmentation-aware RSSMA and how the constraints in the formation of super-channels in MIMO-based SDM systems can impact the network performance in terms of blocking probability.",

New 5G characteristics put forward a lot of requirements for spectrum in terms of total amount, candidate bands, as well as new challenges for spectrum usage methods and management. Based on China's current situation, this article first discusses the 5G vision, spectrum demands, and potential candidate bands. Furthermore, it is indicated that spectrum sharing will bring many benefits for 5G systems, and different sharing scenarios are summarized. Finally, based on the current framework of spectrum management in China, potential services classification and spectrum assessment are proposed to accommodate new 5G requirements.",

In this article, we review the history of WLAN standards, and provide technical overviews of the recent development of WLAN systems. Especially, as the original inventor and the proposer, we focus on beamforming and compressed feedback schemes, which have been adopted in 802.11 WLAN standards, to improve the throughput for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. These techniques are essential to maximize the downlink system throughput for multiple user transmission as well as for single user transmission. Also, we present discussions on new technologies to further enhance user throughput, which are currently considered for future WLAN systems.",

      "abstract": "Messaging service still remains fundamental for military operations. This service is an important tool to fulfill missions, either in time of peace or in time of crisis. Military operational needs must comply with specific requirements. Military standards describe the services that meet these needs. For different reasons, current military messaging standards have become obsolete, thus demanding the definition of new military standards. The main requirements concerning such systems have been put together. The main document, \"Future Military Messaging,\" issued in 2005, identifies the different usages of a future military messaging system with the associated requirements in each case. Even if this document has become the reference model in the military messaging area, new theoretical developments are required. Indeed, it quickly appears that the development of a messaging system compliant only with this model could lead to rigid implementation, preventing any evolution of the system. This article reformulates the messaging system through a new concept called correspondence applied to military messaging. The main interest of this model is to decorrelate the deployment of the policies from the implementation of the messaging handling system. Therefore, it offers new prospects for military messaging systems with the ability of providing different levels of services dedicated to various military environments.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we investigate self-organizing optimization for cognitive small cells (CSCs), which have the ability to sense the environment, learn from historical information, make intelligent decisions, and adjust their operational parameters. By exploring the inherent features, some fundamental challenges for self-organizing optimization in CSCs are presented and discussed. Specifically, the dense and random deployment of CSCs brings about some new challenges in terms of scalability and adaptation; furthermore, the uncertain, dynamic, and incomplete information constraints also impose some new challenges in terms of convergence and robustness. For providing better service to users and improving resource utilization, four requirements for self-organizing optimization in CSCs are presented and discussed. Following the attractive fact that the decisions in game-theoretic models are exactly coincident with those in self-organizing optimization (i.e., distributed and autonomous), we establish a framework of gametheoretic solutions for self-organizing optimization in CSCs and propose some featured game models. Specifically, their basic models are presented, some examples are discussed, and future research directions are given.",

      "abstract": "In the near future, wireless communication systems are expected to achieve more cost-efficient and sustainable operations by replacing conventional fixed power supplies such as batteries with energy harvesting devices, which could provide electric energy from renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind). Such EH power supplies, however, are random and unstable in nature, and as a result impose new challenges on reliable communication design and have triggered substantial research interest in EH-based wireless communications. Building on existing works, in this article, we develop a general optimization framework to maximize the utility of EH wireless communication systems. Our framework encapsulates a variety of design problems, such as throughput maximization and outage probability minimization in single-user and multiuser setups, and provides useful guidelines to the practical design of general EH-based communication systems with different assumptions regarding the knowledge of time-varying wireless channels and EH rates at the transmitters.",

However, the energy resources are still insufficient while the harvesting module is added on the node. To prolong the network lifetime and meet the demand of a green wireless network, a dynamic gradient-aware hierarchical packet forwarding mechanism is designed. According to the relative positions of nodes, gradient-aware clusters are established. Consequently, considering the energy conversion efficiency and relative distance, cluster heads are selected reasonably. Furthermore, by exploiting the available energy and the number of cluster members, packets can be forwarded to the sink in an energy-efficient manner. Results show that the network lifetime can be noticeably improved.",

      "abstract": "In the last five years, the availability of powerful DSP and communications design software, and the emergence of relatively affordable devices that receive and digitize RF signals, has brought SDR to the desktops of many communications engineers. However, the more recent availability of very low cost SDR devices such as the RTL-SDR, costing less than $20, has brought SDR to the home desktops of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professional engineers and the maker communities. Since the release of the various open source drivers for the RTL-SDR, many in the digital communications community have used this device to scan the RF spectrum and digitize I/Q signals that are being transmitted in the range 25 MHz to 1.75 GHz. This wide operating range enables the sampling of frequency bands containing signals such as FM radio, ISM signals, GSM, 3G and LTE mobile radio, GPS, and so on. In this article we will describe the opportunity and operation of the RTL-SDR, and the development of a handson, open-courseware for SDR. These educational materials can be integrated into core curriculum undergraduate and graduate courses, and will greatly enhance the teaching of DSP and communications theory, principles, and applications. The lab and teaching materials have recently been used in senior (fourth year undergraduate) courses and are available as open course materials for all to access, use, and evolve.",

      "abstract": "Rate adaptation technologies aim at establishing a linear relationship between power consumption and traffic load in packet networks. They rely on power profiles of network elements, which map system configurations and traffic loads onto power consumption levels, for the selection of network resources to place into low-power states and to identify new system designs with high power-saving yields. We introduce a methodology for profiling the power consumption of network systems that reconciles modeling accuracy with cost containment and rapidity in the preparation and execution of power measurements. We apply the methodology to network systems from multiple vendors and find it capable of delivering a clear message: the power savings enabled by protocol and system software upgrades that support demand-timescale rate adaptation are worthwhile, but also largely inferior to those attainable with a new generation of hardware platforms that pervasively deploy packet-timescale rate adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Current telecom networks generate massive amounts of monitoring data consisting of observations on network faults, configuration, accounting, performance, and security. Due to the ever increasing degree of complexity of networks, coupled with specific constraints (legal, regulatory, increasing scale of management in heterogeneous networks), the traditional reactive management approaches are increasingly stretched beyond their capabilities. A new network management paradigm is required that takes a preemptive rather than reactive approach to network management. This work presents the design and specification of E-Stream, a predictive recommendationbased solution to automated network management. The architecture of E-Stream illustrates the challenges of leveraging vast volumes of management data to identify preemptive corrective actions. Such design challenges are mitigated by the components of E-Stream, which together form a single functional system. The EStream approach starts by abstracting trace information to extract sequences of events relevant to interesting incidents in the network. After observing event sequences in incoming event streams, specific appropriate actions are selected, ranked, and recommended to preempt the predicted incidents.",

      "abstract": "The Internet infrastructure is gradually improving its flexibility and adaptability due to the incorporation of new promising technologies, such as the software-defined networks and the network function virtualization. The main goal is to meet the diverse communication needs of the users, while the global system operation satisfies the business and societal goals of the infrastructure and service providers. This calls for solutions that consider both local and global network viewpoints and provide sophisticated system control in a stable and predictable way, while being service-aware. We propose a fully integrated solution along these lines: the VLSP, a service-aware software-defined infrastructure for networks and clouds. The VLSP consists of three main distributed systems: a facility performing uniformly logically-centralized management and control of the infrastructure, called the virtual infrastructure management; an information management infrastructure able to maintain an accurate view of the infrastructure environment at both the local and system levels, called the virtual infrastructure information service; and a lightweight virtualization hypervisor able to perform configuration changes in the infrastructure resources, called the lightweight network hypervisor. We discuss representative use-case scenarios, while we demonstrate how VLSP tunes performance trade-offs for particular service demands.",

      "abstract": "Many telecom operators are deploying their own cloud infrastructure with the two-fold objective of providing cloud services to their customers and enabling network function virtualization. In this article we present an architecture we call SHINE, which focuses on orchestrating cloud with heterogeneous access and core networks. In this architecture intra and inter DC connectivity is dynamically controlled, maximizing the overall performance in terms of throughput and latency while minimizing total costs. The main building blocks are: a future-proof network architecture that can scale to offer potentially unlimited bandwidth based on an active remote node (ARN) to interface end-users and the core network; an innovative distributed DC architecture consisting of micro-DCs placed in selected core locations to accelerate content delivery, reducing core network traffic, and ensuring very low latency; and dynamic orchestration of the distributed DC and access and core network segments. SHINE will provide unprecedented quality of experience, greatly reducing costs by coordinating network and cloud and facilitating service chaining by virtualizing network functions.",

      "abstract": "As people pay more attention to environmental protection and energy conservation issues, energy consumption in communications have become a hot research field. In wireless communications networks such as wireless sensor networks, traditional battery-operated devices or nodes have a short lifetime and die after the batteries are depleted, and replacing the batteries may be very costly and sometimes will be impossible. Therefore, energy harvesting (EH) communications have become a good means to solve this problem. EH communications mean the nodes can continue working by harvesting ambient energy. EH communications are different from the traditional battery-operated communications, so we need new models and optimal transmission policies to maximize the throughput. In this article we review different methods of harvesting the ambient energy in EH communications and the models of EH communications. We focus on offline optimal policies, then compare different policies and classify them into certain types. Finally, we propose several open research challenges and directions for future work.",

In this article we survey the latest development in energy-efficient scheduling, a.k.a. green scheduling, for both classic and heterogeneous cellular networks. We first introduce the main system model and framework that are considered in most of the existing green scheduling works. We then describe the main contributions on green scheduling as well as summarize their key findings. For instance, green scheduling schemes have demonstrated that they can significantly reduce transmit power and improve the energy efficiency of cellular systems. We also provide a performance analysis of some of the existing schemes in order to highlight some of the challenges that need to be addressed to make green scheduling more effective in heterogeneous networks. Indeed, the coordination between tiers and the rate fairness between the users of different tiers are important issues that have not yet been addressed. In addition, most existing designs exhibit a computational complexity that is too high for being deployed in a real system.",

      "abstract": "Radio communications is one of the most disruptive technologies in railways, enabling a huge set of value-added services that greatly improve many aspects of railways, making them more efficient, safer, and profitable. Lately, some major technologies like ERTMS for high-speed railways and CBTC for subways have made possible a reduction of headway and increased safety never before seen in this field. The railway industry is now looking at wireless communications with great interest, and this can be seen in many projects around the world. Thus, railway radio communications is again a flourishing field, with a lot of research and many things to be done. This survey article explains both opportunities and challenges to be addressed by the railway sector in order to obtain all the possible benefits of the latest radio technologies.",

      "abstract": "SDN is considered to be a promising way to re-architect the Internet. However, the Internet is managed by owners of different administrative domains, so the centralized control model of SDN must be extended to account for inter-domain traffic. Thus, this article proposes a WE-Bridge mechanism to enable different SDN administrative domains to peer and cooperate. Based on WE-Bridge, we further designed two innovative inter-domain routing applications as use cases. To verify our design, we implemented the WE-Bridge and the two use cases by building an international testbed on which WE-Bridge, together with the two use cases, are deployed. The testbed is composed of four SDN networks: CERNET, Internet 2 in USA, CSTNET, and SURFnet.",

      "abstract": "An important new feature in the DOCSIS 3.1 specification is active queue management (AQM). AQM provides a solution to the problem of providing good application layer quality of experience when multiple applications share a network connection. The need for AQM arises due to the presence of packet buffering in network elements and the mechanics of the TCP congestion avoidance algorithm. Based on simulated performance and implementation considerations, a variant of the Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE) algorithm, called DOCSIS-PIE, is now included in DOCSIS 3.1 and has recently been added to the DOCSIS 3.0 specification as well. Implementation of DOCSIS-PIE is mandatory for implementation in DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems, and recommended for implementation in DOCSIS 3.0 cable modems. In addition to the mandatory/ recommended algorithm, DOCSIS 3.1 and 3.0 cable modem vendors are free to support additional AQM algorithms of their choosing. For managing downstream traffic, the DOCSIS 3.1 specification mandates that the CMTS support an AQM technology, but does not require a specific algorithm. This article discusses the underlying problem that is addressed by AQM, the selection of DOCSIS-PIE as the algorithm of choice for DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems, and the expected performance of the algorithm in simulated network conditions.",

Although the elderly have wisdom and wealth gathered from their life experiences, they require special assistance, higher health insurance costs, and even constant monitoring. By utilizing information process and communications technology, ambient assisted living (AAL) communications open up a new way to address such needs for the aged and the sick. Specifically, AAL uses ambient technologies, including data sensing, processing, transmission, and artificial intelligence, to enable new products, services, and processes that help to provide safe, healthy lives for the aged and disabled. It also supports improved social connections and accessibility to the external world. With the growth of AAL environment, the accessibility gets more challenging for the complex data structure.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the explosively growing demands for mobile service bring both challenges and opportunities to wireless networks, giving birth to fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. The features and requirements of different services are diverse in 5G. The management and coordination among heterogeneous networks, applications, and user demands need the 5G network to be open and flexible to ensure that network resources are allocated with high efficiency. To fulfill these requirements, wireless network virtualization is used to integrate heterogeneous wireless networks and coordinate network resources. In this article we propose a model of wireless network virtualization consisting of three planes: the data plane, the cognitive plane, and the control plane. A novel control signaling scheme has also been designed to support the proposed model. From the implementation perspective of network virtualization, a hierarchical control scheme based on cell-clustering has been used with dynamically optimized efficiency of resource utilization. Two use cases have been analyzed to demonstrate how the schemes work under the proposed model to improve resource efficiency and the user experience.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the application of the recent European Licensed Shared Access (LSA) concept for spectrum sharing between a mobile network operator (MNO) and an incumbent user. LSA, as a new area of application of cognitive technology, provides the MNO an opportunity to access new frequency resources on a shared basis. The article presents critical design criteria of LSA from the MNO point of view in order to allow future cognitive cellular networks to efficiently exploit shared spectrum bands. We describe the role of LSA bands in the context of heterogeneous networking, and identify the Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced enabling technologies that support the introduction of LSA. Such technologies include traffic steering, carrier aggregation, and self-organizing networking. Additionally, we introduce an LSA management unit controlled by the MNO, to be implemented on top of the existing LTE/LTEAdvanced architecture, and we discuss the functionalities required for the optimization and automation of LSA resource management. We also depict the interrelations of the tasks between the LSA management unit and the supporting LTE/LTE-Advanced technologies. Based on the findings in this article, the ongoing cellular system evolution is shown to form a solid base for the introduction of new shared spectrum bands for cognitive cellular systems.",

      "abstract": "New architectural requirements appear with the evolution of mobile networks, such as the provisioning of multihoming or offloading. In general, this requires the design of ad hoc schemes on top of the EPS, which may be seen as an indicator of the need for a back-to-basics architectural analysis. This article analyzes the basic architectural principles of the EPS, and compares them with those of SDN and LISP. We then describe an evolutionary path for the EPS, by showing how, with slight modifications inspired by SDN and LISP, future mobile carrier networks could natively fulfill some of their flexibility and scalability requirements. The key design principles for that are: a generalized use of traffic flow templates (i.e., 5-tuple flows) for more flexible IP flow handling; a full decoupling of control and user plane for flexibility; and an on-demand (or pull-based) state setting at network nodes for scalability. Some examples are given to illustrate the thesis of this article.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the design of an experimental RF noise cancellation system to demonstrate the reduction of interference signals from LTE or other RF devices that overlap with the DOCSIS\u00ae or Cable TV spectrum. The main components of the demonstration system include a four-path RF reconstruction circuit board, SNR monitoring and control module, an adjustable Gradient Control Algorithm in software, and two DOCSIS 3.1 FPGA boards. The configuration for this demonstration system includes an antenna attached to the RF reconstruction circuit. The antenna is used to receive a reference of the interfering signal. The amplitude and phase of the reference signal is dynamically adjusted to cancel the undesirable component of the RF signal. The main experimental analysis is focused on a 20MHz wide LTE signal in 700MHz bands. The designed system is able to achieve an optimal noise cancellation result by adjusting the amplitude and phase of the reference signal to minimize the interference signal transmitted in the coax cable.",

      "abstract": "This article details a novel approach to the fine-tuning of carrier-grade virtualized network function deployments for both performance optimization and diagnostic purposes, using embedded instrumentation with an analytics framework. The work presented in this article is the output of a co-lab established between BT and Intel Labs Europe to investigate network-function-virtualization-related problems faced by traditional telecom operators. Results from comprehensive testing of virtual CDN and WAN acceleration use cases are presented. These results led to the development of a number of insights that will help network operators optimize the deployment of NFV on standard high volume servers. Significantly, it was found that the default configuration for some use cases resulted in suboptimal resource allocation and consumption. Consequently, opportunities exist for carriers to fine-tune their NFV deployments from both the technical and economic perspectives using approaches such as embedded instrumentation.",

      "abstract": "In fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, a major challenge is to effectively improve system capacity and meet dynamic service demands. One promising technology to solve this problem is heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which involve a large number of densified low power nodes (LPNs). This article proposes a software defined network (SDN) based intelligent model that can efficiently manage the heterogeneous infrastructure and resources. In particular, we first review the latest SDN standards and discuss the possible extensions. We then discuss the advantages of SDN in meeting the dynamic nature of services and requirements in 5G HetNets. Finally, we develop a variety of schemes to improve traffic control, subscriber management, and resource allocation. Performance analysis shows that our proposed system is reliable, scalable, and implementable.",

      "abstract": "We show how a disruptive force in mobile computing can be created by extending today's unmodified cloud to a second level consisting of self-managed data centers with no hard state called cloudlets. These are located at the edge of the Internet, just one wireless hop away from associated mobile devices. By leveraging lowlatency offload, cloudlets enable a new class of real-time cognitive assistive applications on wearable devices. By processing high data rate sensor inputs such as video close to the point of capture, cloudlets can reduce ingress bandwidth demand into the cloud. By serving as proxies for distant cloud services that are unavailable due to failures or cyberattacks, cloudlets can improve robustness and availability. We caution that proprietary software ecosytems surrounding cloudlets will lead to a fragmented marketplace that fails to realize the full business potential of mobile-cloud convergence. Instead, we urge that the software ecosystem surrounding cloudlets be based on the same principles of openness and end-to-end design that have made the Internet so successful.",

      "abstract": "SON technologies have been a promising approach for simplified and automated RAN management. Currently, SON functions can be D-SON among the network elements or C-SON as part of the OSS/NMS. D-SON technology is typically provided by equipment vendors, while C-SON is provided by both third parties and equipment vendors. D-SON has high reactivity but is usually provided as black boxes with poor or no interoperability between different vendors and management systems, hence rendering their integration a challenging task. On the other hand, OSS/NMS-level SONs, although provided with a global network view, are limited to coarse time operation. In this work we apply SDN principles to the management of RANs and propose a software-defined SON (SD-SON) framework that tackles the shortcomings and combines the benefits of both approaches above, namely, high reactivity along with flexibility, programmability, and openness. The architectural components, implementation aspects, and advantages of the proposed SD-SON framework are described in detail. A proof-of-concept prototype of a programmable self-managed LTE-Advanced heterogeneous network is also presented.",

As an alternative to conventional energy harvesting techniques, SWIPT relies on the use of radio frequency signals, and is expected to bring some fundamental changes to the design of wireless communication networks. This article focuses on the application of advanced smart antenna technologies to SWIPT, including multiple-input multiple-output and relaying techniques. These smart antenna technologies have the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency and also the spectral efficiency of SWIPT. Different network topologies with single and multiple users are investigated, along with some promising solutions to achieve a favorable trade-off between system performance and complexity. A detailed discussion of future research challenges for the design of SWIPT systems is also provided.",

      "abstract": "Continuous growth in the energy consumption of mobile networks has become a major concern for mobile carriers. Since current mobile networks are dominated by mobile data traffic generated by over-the-top mobile applications, it is crucial for mobile carriers to understand how much network energy is used to deliver these applications. Here, we use real network and application measurements to comprehensively analyze the energy consumption of 12 common mobile applications by breaking down their total energy consumption into data and signaling energy components. The results provide insights into the different proportions of data and signaling energy (due to LTE signaling) for different mobile applications. They show that the energy consumption of a mobile application can vary at different base station cell sites due to different ratios of throughput to physical resource block utilization. We estimate the total monthly energy consumption of all 4G users of a major mobile carrier using conventional mobile services, such as voice and the short messaging service, and two over-the-top applications, i.e. a popular instant messaging application in China and an online video application. The results show that signaling energy consumption may become a major concern for mobile carriers, and that this issue will be exacerbated as the usage of over-the-top applications continues to grow. Energy assessment of mobile applications provides valuable information to enable mobile carriers to improve the energy efficiency of their networks. An energy assessment tool that enables real-time network and service energy monitoring will also assist in developing energy-efficient network policies for diverse applications with different energy consumption profiles. Furthermore, given our signaling energy consumption findings for over-the-top applications, there may be benefits for mobile operators to introduce a surcharge for signaling traffic to mitigate the high signaling energy consumption of some over-the-top mobile applications.",

Obviously, due to this heterogeneity, it is very important to study the asynchronous flow scheduling problem. This article designs a simple but efficient asynchronous flow scheduling scheme aiming to sense, predict, and realize AAL applications. Specifically, the scheduling architecture is developed by analyzing various device characteristics and user activities, and the corresponding applications are classified from user needs aspects. Subsequently, we propose asynchronous flow scheduling taking into account energy efficiency and implementation simplicity.

      "abstract": "Recently, densified small cell deployment with overlay coverage through coexisting heterogeneous networks has emerged as a viable solution for 5G mobile networks. However, this multi-tier architecture along with stringent latency requirements in 5G brings new challenges in security provisioning due to the potential frequent handovers and authentications in 5G small cells and HetNets. In this article, we review related studies and introduce SDN into 5G as a platform to enable efficient authentication hand-over and privacy protection. Our objective is to simplify authentication handover by global management of 5G HetNets through sharing of userdependent security context information among related access points. We demonstrate that SDN-enabled security solutions are highly efficient through its centralized control capability, which is essential for delay-constrained 5G communications.",

As a result, we have been witnessing a significant growth in the number of elderly people around the world. Ensuring a comfortable living environment for elderly people has gained much attention in recent years. By leveraging information and communication technologies, the AAL system shows great promise in satisfying many requirements of elderly people and enables them to live safely, securely, healthily, and independently. Over the last few years various AAL systems, mostly based on Wireless Body Area Network technologies, have been proposed to improve the quality of life of elderly people. Since the information transmitted in AAL systems is very personal, the security and privacy of such data are becoming important issues that must be dealt with. We first discuss the overall system architecture of a typical AAL system and its associated security requirements. Next we propose an efficient authentication protocol for the AAL system and describe how it meets various security requirements. Finally we compare the performance of the proposed authentication protocol with two other recent authentication protocols and demonstrate its superior efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Due to technical advances in train control and wireless communications, unmanned train operation has gained in popularity of late. On the other hand, any errors involved in managing the QoS of train control traffic will cause negative consequences such as possible loss of life. Operators therefore naturally wish to scrutinize the specifications so that the wireless communications system is capable of guaranteeing the QoS of the train control traffic. In this article, we propose a feasible QoS management scheme for train control traffic based on the methodology used in a conventional LTE system. Based on the proposed scheme, we evaluate the feasibility of the LTE system using a testbed built in a commercial railway region. The key issues to support the train control services by the LTE system are the design of a QoS policy based on analyzing the characteristics of the train control traffic and the appropriate adjustment of the cell parameters during the cell planning and optimization procedures in order to resolve any network issues that may cause problems with data pause.",

To support this, the RANs are evolving in two important aspects. One aspect is \u201ccloudification,\u201d which is to pool baseband units to be centralized for statistical multiplexing gain. The other aspect is to use advanced optical technologies for digital and analog signal transmission in a cloud-based RAN. In this article, we focus on BBU cloud interconnection with optical layer technologies. Flexible grid optical networks with the enabling technologies are introduced to provide elastic, transparent, and virtualized optical paths between the BBU pools. To improve the elasticity and intelligence of C-RAN, we propose a software defined centralized control plane to coordinate heterogeneous resources from three domains: the BBU domain, radio domain, and optical domain. We report an experimental demonstration of elastic lightpath provision for cloud radio-over-flexible grid optical networks in a software-defined-networking-based testbed.",

      "abstract": "With the evolution of the Internet and related technologies, there has been an evolution of new paradigm, which is the Internet of Things, IoT. In the IoT, a large number of objects/devices on the Internet are connected to one another for information sharing, irrespective of their locations. These devices may be interconnected with one another using various network protocols and standards to exchange information between them. The underlying network used for information exchange generally has built-in intelligence, which is called ambient intelligence, so that it can make adaptive decisions for information exchange between these objects in theh IoT. This article provides a performance evaluation of the Bayesian coalition game among these objects in the IoT environment by using the concepts of game theory and LA. In comparison to the existing solutions, LA are assumed to be the players in the game having variable learning rates in the coalition game. Most of the existing solutions have considered constant learning rates of the players in the game, which may lead to the possibility of local optima at some points. Each player decides its actions using competitive learning, having variable learning rates, based on the newly defined utility function, which leads to the achievment of a Nash equilibrium in the game quickly. Each player receives feedback from the environment corresponding to the actions taken in a unit interval of time. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated with respect to various performance evaluation metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is useful in the IoT environment.",

      "abstract": "Future 5G deployments will embrace a multitude of novel technologies that will significantly change the air interface, system architecture, and service delivery platforms. However, compared to previous migrations to next-generation technologies, this time the implementation of mobile networks will receive particular attention. The virtualization of network functionality, the application of open, standardized, and inter-operable software, as well as the use of commodity hardware, will transform mobile-network technology. In this article we focus on the benefits, challenges, and limitations that accompany virtualization in 5G radio access networks (RANs). Within the context of virtualized RAN, we consider its implementation requirements and analyze its cost. We also outline the impact on standardization, which will continue to involve 3GPP but will engage new players whose inclusion in the discussion encourages novel implementation concepts.",

As the subcarrier SNRs for different cable modems are different, DOCSIS 3.1 allows adaptation of data transmission to cable modems by permitting multiple profiles. These provisions enable intelligent bit loading practices in DOCSIS 3.1. This article addresses the problem of assigning profiles to cable modems based on similarity in subcarrier SNRs. Simple algorithms are proposed to group together cable modems suitable for the same modulation profile. It is shown that as the number of allowed profiles increases, higher average data rate can be achieved.",

      "abstract": "This article presents an overview of the upcoming television broadcast spectrum incentive auction in the U.S., which will be the first ever attempted worldwide, and discusses the main business, regulatory, and technical challenges of a successful incentive auction. The process combines two separate but linked auctions: a reverse auction, which will identify the prices at which broadcasters are willing to relinquish their spectrum; and a forward auction, which will determine the price mobile network operators are willing to pay to acquire the new frequencies. The two auctions will determine the buyers and sellers and also the amount of spectrum to be cleared in the 600 MHz band after reorganizing the television stations that remain on air. This process is known as repacking and will create contiguous blocks of cleared spectrum at the high frequency side of the UHF band for mobile use. The article also reviews the potential plans for the 600 MHz band and discusses the opportunities that could bring about the new digital terrestrial television standard known as \u201cATSC 3.0.\u201d",

      "abstract": "To meet the increasing demands for popular content downloading services in next-generation cellular networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication was proposed to enable user equipments (UEs) to communicate directly over the D2D links in addition to traditional cellular operation by base stations (BSs), which is capable of utilizing the available cellular network's resource more efficiently to enhance content downloading performance. Although buffer-aided protocols may provide significant throughput gains in wireless networks, the opportunities and challenges of buffer-aided D2D communications are not yet fully understood. Differing from most existing works that focus on investigating buffering policy, we analyze the fundamental impact of the constrained buffers on the D2D communication underlaying cellular system by an optimization framework. Our study quantitatively reveals the positive correlation between the buffer sizes of BSs and UEs and the overall system performance, as well as further revealing the opportunities created by buffer-aided D2D communications for bandwidth conservation. In addition, we discuss practical challenges inherent in buffer-limited D2D communication underlaying next generation cellular networks, including increased transmission delay and optimal bandwidth allocation.",

      "abstract": "Database-assisted TV white space network is a promising paradigm of dynamic spectrum sharing, and can effectively improve spectrum utilization and alleviate spectrum scarcity via centralized control of TV white space databases residing in the cloud. In this article, we discuss business modeling for a database-assisted TV white space network, which is very important for wide commercialization of this promising technology. Motivated by several recent business practices, we propose and study two types of different business models: spectrum market and information market. In the spectrum market model, spectrum licensees, through spectrum brokers acted by databases, lease the underutilized (licensed) TV channels to unlicensed wireless devices for secondary utilization. In the information market model, databases sell the advanced information regarding (unlicensed) TV channels to unlicensed wireless devices in order to enhance the secondary spectrum utilization performance. We outline the corresponding trading mechanism details for both market models, and evaluate the feasibility and performance of both models through theoretical and numerical studies. Numerical results indicate that both the database operator's profit and the total network profit can be significantly improved under properly designed trading mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Information-centric networking (ICN) is an emerging networking paradigm that places content identifiers rather than host identifiers at the core of the mechanisms and protocols used to deliver content to end users. Such a paradigm allows routers enhanced with content-awareness to play a direct role in the routing and resolution of content requests from users, without any knowledge of the specific locations of hosted content. However, to facilitate good network traffic engineering and satisfactory user QoS, content routers need to exchange advanced network knowledge to assist them with their resolution decisions. In order to maintain the location-independency tenet of ICNs, such knowledge (known as context information) needs to be independent of the locations of servers. To this end, we propose CAINE \u2014 Context-Aware Information-centric Network Ecosystem \u2014 which enables context-based operations to be intrinsically supported by the underlying ICN routing and resolution functions. Our approach has been designed to maintain the location-independence philosophy of ICNs by associating context information directly to content rather than to the physical entities such as servers and network elements in the content ecosystem, while ensuring scalability. Through simulation, we show that based on such location-independent context information, CAINE is able to facilitate traffic engineering in the network, while not posing a significant control signalling burden on the network.",

      "abstract": "Network access plays an important role in LTE cognitive radio (LTE-CR) cellular networks in determining users' experiences. An overview is first carried out on network access schemes in existing cognitive cellular networks such as IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 1900.4, based on which it can be seen that cognitive pilot channel (CPC)-based network access is a promising scheme for LTECR, which may provide fast network access and put no stringent requirements on terminals. Next, considering the implementation issues of CPC in practical systems, a CPC-based backward- compatible network access scheme should be designed for LTE-CR to facilitate the application of CR in LTE networks, which could exploit existing LTE structures and technologies to carry CPC information. To achieve this, a new system information block (SIB) should be designed to carry CPC on a current physical downlink shared channel with little standards effort. Moreover, load awareness is introduced so that LTE-CR is activated only when the system load is high. The complete process of this SIB-CPC-based backward-compatible and loadaware network access is described, and its performance is evaluated via simulations. It is shown that the blocking ratio of LTE-CR can be reduced notably compared to that of conventional LTE without CR. Moreover, by selecting an appropriate load threshold to activate LTE-CR, the average user throughput of LTE can be improved with near-zero blocking ratio by offloading users to complementary cognitive spectra.",

      "abstract": "Data center interconnection with elastic optical networks is a promising scenario to meet the high burstiness and high-bandwidth requirements of services. Many data center services require lower delay and higher availability with end-to-end guaranteed QoS, which involves both application and transport network resources. However, in the current mode of operation, the control of elastic optical networks and data centers is separately deployed. Enabling even limited interworking among these separated control systems requires the adoption of complex and inelastic interfaces among the various networks, and this solution is not efficient enough to provide the required QoS. In this article, we present a novel cross stratum optimization (CSO) architecture in elastic data center optical interconnection. The proposed architecture can allow global optimization and control across elastic optical transport network and data center application stratum heterogeneous resources to meet the QoS requirement with the objective of optical as a service (OaaS). The functional modules of CSO architecture, including the core elements of application and transport controllers, are described in detail. The cooperation procedure in CSO-based service provisioning and cross stratum service resilience modes is investigated. The overall feasibility and efficiency of the proposed architecture is also experimentally demonstrated on our OaaS testbed with four OpenFlow-enabled elastic optical nodes, and compared to MFA, ALB, and CSO-DGLB service provisioning schemes in terms of path setup/release/adjustment latency, blocking probability, and resource occupation rate. Numerical results are given and analyzed based on the testbed. Some future discussion and exploration issues are presented in the conclusion.",

      "abstract": "Today's mobile customers desire to remain connected anywhere, at any time, and using any device. This phenomenon has encouraged mobile network operators to build complex network architectures by incorporating new features and extensions, which are harder to manage and operate. In this article we propose a novel and simplified architecture for mobile networks. The proposed architecture, which we call CSDN (Cellular SDN), leverages software defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV). SDN abstracts the network and separates the control plane from the data plane; NFV decouples logical network functions from the underlying hardware, for dynamic resource orchestration. Furthermore, we argue that dynamic resource orchestration and optimal control need real-time context data analyses to make intelligent decisions. Thus, in the proposed architecture we exploit the capability of the mobile edge networks to gather information related to the network as well as the users. This information can be used to optimize network utilization and application performance, and to enhance the user experience. In addition, the gathered data can be shared with third party service providers, enabling the realization of innovative services.",

      "abstract": "High-speed railway (HSR) communications have recently attracted much attention due to some specific railway needs, such as passenger experience services, business process support services, and operational data and voice services. The HSR radio channel, as a basis for the design of HSR communication systems and the evaluation of HSR communication technologies, has not yet been sufficiently investigated. This article focuses on radio channel sounding techniques for future HSR communication systems. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental features of measuring the HSR channel, and a review of the state of the art in HSR channel measurements is given. We also propose a novel LTE-based HSR channel sounding scheme and present results from our own measurement campaigns.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of connected devices and emerging data-hungry applications, the volume of mobile data traffic is predicted to have a 1000-fold growth by the year 2020. To address the challenge of this data explosion, industry and academia have initiated research and development of 5G wireless networks, which are envisaged to cater to the massive data traffic volume, while providing ubiquitous connectivity and supporting diverse applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. To support the expected massive growth of mobile data, a large number of small cells are expected to be deployed indoors and outdoors, giving rise to heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which are considered to be the key path toward 5G. With such large-scale HetNets, network operators face many serious challenges in terms of operation and management, cost-effective small cell deployment, and intercell interference mitigation. To deal with those issues, a cloud based platform is introduced, aiming to simplify the deployment, operation and management, and facilitate round-the-clock optimization of the network, to pave the way for the development of 5G. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the benefits of the cloud based architecture. Finally, the related standardization activities are provided and some research topics essential for a successful development of 5G are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses two strategies for managing sensing resources in the cloud and providing them as a service. The first strategy follows the data-centric model, where the cloud offers environmental data to its clients as a service, without any knowledge of how data are measured and processed. The second strategy adopts the device-centric model, which enables the cloud clients to use a virtual sensing infrastructure that they can customize for specific purposes. They can access sensed data and customize one or more virtual devices. The article also presents a cloud framework, called Cloud4Sens, that combines both the data-centric and device-centric models, enabling the end-user to choose which type of cloud service he needs. The proposed solution was designed according to the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) specifications defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium and exploits well known technologies, such as XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) communications and X509 certificates.",

      "abstract": "The rise of machine-to-machine communications has rekindled interest in random access protocols as a support for a massive number of uncoordinatedly transmitting devices. The legacy ALOHA approach is developed under a collision model, where slots containing collided packets are considered as waste. However, if the common receiver (e.g. base station) is able to store the collision slots and use them in a transmission recovery process based on successive interference cancellation, the design space for access protocols is radically expanded. We present the paradigm of coded random access, in which the structure of the access protocol can be mapped to a structure of an erasure-correcting code defined on a graph. This opens the possibility to use coding theory and tools for designing efficient random access protocols, offering markedly better performance than ALOHA. Several instances of coded random access protocols are described, as well as a case study on how to upgrade a legacy ALOHA system using the ideas of coded random access.",

      "abstract": "As two major players in terrestrial wireless communications, Wi-Fi systems and cellular networks have different origins and have largely evolved separately. Motivated by the exponentially increasing wireless data demand, cellular networks are evolving towards a heterogeneous and small cell network architecture, wherein small cells are expected to provide very high capacity. However, due to the limited licensed spectrum for cellular networks, any effort to achieve capacity growth through network densification will face the challenge of severe inter-cell interference. In view of this, recent standardization developments have started to consider the opportunities for cellular networks to use the unlicensed spectrum bands, including the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands that are currently used by Wi-Fi, Zigbee and some other communication systems. In this article, we look into the coexistence of Wi-Fi and 4G cellular networks sharing the unlicensed spectrum. We introduce a network architecture where small cells use the same unlicensed spectrum that Wi-Fi systems operate in without affecting the performance of Wi-Fi systems. We present an almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme without priority to mitigate the co-channel interference from small cells to Wi-Fi systems, and propose an interference avoidance scheme based on small cells estimating the density of nearby Wi-Fi access points to facilitate their coexistence while sharing the same unlicensed spectrum. Simulation results show that the proposed network architecture and interference avoidance schemes can significantly increase the capacity of 4G heterogeneous cellular networks while maintaining the service quality of Wi-Fi systems.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of wireless communication devices and the emergence of a variety of new applications have triggered investigations into next-generation mobile broadband systems, i.e. 5G. Legacy 2G-4G systems covering large areas were envisioned to serve both indoor and outdoor environments. However, in the 5G era, 80 percent of all traffic is expected to be generated indoors. Hence, the current approach of macrocell mobile networks, where there is no differentiation between indoors and outdoors, needs to be reconsidered. We envision 60 GHz mmWave picocell architecture to support highspeed indoor and hotspot communications. We envisage the 5G indoor network as a combination of, and interplay between, 2.4/5 GHz having robust coverage and 60 GHz links offering a high data rate. This requires intelligent coordination and cooperation. We propose a 60 GHz picocellular network architecture, called CogCell, leveraging ubiquitous WiFi. We propose to use 60 GHz for the data plane and 2.4/5GHz for the control plane. The hybrid network architecture considers an opportunistic fall-back to 2.4/5 GHz in case of poor connectivity in the 60 GHz domain. Further, to avoid the frequent re-beamforming in 60 GHz directional links due to mobility, we propose a cognitive module, a sensor- assisted intelligent beam switching procedure, that reduces communication overhead. We believe that the CogCell concept will help future indoor communications and possibly outdoor hotspots, where mobile stations and access points collaborate with each other to improve the user experience.",

In this article, we first outline the challenges in resource allocation posed by the coexistence of cellular and D2D users. Next, we provide a qualitative overview of the existing resource allocation and interference management policies for in-band D2D-enabled cellular networks. We then demonstrate how cognition along with limited information exchange between D2D users and the core network can be used to mitigate interference and enhance spectral efficiency of both cellular and D2D users. In particular, we propose a CSA scheme that exploits channel sensing and interference- aware decision making at the D2D terminals. This CSA scheme at the D2D terminals is complemented by a D2D-aware channel access method at the cellular BSs. The performance gains of the proposed CSA scheme are characterized in terms of channel access probability for a typical D2D transmitter and spectral efficiencies for both cellular and D2D transmissions. Finally, potential research issues that require further investigation are highlighted.",

However, these systems are spectrum limited due to the current spectrum allocation policies. This paper investigates the potential of applying cognitive radio techniques in satellite communications (SatCom) in order to increase the spectrum opportunities for future generations of satellite networks without interfering with the operation of incumbent services. These extra spectrum opportunities can potentially amount to 2.4 GHz of bandwidth in the downlink and 2 GHz of bandwidth in the uplink for high density fixed satellite services (HDFSS).",

      "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) is increasingly becoming a prominent technology within the 5G story, portrayed as a means of offloading traffic from the core network. The ever increasing demand for vehicular traffic consumption is providing the impetus for a new architectural design that can harness the benefits of D2D for vehicular users, taking a step toward offloading vehicular traffic from the core network. We propose the notion of extending D2D for vehicular scenarios with the potential to coordinate vehicular traffic using the LTE band. Furthermore, we then extend this approach by investigating cognitive radio in synergy with a geo-location database, to exploit white spaces as a means of further offloading vehicular users. Our simulation results have shown that our approach can outperform the legacy IEEE 802.11p in terms of delay.",

The connection oriented approach in Long Term Evolution (LTE) that involves establishing a bearer prior to data transmission is inefficient for small burst traffic because of the signaling involved. We propose a connectionless access method for efficient small burst transmission for future cellular networks. With the proposed protocol for connectionless access, over-the-air signaling can potentially be reduced substantially while meeting the security requirements of mobile networks.",

In practice, each DTN node can store information for a long time before forwarding it. DTNs are particularly suited to cope with the challenges imposed by the space environment. This paper is focused on routing in space DTNs, and in particular on contact graph routing (CGR) and its most representative enhancements, available in the literature, which are briefly surveyed in this work. Moreover, the applicability and the obtained performance of the DTN protocol stack and of the CGR have been evaluated by presenting results from real experimental experiences such as the Deep Impact Network experiment (employing the EPOXI space cruise), the JAXA jointly performed space link demonstrations with NASA (where the JAXA's GEO relay satellite called Data Relay Test Satellite has been used), the Space Data Routers European Project, and the pilot operation of a DTN implementation on the International Space Station (ISS).",

      "abstract": "Due to the rapid growth of network traffic and new demands from mobile users, the current mobile social networks face challenges in dealing with a huge amount of content requests, high operating costs, and mobility control. How to design mobile social networks efficiently for the upcoming 5G era has become an important issue. In this article we propose and outline a framework of content centric mobile social networks for 5G. First, we present a content centric based network architecture consisting of mobile users, communities, content centric nodes, small cells, and macro cells. Next, we discuss the detailed process to deliver mobile content based on the interests of content and mobile users. In addition, a novel caching scheme is presented to store replicas of mobile content, and the related experiment results are also given.",

      "abstract": "Content-Centric Networks (CCNs) are fundamental evolutionary technologies that promise to form the cornerstone of the future Internet. The information flow in these networks is based on named data requesting, in-network caching, and forwarding, which are unique and can be independent of IP routing. As a result, common IP-based network tools such as ping and traceroute can neither trace a forwarding path in CCNs nor feasibly evaluate CCN performance. We propose \u201ccontrace,\u201d a network tool for CCNs (particularly, CCNx implementation running on top of IP) that can be used to investigate the round-trip time (RTT) between content forwarder and consumer, the states of in-network cache per name prefix, and the forwarding path information per name prefix. We report a series of experiments conducted using contrace on a CCN topology created on a local testbed and the GEANT network topology emulated by the Mini-CCNx emulator. The results confirm that contrace is not only a useful tool for monitoring and operating a network, but also a helpful analysis tool for enhancing the design of CCNs. Further, contrace can report the number of received interests per cache or per chunk on the forwarding routers. This enables us to estimate the content popularity and design more effective cache control mechanisms in experimental networks.",

      "abstract": "Vehicular communications are emerging as a promising technology to enable communications using vehicles as network nodes. VDTNs appear as a novel approach to enable services and applications where it is not possible to define an end-to-end path. To allow communications in such challenging environments, VDTNs rely for their operation on cooperation between network nodes, which contributes to increasing network connectivity and improving overall network performance. To accomplish such a task, nodes may be asked to share their constrained storage, bandwidth, and energy resources with one another. However, nodes may be unwilling to cooperate in order to save resources or due to selfish behavior. This kind of node severely affects the network functionality. This article gives an overview of the field, providing motivations, challenges, and an evaluation of the impact of cooperative measures on the performance of VDTN networks.",

      "abstract": "With the proliferation of mobile devices and emerging data-hungry applications, mobile data has been increasing dramatically. To accommodate massive mobile data, the cellular network has been straining to meet the need due to the scarcity of spectrum. As a promising technology, cognitive radio can be leveraged by the cellular network to harvest spectrum holes on demand. By employing cognitive radio, the cellular network becomes a cognitive cellular network. In this article, we first provide an overview of the cognitive cellular network, including the network architecture and main applications. Then existing spectrum harvesting approaches are reviewed, and the limitations are identified. To better explore spectrum access opportunities, three types of cooperation-based approaches are introduced for different scenarios, based on which an integrated cooperative framework is devised to fully harvest spectrum holes. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed cooperative approaches.",

      "abstract": "We consider spectrum sharing between a limited set of operators having similar rights for accessing spectrum. A coordination protocol acting on the level of the RAN is designed. The protocol is non-cooperative, but assumes an agreement to a set of negotiation rules. The signaling overhead is low, and knowledge of a competitor\u2019s channel state information is not assumed. No monetary transactions are involved; instead, spectrum sharing is based on a RAN-internal virtual currency. The protocol is applicable both in a scenario of mutual renting and when the operators form a spectrum pool. The protocol reacts to variations in interference and load of operators, and shows gains in a simulated small cell scenario.",

      "abstract": "A virtualized network infrastructure is composed of multiple virtualized network functions (VNF) interconnected by well defined interfaces, and thus forming a VNF-graph. The initial deployment of such a VNF-graph inside a data center (DC) is a complex task with multidimensional aspects compared to deploying a single VNF that may represent a single network function. The problem space becomes more complex when each VNF is further decomposed into multiple VNF components (VNFC), where each VNFC embodies a subset of network functions attributed to the respective VNF. The challenge is to ensure that the deployment strategy meets the intra-functional constraints between the multiple VNFCs constituting the VNF-graph while ensuring service, performance and operational integrity, and also ensures optimal utilization of the underlying resources of the DC infrastructure (DCI). In this article we analyze the cost incurred by two \u201cconstraint-based heuristically applied\u201d initial VNF/VNFC deployment strategies with reference to a virtualized mobile network infrastructure providing EPCaaS (evolved packet core as a service) while taking into consideration functional and administrative constraints. The cost of deployment is measured in terms of the utilization of DC infrastructure resources such as compute and networking. We also present the discussion in view of the ETSI NFV MANO framework, undergoing standardization, that is responsible for management and orchestration of NFV systems including VNF deployment.",

      "abstract": "The energy cost of cellular networks is ever increasing to match the surge of wireless data traffic, and savings in this cost is important to reduce the operational expenditure of wireless operators in the future. Recent advancements in renewable energy integration and two-way energy flow in smart grid provide potential new solutions to save cost. However, they also impose challenges, especially on how to use the stochastically and spatially distributed renewable energy harvested at cellular BSs to reliably supply time- and space-varying wireless traffic over cellular networks. To overcome these challenges, in this article we present three approaches, energy cooperation, communication cooperation, and joint energy and communication cooperation, in which different BSs bidirectionally trade or share energy via the aggregator in smart grid, and/or share wireless resources and shift loads with each other to reduce the total energy cost.",

      "abstract": "The tremendous growth of machine-tomachine (M2M) applications has been a great attractor to cellular network operators to provide machine-type communication services. One of the important challenges for cellular systems supporting M2M terminals is coverage, because terminals can be located in spaces in buildings and structures suffering from significant penetration losses. Since these terminals are also often stationary, they are permanently without cellular coverage. To address this critical issue, the third generation partnership project (3GPP), and in particular its radio access network technical specification group, commenced work on coverage enhancement (CE) for long-term evolution (LTE) systems in June 2013. This article reviews the CE objectives defined for LTE machine-type communication and presents CE methods for LTE downlink and uplink channels discussed in this group. The presented methods achieve CE in a spectrally efficient manner and without notably affecting performance for legacy (non- M2M) devices.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the development of technology and the emergence of intelligent services smart cities promise to their inhabitants enhanced perception of city life. For example, a live timetable service of public transportation can increase the efficiency of travel planning substantially. However, its implementation in a traditional way requires the deployment of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure. Mobile crowdsensing is an alternative, when the crowd of passengers and their mobile devices are used to gather data for almost free of charge. In this paper, we put the emphasis on the introduction of our crowdsensing based public transport information service, what we have been developing as a prototype smart city application. The front-end interface of this service is called TrafficInfo. It is a simple and easy-to-use Android application which visualizes real-time public transport information of the given city on Google Maps. The lively updates of transport schedule information relies on the automatic stop event detection of public transport vehicles. TrafficInfo is built upon our Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based communication framework what we designed to facilitate the development of crowd assisted smart city applications. The paper introduces shortly this framework, than describes TrafficInfo in detail together with the developed stop event detector.",

      "abstract": "The advancements in microwave power transfer (MPT) over recent decades have enabled wireless power transfer over long distances. The latest breakthroughs in wireless communication - massive MIMO, small cells, and millimeterwave communication - make wireless networks suitable platforms for implementing MPT. This can lead to the elimination of the \u201clast wires\u201d connecting mobile devices to the grid for recharging, thereby tackling a huge long-standing ICT challenge. Furthermore, the seamless integration between MPT and wireless communication opens up a new area called wirelessly powered communications (WPC) where many new research directions arise, such as simultaneous information and power transfer, WPC network architectures, and techniques for safe and efficient WPC. This article provides an introduction to WPC by describing the key features of WPC, shedding light on a set of frequently asked questions, and identifying the key design issues and discussing possible solutions.",

      "abstract": "One of the key research issues in further strengthening the role of railways in the transportation system is to achieve the highest possible level of cyber security against significant threats to the signaling and telecom systems. The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) was designed in the 1990s with the security measures and strategies available at the time. However, ERTMS' underlying communication technology, GSM-R, needs replacing, and replacement strategies are already underway. Due to their direct effects on safety, ERTMS security mechanisms also need updating to face current security threats. This article provides a security analysis of ERTMS' safety layer, Euroradio, in terms of current security threats. After identifying its vulnerabilities, we present four main recommendations: a more robust cryptographic mechanism, a new key distribution scheme, a new key storage and system integrity module, and a set of countermeasures for avoiding radio jamming attacks.",

The proliferation of industrial and agricultural activities in modern society, however, poses threats to water resources in the form of chemical, biological, and thermal pollution. On the other hand, tremendous advancements in science and technology offer valuable tools to address water sustainability challenges. Key technologies, including sensing technology, wireless communications and networking, hydrodynamic modeling, data analysis, and control, enable intelligently wireless networked water cyber-physical systems (CPS) with embedded sensors, processors, and actuators that can sense and interact with the water environment. This article provides an overview of water CPS for sustainability from four critical aspects: sensing and instrumentation; communications and networking; computing; and control. The article also explores opportunities and design challenges of relevant techniques.",

      "abstract": "Energy harvesting technology has become a promising solution to enhance the energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in future wireless systems. In future wireless systems, most of the data throughput will come from delay-sensitive applications. To ensure a good experience for an end user, we target the optimization of the delay performance of an EH wireless system with finite energy storage. As such, it is necessary to adapt the resource allocation to the channel fading information, data queue length, and energy queue length information. The channel fading information provides the channel quality, the data queue length information provides the dynamic urgency of the transmitted data flows, and the energy queue length information provides the information on how much available energy is left in the energy buffer. Such a problem is quite challenging because it belongs to an infinite dimensional stochastic optimization. In this article, we review the existing works on the resource allocation problem in EH wireless systems. We also propose a low-complexity delay-sensitive resource control scheme and discuss valuable design insights.",

A variety of routing schemes have been proposed to provide communication services in DTNs, and credible and flexible protocol evaluation tools are in demand in order to test these DTN routing schemes. By examining the evolution of DTN protocol testing and evaluation, this article discusses the trend toward large-scale mobility trace supported emulation, and we propose TUNIE, a large-scale emulation testbed for DTN protocol evaluation based on network virtualization. Unlike the existing simulation tools and real-life testbeds, which either cannot provide a realistic DTN environment setup or are too costly and time-consuming, our proposed TUNIE architecture is capable of simulating reliable DTN environments and obtaining an accurate system performance evaluation. By system prototype and implementation, we demonstrate TUNIE as a flexible platform for evaluating DTN protocol performance.",

The sensor network platform supports heterogeneous protocols in the network layer and performs ID-based communications to deliver sensor data from the sensors to the sinks, as well as to send control and monitoring commands from the sensor owner or administrator to the mobile sensors and mobile sensor gateways. To provide sensor data reliably irrespective of the sensor locations, the mobile sensors and mobile sensor gateways natively support mobility and multihoming and possess network access authentication and data transport security functions. The sensor owners can freely install new applications over already-deployed mobile sensors and mobile sensor gateways. They can configure the mobile sensors to operate in lightweight or full-function modes depending on the sensor application requirements or available networking environments. The technical feasibility of the proposed mobile sensor network platform has been demonstrated by implementing a prototype system.",

      "abstract": "During the past 20 years, space communications technologies have shown limited progress in comparison to Internet-based networks on Earth. However, a brand new working group of the IETF with focus on DTN promises to extend today's Internet boundaries to embrace disruptive communications such as those seen in space networks. Nevertheless, several challenges need to be overcome before operative DTNs can be deployed in orbit. We analyze the state of the art of effective design, planning, and implementation of the forthcoming network communications opportunities (contacts). To this end, different modeling techniques, system constraints, selection criteria, and methods are reviewed and compared. Finally, we discuss the increasing complexity of considering routing and traffic information to enrich the planning procedure, yielding the need to implement a contact plan computation element to support space DTN operation.",

      "abstract": "In recent years there has been a strong desire in the U.S. Department of Defense to augment traditional ground and satellite communications with a high capacity aerial tier. High capacity airborne links are often directional in nature and highly affected by aircraft body blockage, exhibiting unique outage characteristics compared to ground or satellite networks. To mitigate the effects of periodic link outages that last seconds to minutes, disruption tolerant networking (DTN) technology has been proposed. In this article we examine applying the DTN Bundle Protocol (RFC 5050) to ship-to-shore networks for traffic flowing over the aerial nodes. Specifically, we examine applying DTN proxies, tunnels, and interfaces to both the plaintext and ciphertext side of military networks to understand architecture and design considerations and limitations.",

Security and trust are of paramount importance. Among various emerging security issues, FDI attacks are one of the most substantial ones, which can significantly increase the cost of the energy distribution process. However, most current research focuses on countermeasures to FDIs for traditional power grids rather smart grid infrastructures. We propose an efficient and real-time scheme to detect FDI attacks in smart grids by exploiting spatial-temporal correlations between grid components. Through realistic simulations based on the US smart grid, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides an accurate and reliable solution.",

      "abstract": "Although software-defined networking (SDN) brings numerous benefits by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, there is a contradictory relationship between SDN and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. On one hand, the capabilities of SDN make it easy to detect and to react to DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the separation of the control plane from the data plane of SDN introduces new attacks. Consequently, SDN itself may be a target of DDoS attacks. In this paper, we first discuss the new trends and characteristics of DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments. We show that SDN brings us a new chance to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments, and we summarize good features of SDN in defeating DDoS attacks. Then we review the studies about launching DDoS attacks on SDN and the methods against DDoS attacks in SDN. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges that need to be addressed to mitigate DDoS attached in SDN with cloud computing. This work can help understand how to make full use of SDN's advantages to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments and how to prevent SDN itself from becoming a victim of DDoS attacks.",

      "abstract": "The distributed inference framework comprises a group of spatially distributed nodes that acquire observations about a POI and transmit computed summary statistics to the fusion center. Based on the messages received from the nodes, the FC makes a global inference about the POI. The distributed and broadcast nature of such systems makes them quite vulnerable to different types of attacks. This article focuses on efficient mitigation schemes to mitigate the impact of eavesdropping on distributed inference and surveys the currently available approaches along with avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand of mobile Internet traffic is pushing operators to look for solutions to increase the available bandwidth per user and per unit of area. At the same time, they need to reduce the load in the core network at a reasonable cost in their future 5G deployments. Today's trend points to the deployment of extremely dense networks in order to provide ubiquitous connectivity at high data rates. However, this is hard to couple with the current mobile networks' architecture, which is heavily centralized, posing difficult challenges when coping with the foreseen explosion of mobile data. Additionally, future 5G networks will exhibit disparate types of services, posing different connectivity requirements. Distributed mobility management is emerging as a valid framework to design future mobile network architectures, taking into account the requirements for large traffic in the core and the rise of extremely dense wireless access networks. In this article, we discuss the adoption of a distributed mobility management approach for mobile networks, and analyze the operation of the main existing solutions proposed so far, including a first practical evaluation based on experiments with real Linux-based prototype implementations.",

We focus on multicarrier technologies, which have been recognized as capable of flexible utilization of fragmented spectrum opportunities in unlicensed frequency bands, such as enhanced NC-OFDM and NC-FBMC. These techniques can be applied to shape the signal spectrum so that it is concentrated within used frequency bands, and the out-of-band transmitted power and associated interference generated to the incumbent coexisting systems are limited. We present key issues associated with spectrum aggregation that are recognized at the transmitter and the receiver. We also discuss solutions of these issues that can make spectrum aggregation viable for 5G systems.",

This full-duplex wireless offers the potential for a doubling of spectral efficiency; however, the requirement for high transmit-to-receive isolation presents formidable challenges for the designers of full duplex transceivers. Electrical balance in hybrid junctions has been shown to provide high transmit- to-receive isolation over significant bandwidths. Electrical balance duplexers require just one antenna, and can be implemented on-chip, making this an attractive technology for small form factor devices. However, the transmit-to-receive isolation is sensitive to antenna impedance variation in both the frequency domain and time domain, limiting the isolation bandwidth and requiring dynamic adaptation. Various contributions concerning the implementation and performance of electrical balance duplexers are reviewed and compared, and novel measurements and simulations are presented. Results demonstrate the degradation in duplexer isolation due to imperfect system adaptation in user interaction scenarios, and requirements for the duplexer adaptation system are discussed.",

Enabling D2D communications over directional mmWave networks is of critical importance to efficiently use the large bandwidth to increase network capacity. In this article, the propagation features of mmWave communication and the associated impacts on 5G cellular networks are discussed. We introduce an mmWave+4G system architecture with TDMA-based MAC structure as a candidate for 5G cellular networks. We propose an effective resource sharing scheme by allowing non-interfering D2D links to operate concurrently. We also discuss neighbor discovery for frequent handoffs in 5G cellular networks.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative applications for VANETs will require seamless communication between vehicle to infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle. IEEE 802.11p has been developed to facilitate this effort. However, in order to have seamless communication for these applications, it is necessary to look at handover as vehicles move between roadside units. Traditional models of handover used in normal mobile environments are unable to cope with the high velocity of the vehicle and the relatively small area of coverage with regard to vehicular environments. The Y-Comm framework has yielded techniques to calculate the time before vertical handover and the network dwell time for any given network topology. Furthermore, by knowing these two parameters, it is also possible to improve channel allocation and resource management in network infrastructure such as base stations, relays, and so on. In this article we explain our overall approach by describing the VANET Testbed and show that in vehicular environments it is necessary to consider a new handover model that is based on a probabilistic rather than a fixed coverage approach. Finally, we show a new performance model for proactive handover, which is then compared with traditional approaches.",

      "abstract": "Small cell networks have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years due to their potential to meet the exponential growth of mobile data traffic, and the increasing demand for better quality of service and user experience in mobile applications. Nevertheless, wide deployment of small cell networks has not happened yet because of the complexity in the network planning and optimization, as well as the high expenditure involved in deployment and operation. In particular, it is difficult to provide grid power supply to all the small cell base stations in a cost-effective way. Moreover, a dense deployment of small cell base stations, which is needed to meet the capacity and coverage of next generation wireless networks, will increase operators' electricity bills and lead to significant carbon emission. Thus, it is crucial to exploit off-grid and green energy sources to power small cell networks, for which energy harvesting technology is a viable solution. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive study of energy harvesting small cell networks, and investigate important aspects, including a feasibility analysis, network deployment, and network operation issues. The advantages as well as unique challenges of energy harvesting small cell networks are highlighted, together with potential solutions and effective design methodologies.",

      "abstract": "Network infrastructure sharing and base station switching off mechanisms have been recently introduced as promising solutions toward energy and cost reduction in cellular networks. Although these techniques are usually studied independently, their combination offers new alternatives to MNOs for serving their users and could potentially provide them with additional benefits. In this article we introduce the concept of intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing, where the MNOs may switch off their BSs and roam their traffic to active BSs operated by other MNOs in the same cell. Motivated by the coexistence of multiple operators in the same area, we present possible network deployments and architectures in current and future cellular scenarios, discussing their particular characteristics. In addition, we propose an innovative distributed game theoretic BS switching off scheme, employing an integrated cost function that takes into account all the different cases for a given operator to serve its own traffic (i.e. through active BSs of neighboring cells or exploiting intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing). Finally, we demonstrate some indicative simulation results in realistic scenarios to quantify the potential energy and financial benefits that our proposed scheme offers to the MNOs in multi-operator environments, providing them with the necessary incentives to participate in the infrastructure sharing.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency and resilience are two well established research topics in optical transport networks. However, their overall objectives (i.e., power minimization and resource utilization/ availability maximization) conflict. In fact, provisioning schemes optimized for best resilience performance are in most cases not energy-efficient in their operations, and vice versa. However, very few works in the literature consider the interesting issues that may arise when energy efficiency and resilience are combined in the same networking solution. The objective of this article is to identify a number of research challenges and trade-offs for the design of energy-efficient and resilient optical transport networks from the perspective of long-term traffic forecasts, short-term traffic dynamics, and service level agreement requirements. We support the challenges with justifying numbers based on lessons learned from our previous work. The article also discusses suitable metrics for energy efficiency and resilience evaluation, in addition to a number of steps that need to be taken at the standardization level to incorporate energy efficiency into already existing and well established protocols.",

      "abstract": "Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of current efforts indicate that engineering programs lack consistent, accurate, and reliable methods of teaching professional ethics and measuring their outcomes. This raises two equally important issues: how we teach ethics and which student outcomes we are assessing. Engineering students are performing poorly on the Ethics part of the Fundamental Engineering exam, so clearly there is a misalignment between teaching practice and outcomes. Engineering ethics instruction is often focused on the instruction of moral judgment and assessing ethical awareness via students' responses to vignettes describing ethical dilemmas. In this study, we propose extending current practice from a focus on teaching moral reasoning to also considering students' ethical awareness and future behavior. We introduce motivational variables that engineering educators should consider when designing ethics curricula. The study findings suggest that these motivational factors may influence students' ethical awareness and predict their ethical behavior.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi provides cost-effective data capacity at hotspots in conjunction with broadband cellular networks. The hotspots are required to capture a large number of users and provide high data rates. Data rates, over the Wi-Fi interface, are influenced by the media access protocol, which loses throughput due to contention based protocol delays and unintended collisions when a large number of users are active. The hotspot range that determines the number of users that can associate is limited by the lower power of the client rather than the access point. By diverting the traffic destined to the access point via another access network, both range and efficiency can be improved. This uplink redirection or diversion is achieved by simultaneous use of the Wi-Fi and LTE radio interfaces. Three options, loose, tight, and hybrid integration, are presented to providing enhanced capacity and coverage.",

      "abstract": "The very original concept of cognitive radio raised by Mitola targets at all the environment parameters, including those in the physical, MAC, and application layers, as well as the information extracted from reasoning. Hence, the first CR is also referred to as \u201cfull cognitive radio.\u201d However, due to its difficult implementation, the FCC and Simon Haykin separately proposed a very simplified definition, in which CR mainly detects a single parameter, spectrum occupancy, and is also called \u201cspectrum sensing cognitive radio.\u201d With the rapid development of wireless communications, the infrastructure of a wireless system becomes much more complicated, while the functionality at every node is desired to be as intelligent as possible, say self organized capability approaching 5G cellular networks. It is then interesting to reconsider Mitola's definition and think whether one could, besides obtaining the on/off status of the licensed user only, achieve more parameters in a cognitive way. In this article, we propose a new cognitive architecture targeting multiple parameters for future cellular networks, which is one step further toward \u201cfull cognition\u201d compared to most existing CR research. The new architecture is elaborated in detailed stages, and three representative examples are provided based on recent research progress to illustrate the feasibility as well as the validity of the proposed architecture.",

      "abstract": "Two emerging technologies in the automotive domain are autonomous vehicles and V2X communication. Even though these technologies are usually considered separately, their combination enables two key cooperative features: sensing and maneuvering. Cooperative sensing allows vehicles to exchange information gathered from local sensors. Cooperative maneuvering permits inter-vehicle coordination of maneuvers. These features enable the creation of cooperative autonomous vehicles, which may greatly improve traffic safety, efficiency, and driver comfort. The first generation V2X communication systems with the corresponding standards, such as Release 1 from ETSI, have been designed mainly for driver warning applications in the context of road safety and traffic efficiency, and do not target use cases for autonomous driving. This article presents the design of core functionalities for cooperative autonomous driving and addresses the required evolution of communication standards in order to support a selected number of autonomous driving use cases. The article describes the targeted use cases, identifies their communication requirements, and analyzes the current V2X communication standards from ETSI for missing features. The result is a set of specifications for the amendment and extension of the standards in support of cooperative autonomous driving.",

      "abstract": "Financial organizations communicate with each other using ISO 8583 or its derivatives to complete the request and response cycle of card originated transactions originated from an ATM, POS, or the web. ISO 8583 is a broad standard. Its implementations slightly vary due to the flexibility available within the standard. This paper discusses the problem of adaptability of communication between payment card transaction processing entities due to this flexibility. We first provide an overview of different variations in ISO 8583 implementations and identify the interoperability issue based on our industry experience. We then propose a solution and suggest a way to standardize different implementations so that one organization can communicate with another without or with minimal changes in software. The suggestion is based on the exchange of meta data indicating how the target system is interpreting the header fields during the communication process.Finally, we discuss the benefits of the solution in which the vendors could not only avail the customization flexibility provided by ISO8583 but also ensure that their implementation of the standard is interoperable with others. This reduces the cost of interconnectivity with other partners when a network wants to expands its business.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews an emerging wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) technique with an emphasis on its performance enhancement employing multi-antenna techniques. Compared to traditional wireless information transmission, WIPT faces numerous challenges. First, it is more susceptible to channel fading and path loss, resulting in a much shorter power transfer distance. Second, it gives rise to the issue of how to balance spectral efficiency for information transmission and energy efficiency for power transfer in order to obtain an optimal tradeoff. Third, there exists a security issue for information transmission in order to improve power transfer efficiency. In this context, multi-antenna techniques, e.g. energy beamforming, are introduced to solve these problems by exploiting spatial degree of freedom. This article provides a tutorial on various aspects of multi-antenna based WIPT techniques, with a focus on tackling the challenges by parameter optimization and protocol design. In particular, we investigate the WIPT tradeoffs based on two typical multi-antenna techniques: the limited feedback multi-antenna technique for short-distance transfer; and the large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO, also known as massive MIMO) technique for long-distance transfer. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",

Various secrecy signaling and coding schemes have been designed at the physical layer of wireless systems to guarantee confidentiality against information leakage to unauthorized receivers, among which the strategy based on the idea of node cooperation is promising. This article provides an overview of the recent research on enhancing wireless transmission secrecy via cooperation.

Although existing approaches can achieve a reasonable precision, they rely on fine-grained sensor data with high sampling rate. Therefore, these approaches come with a high cost and are only studied in small samples of volunteers and thus cannot benefit large-scale Internet users. In this article we propose a method to use crowd-sourced location data from mobile devices to estimate the home and work locations of large-scale users, leveraging the computation power of the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves a good estimation precision. Moreover, we further study how the estimated home and work locations can be used in two typical applications that are difficult problems using traditional methods but can be elegantly solved by leveraging the proposed crowd-sourced approach.",

Conventional network security mechanisms are incompetent to overcome these challenges, since they are built on a static network configuration that facilitates attackers in finding the weaknesses of a network. In this article, we conceive a novel conceptual network security mechanism, the evolving defense mechanism (EDM), to resolve current and future security problems. EDM is based on a bio-inspired idea of network configuration variations. According to the security requirements of the system, the user, and the network security state, EDM selects an efficient network configuration variation strategy to prevent corresponding security threats. Combined with SDN implementation, EDM resolves security problems from a new angle and is capable of evolving with new network security technology. We sketch a way to implement EDM and present its reference framework, which serves as an ecosystem and coexisting environment for various kinds of network configuration variations.

The short link distance and lower transmit power of device-to-device communications make them excellent candidates to exploit full duplex inband transmission. By incorporating power allocation for self-interference cancellation based on antenna isolation, analog cancellation, and digital cancellation, full-duplex device-to-device, FD-D2D, nodes can potentially improve spectrum efficiency in HetNets. We provide a comprehensive overview on FD-D2D communications in Het-Nets. Additionally, we identify several challenges, provide potential solutions to interference mitigation based on power control, beamforming, and resource scheduling, and further discuss applications of FD in 5G networks.",

With this mobile cloud, mobile crowdsourcing, as an emerging service paradigm, can enable mobile users to take over the outsourced tasks. By leveraging the sensing capabilities of mobile devices and integrating humanintelligence and machine-computation, mobile crowdsourcing has the potential to revolutionize the approach of data collecting and processing. In this article we investigate the mobile crowdsourcing architecture and applications, then discuss some research challenges and countermeasures for developing mobile crowdsourcing.

      "abstract": "Tactical networking environments present many challenges in terms of bandwidth, latency, reliability, stability, and connectivity. Sensors can today generate very large data sets that exceed the ability of tactical networks to transfer and disseminate them in a timely manner. Furthermore, the desire to cover larger areas with persistent sensing capabilities, have resulted in the widescale deployment of inexpensive sensors, further widening the gap between the volume of information that is generated and the subset that can successfully be delivered to consumers. This article explores the notion of determining the value of information in order to prioritize and filter information that is disseminated over these tactical networks, focusing on the dissemination of information to and from dismounted soldiers in a battlefield environment. This is a promising approach to mitigate the constraints of tactical networks and to reduce information overload on soldiers.",

      "abstract": "Thin-film transistor technologies have great potential to become the key technology for leaf-node Internet of Things by utilizing the NFC protocol as a communication medium. The main requirements are manufacturability on flexible substrates at a low cost while maintaining good device performance characteristics, necessary to be compatible with the NFC specifications. Such low-cost flexible NFC tags can be attached to any object with any form factor, connecting this object to the Internet using a smartphone or tablet as an intermediate node. Among all commercial thin-film transistor technologies, metal oxide transistors is a viable technology for this application. The metal-oxide transistors in this work are based on InGaZnO as semiconductor. Since these are unipolar by nature (i.e., they exhibit only n-type transistors), different options to make logic circuits are studied from static and dynamic points of view. The different topologies are diode-load logic, dual-gate diode-load logic, and pseudo-CMOS logic. The static parameters lead to a comparison of soft yield between those circuit topologies, while the transient analysis provides insight on the power consumption and circuit speed. This is indicative for selecting the logic style matching the data rate requirements of the NFC standards. Moreover, metal-oxide NFC circuits that combine 12-bit code generators to the analog front-end of RFID tags are integrated on a PCB board to evaluate performance of a matched and optimized system. The measured data rates of these integrated NFC tags are compatible with the ISO 15693 specifications. Finally, a fully integrated, flexible NFC tag is realized, which comprises the tuning capacitor, rectifier, load modulator, and code generator.",

      "abstract": "In the face of relentless growth in traffic, network operators must continuously forecast bandwidth demand to properly dimension their networks and make the correct investments for the future. The consequences of under-investing are poor network performance and dissatisfied subscribers, while over-investing ties up capital that could have been better spent elsewhere. In this article we describe a model that forecasts bandwidth demands of aggregated subscribers on residential fixed access networks. For sustained bandwidth demand, we use statistical techniques to quantify the number of concurrent video streams, the shifting mix of standard definition, high definition, and ultra high definition resolutions, multicast gain, and the trend from multicast to unicast delivery of these streams. Mechanisms to cope with bursty bandwidth demand are included. The results we report can guide operators in making technology and network design choices for future FTTx deployments.",

A major concern is that such imminent transition is happening at a rate far exceeding the evolution of security solutions. In fact, the transformation of mobile devices into highly capable computing platforms makes the possibility of security attacks originating from within the mobile network a reality. Today, mobile devices are capable of initiating sophisticated cyberattacks, especially when they coordinate together to form what we call a MobiBot. MobiBots differ from classical botnets in that they exploit mobile operating system vulnerabilities and the advantages of device-to-device communication to mask malicious code propagation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in antenna and RF circuit design have greatly reduced the crosstalk between the transmitter and receiver circuits on a wireless device, which enable radios to transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Such a full duplex radio has the potential to double the spectral efficiency of a point-to-point radio link. However, the application of such a radio in current cellular systems (3GPP LTE) has not been comprehensively analyzed. This article addresses the fundamental challenges in incorporating full duplex radios in a cellular network to unlock the full potential of full duplex communications. We observe that without carefully planning, full duplex transmission might cause much higher interference in both uplink and downlink, which greatly limits the potential gains. Another challenge is that standard scheduling methods which attempt to achieve the maximum capacity gain lead to a severe loss in energy efficiency. In this article, we identify new tradeoffs in designing full duplex enabled radio networks, and discuss favorable conditions to operate in full duplex mode. New scheduling algorithms and advanced interference cancellation techniques are discussed, which are essential to maximize the capacity gain and energy efficiency. Under this new design, most of the gain is achievable with full duplex enabled base stations, while user equipment still operates in half duplex mode.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of demand for ever increasing data rates, spectrum resources have become more and more scarce. As a promising technique to increase the efficiency of the spectrum utilization, cognitive radio has great potential to meet such a requirement by allowing unlicensed users to coexist in licensed bands. In conventional CR systems, spectrum sensing is performed at the beginning of each time slot before data transmission. Unfortunately, this results in two major problems: transmission time reduction due to sensing, and sensing accuracy impairment due to data transmission. To tackle these problems, in this article we present a new design paradigm for future CR by exploring full duplex techniques to achieve simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission. With FD radios equipped at secondary users (SUs), the SUs can simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum, and thus significantly improve sensing performance while increasing data transmission efficiency. The aim of this article is to transform the promising conceptual framework into a practical wireless network design by addressing a diverse set of challenges such as protocol design and theoretical analysis. Several application scenarios with FD-enabled CR are elaborated, and key open research directions and novel algorithms in these systems are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The wireless research community aspires to conceive full duplex operation by supporting concurrent transmission and reception in a single time/frequency channel for the sake of improving the attainable spectral efficiency by a factor of two as compared to the family of conventional half duplex wireless systems. The main challenge encountered in implementing FD wireless devices is that of finding techniques for mitigating the performance degradation imposed by self-interference. In this article, we investigate the potential FD techniques, including passive suppression, active analog cancellation, and active digital cancellation, and highlight their pros and cons. Furthermore, the troubles of FD medium access control protocol design are discussed for addressing the problems such as the resultant end-to-end delay and network congestion. Additionally, an opportunistic decode-and-forward- based relay selection scheme is analyzed in underlay cognitive networks communicating over independent and identically distributed Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels in the context of FD relaying. We demonstrate that the outage probability of multi-relay cooperative communication links can be substantially reduced. Finally, we discuss the challenges imposed by the aforementioned techniques and a range of critical issues associated with practical FD implementations. It is shown that numerous open challenges, such as efficient SI suppression, high-performance FD MAC-layer protocol design, low power consumption, and hybrid FD/HD designs, have to be tackled before successfully implementing FD-based systems.",

      "abstract": "Wireless networks composed of energy harvesting devices will introduce several transformative changes in wireless networking as we know it: energy self-sufficient, energy self-sustaining, perpetual operation; reduced use of conventional energy and accompanying carbon footprint; untethered mobility; and an ability to deploy wireless networks in hard-to-reach places such as remote rural areas, within structures, and within the human body. Energy harvesting brings new dimensions to the wireless communication problem in the form of intermittency and randomness of available energy, which necessitates a fresh look at wireless communication protocols at the physical, medium access, and networking layers. Scheduling and optimization aspects of energy harvesting communications in the medium access and networking layers have been relatively wellunderstood and surveyed in the recent paper [1]. This branch of literature takes a physical layer rate-power relationship that is valid in energy harvesting conditions under large-enough batteries and long-enough durations between energy harvests so that information-theoretic asymptotes are achieved, and optimizes the transmit power over time in order to maximize the throughput. Another branch of recent literature aims to understand the fundamental capacity limits, i.e. information-theoretic capacities, of energy harvesting links under smaller scale dynamics, considering energy harvests at the channel use level. This branch necessitates a deeper look at the coding and transmission schemes in the physical layer, and ultimately aims to develop an information theory of energy harvesting communications, akin to Shannon's development of an information theory for average power constrained communications. In this introductory article, we survey recent results in this branch and point to open problems that could be of interest to a broad set of researchers in the fields of communication theory, information theory, signal processing, and networking. In particular, we review capacities of energy harvesting links with infinite-sized, finitesized, and no batteries at the transmitter.",

      "abstract": "The future development of the railway is highly desired to evolve into a new era where infrastructure, trains, travelers, and goods will be increasingly interconnected to provide high comfort, with optimized door-to-door mobility at higher safety. For this vision, it is required to realize seamless high data rate wireless connectivity for railways. To improve the safety and comfort of future railways, wireless communications for railways are required to evolve from only voice and traditional train control signaling services to various high data rate services including critical high-definition (HD) video and other more bandwidth-intensive passenger services, such as onboard and wayside HD video surveillance, onboard real-time high data rate services, train multimedia dispatching video streaming, railway mobile ticketing, and the Internet of Things for railways. Corresponding mobile communications network architecture under various railway scenarios including inter-car, intra-car, inside station, train-to-infrastructure and infrastructure- to-infrastructure are proposed in this article. Wireless coverage based on massive MIMO for railway stations and train cars is proposed to fulfill the requirement of high-data-rate and high spectrum efficiency. The technical challenges brought by the massive MIMO technique are discussed as well.",

      "abstract": "Unlike most general wireless users enjoying broadband access to the Internet and so on, a number of mission-critical applications such as PPDR are using narrowband systems that are only capable of transmitting voice and low-rate data. Broadband wireless networks with greater reliability are increasingly demanded by these applications including the emerging Smart Grid. With this vision, the IEEE 802.16 Working Group completed two standard amendments recently, IEEE Std 802.16n-2013 and IEEE Std 802.16.1a-2013. 802.16 network reliability is significantly increased by technical developments dealing with failures of network infrastructure stations, radio path and backhaul connectivity, and so on. This article serves to analyze the envisaged typical use cases of greater reliable broadband wireless networks, outline the main technical developments of the two standards, and introduce a recently developed practical system for PPDR applications in Japan.",

Decentralized operation is considered for the green energy optimization in the EH-WSN. The optimization is achieved in two dimensions: dynamic (activation) mode adaptation in the temporal dimension and energy balancing in the spatial dimension. Due to the interactions among autonomous distributed sensors, game theory is applied to the local information based decentralized optimization for the spatial energy balancing problem. In addition, reinforcement learning techniques are proposed to address the temporal mode adaptation in the dynamic and unknown environment. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

Although this concept has emerged primarily to enhance spectrum utilization and to allow the coexistence of heterogeneous network technologies, the importance of energy consumption imposes additional challenges, because energy consumption and communication performance can be at odds. In this article the approaches for energy efficient spectrum sensing and spectrum handoff, fundamental building blocks of cognitive networks, are investigated. The trade-offs between energy consumption and throughput, under local as well as under cooperative sensing, are characterized. We also discuss the additional factors that need to be investigated to achieve energy efficient cognitive operation under various application requirements.",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth of mobile multimedia traffic calls for scalable wireless access with high quality of service and low energy cost. Motivated by the emerging energy harvesting communications, and the trend of caching multimedia contents at the access edge and user terminals, we propose a paradigm shifting framework, GreenDelivery, enabling efficient content delivery with energy harvesting based small cells. To resolve the two-dimensional randomness of energy harvesting and content request arrivals, proactive caching and push are jointly optimized, with respect to the content popularity distribution and battery states. We thus develop a novel way of understanding the interplay between content and energy over time and space. Case studies are provided to show the substantial reduction of macro BS activities, and thus the related energy consumption from the power grid is reduced. Research issues of the proposed GreenDelivery framework are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Widely deployed encryption-based security prevents unauthorized decoding, but does not ensure undetectability of communication. However, covert, or low probability of detection/intercept communication is crucial in many scenarios ranging from covert military operations and the organization of social unrest, to privacy protection for users of wireless networks. In addition, encrypted data or even just the transmission of a signal can arouse suspicion, and even the most theoretically robust encryption can often be defeated by a determined adversary using non-computational methods such as side-channel analysis. Various covert communication techniques have been developed to address these concerns, including steganography for finite-alphabet noiseless applications and spread-spectrum systems for wireless communications. After reviewing these covert communication systems, this article discusses new results on the fundamental limits of their capabilities, and provides a vision for the future of such systems as well.",

To provide good quality of service (e.g., low access delay) to their clients, FB relies on Akamai, which provides a worldwide content distribution network with a large number of edge servers that are much closer to FB subscribers. In this article we aim to depict a global picture of the current FB network infrastructure deployment taking into account both native FB servers and Akamai nodes. Toward this end, we have performed a measurement-based analysis during a period of two weeks using 463 Planet- Lab nodes distributed across 41 countries. Based on the obtained data we compare the average access delay that nodes in different countries experience accessing both native FB servers and Akamai nodes. In addition, we obtain a wide view of the deployment of Akamai nodes serving FB users worldwide. Finally, we analyze the geographical coverage of those nodes, and demonstrate that in most of the cases Akamai nodes located in a particular country service not only local FB subscribers, but also FB users located in nearby countries.",

      "abstract": "Heterogeneous networks, HetNets, are known to enhance the bandwidth efficiency and throughput of wireless networks by more effectively utilizing the network resources. However, the higher density of users and access points in HetNets introduces significant inter-user interference that needs to be mitigated through complex and sophisticated interference cancellation schemes. Moreover, due to significant channel attenuation and the presence of hardware impairments, e.g. phase noise and amplifier nonlinearities, the vast bandwidth in the millimeterwave band has not been fully utilized to date. In order to enable the development of multi-Gigabit per second wireless networks, we introduce a novel millimeter-wave HetNet paradigm, termed hybrid HetNet, which exploits the vast bandwidth and propagation characteristics in the 60 GHz and 70-80 GHz bands to reduce the impact of interference in HetNets. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance advantage of hybrid HetNets with respect to traditional networks. Next, two specific transceiver structures that enable hand-offs from the 60 GHz band, i.e. the V-band to the 70-80 GHz band, i.e. the E-band, and vice versa are proposed. Finally, the practical and regulatory challenges for establishing a hybrid HetNet are outlined.",

      "abstract": "When public transportation stations have access points to provide Internet access to passengers, public transportation becomes a more attractive travel and commute option. However, the Internet connectivity is intermittent because passengers can access the Internet only when a transit vehicle is within the networking coverage of an access point at a stop. We propose ICOW, a system that provides a low-cost way for public transit operators to enhance quality of experience for passengers who access the Internet. Each public transit vehicle is equipped with a smart cache that serves popular content to passengers. The cache updates its content based on passenger requests when it is within range of Internet access points placed at stops, stations, or depots. We have developed a system architecture and built a prototype of the ICOW system. Our evaluation shows that ICOW is significantly more efficient than having passengers contact Internet access points individually and ensures continuous availability of content throughout the journey.",

      "abstract": "A new generation of satellite systems that support regenerative on-board processors (OBPs) and multiple spot beam technology have opened new and efficient possibilities of implementing IP multicast communication over satellites. These new features have widened the scope of satellite-based applications and also enable satellite operators to efficiently utilize their allocated bandwidth resources. This makes it possible to provide cost effective satellite network services. IP multicast is a network layer protocol designed for group communication to save bandwidth resources and reduce processing overhead on the source side. The inherent broadcast nature of satellites, their global coverage (air, land, and sea), and direct access to a large number of subscribers imply satellites have unrivalled advantages in supporting IP multicast applications. IP mobility support in general and IP mobile multicast support in particular on mobile satellite terminals like the ones mounted on long haul flights, maritime vessels, continental trains, etc., still remain big challenges that have received very little attention from the research community. This paper proposes how Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6)-based IP multicast mobility support defined for terrestrial networks can be adopted and used to support IP mobile multicast in future satellite networks, taking cognizance of the trend in the evolution of satellite communications.",

      "abstract": "The carbon footprint of cellular base stations is a source of concern not only because of their power consumption, which accounts for more than half of all of the cellular infrastructure, but also because of the large rate of growth in their deployment. This article discusses how the use of harvested renewable energy can contribute to solving this problem. The article also addresses the challenges associated with harvesting wind and solar energy, namely the variability in available energy and the large physical footprint of energy harvesters. This article explains that these challenges can be better addressed by jointly considering the harvested energy availability and the dynamic characteristics of base station power consumption. A realization of this approach is the recently introduced idea of a \"sustainable wireless area\" that integrates energy harvesters and a group of base stations in a microgrid architecture. This architecture enables an integrated harvested energy-cellular traffic management technique that shapes the traffic serviced by a base station based on the predicted availability of renewable energy. As a result, longer periods of operation powered from renewable energy are achieved while degradation of the users' qualityof- experience (QoE) is minimal and occasional. This article also explains how harvested renewable energy also increases the resiliency of cellular networks because they do not depend on lifelines for operation.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communications engineers may face complex ethical dilemmas while designing products for consumers. At Florida International University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, we place great importance on training our students to address such ethical dilemmas, in alignment with ABET requirements. To this end, an ethical training framework is integrated into our two-semester senior design project course. In addition to the codes of ethics, our students use \"The Theory Model\" to make decisions based on ethical theories. For the solution of ethical dilemmas by means of ethical theories, they apply a modified version of the line drawing method. In this article we briefly explain the theories and methods that our students consider when facing ethical dilemmas. Then we present excerpts from four past senior design projects related to wireless communications. We also summarize the methodology the students use for identifying the best option to address ethical dilemmas.",

      "abstract": "Wireless communications are critical for public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) professionals during the emergency operations that follow natural or man-made disasters, scenarios in which both commercial and dedicated terrestrial networks often fail to provide the necessary support. The reason is threefold: they simply get destroyed by the disaster, they cannot sustain the sudden surge of network demand or they fail to deliver the necessary bandwidth and/or other QoS guarantees. Because LTE is expected to become the main wireless technology for broadband communication, a lot of studies have been devoted to assess its compliance for PPDR purposes and to find suitable architectural solutions able to meet mission-critical requirements. This approach is surely worthy, but it is based on the assumption that infrastructure-based terrestrial systems are reliable. As a consequence, in worst-case emergency scenarios appropriate guarantees can be provided only in the hypothesis of huge investment costs. Recent developments in satellite technologies are bringing the availability of non-terrestrial high performance channels, with better properties when comparing to LTE for what regards availability and reliability. On this basis, the paper proposes a network architecture based on the integration of satellite and LTE networks for both infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less scenarios. The proposal aims to provide field operators and people in distress with transparent accessibility, coverage guarantees and broadband performance when terrestrial infrastructures are lacking, and to expand their coverage, capacity and resilience otherwise.",

      "abstract": "The promise of ubiquitous and super-fast connectivity for the upcoming years will be in large part fulfilled by the addition of base stations and spectral aggregation. The resulting very dense networks (DenseNets) will face a number of technical challenges. Among others, the interference emerges as an old acquaintance with new significance. As a matter of fact, the interference conditions and the role of aggressor and victim depend to a large extent on the density and the scenario. To illustrate this, downlink interference statistics for different 3GPP simulation scenarios and a more irregular and dense deployment in Tokyo are compared. Evolution to DenseNets offers new opportunities for further development of downlink interference cooperation techniques. Various mechanisms in LTE and LTE-Advanced are revisited. Some techniques try to anticipate the future in a proactive way, whereas others simply react to an identified interference problem. As an example, we propose two algorithms to apply time domain and frequency domain small cell interference coordination in a DenseNet.",

      "abstract": "Through its history the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has witnessed great inventions and has played an active role in the technology development that has been shaping the world of telecommunications. The ITU milestones are numerous. One of them is of particular importance because it symbolizes better than any other the need for harmonious worldwide development and desire for universal cooperation. It was established at the Atlantic City conference in 1947 when the entry of ITU into the United Nations (UN) family as a Specialized Agency for Telecommunications was decided. By the end of the 1980s the technology evolution and fresh regulatory dynamism announced global changes in the national and international telecommunication environment and consequently in the role of the ITU Constituencies. For different reasons, the Union has not adapted itself with sufficient speed to these processes and over the years the technical spirit of the Atlantic City conference has been weakening and political debates have been installed instead. Performance of the ITU mission has been suffering due to its increasingly weaker leadership and inefficient governing bodies. The most recent ITU Plenipotentiary Conference, held in Busan in 2014, was facing the challenge to address the need for reforms in order to ensure the sustainability of the Union into the future and reinforce its status as an advocate of global technical excellence. Unfortunately, the need for reform was not specifically recognized and reflected in the Objectives enunciated in the Strategic Plan for the Union for the period 2016-2019, and any reorganization of the structure and functioning of the Union, currently recognized as being archaic and conservative, was left in abeyance. The analysis made and the conclusions reached in this paper may assist future high-level discussions on the subject matter and may facilitate an early promotion of the ITU Reform Policies. The reform guidelines offered herein may also further reinforce the views of those Member States that are sincerely concerned and interested in creating a new paradigm for a better future of their Union.",

      "abstract": "This article analyzes the impact that sleep mode (SM)-based green strategies have on the reliability performance of optical and cellular network elements. First, we consider a device in isolation (i.e., not plugged into a network in operation), showing how operational temperature and temperature variations, both introduced by SM, impact its lifetime. We then evaluate, from an operational cost perspective, the impact of these lifetime variations, showing that some devices are critical, that is, their achievable energy savings might not cover the potential additional reparation costs resulting from being put in SM too frequently. Moreover, we present a model for evaluating the impact of SM on the lifetime of a device plugged into an operational network. The analysis considers two case studies (one based on the optical backbone and one on cellular networks) showing that the lifetime of a device is influenced by both the hardware parameters, which depend on the specific design of the device, and the SM parameters, which instead depend on the energy-efficient algorithm used, the network topology, and the traffic variations over time. Our results show that (i) the changes in the operational temperature and the frequency of their variation are two crucial aspects to consider while designing a SM-based green strategy, and (ii) the impact of a certain SM-based strategy on the lifetime of network devices is not homogeneous (i.e., it can vary through the network).",

This article realizes the huge potential of combining the two for high wireless information transfer (WIT) and WET. In particular, to maximize the synergy, the distributed version of massive MIMO (known as massive distributed antenna system, MDAS) is advocated to go with the joint wireless information and energy transfer (JWIET) system capable of both WIT and WET. We present the opportunities in MDAS-JWIET, and discuss research trends in MDAS with several architectures involving WET and WIT.",

      "abstract": "In ambient assisted living, one of the most concerning problems is how the living status of the elderly can be accurately judged through the data collected by ambient sensors. To solve this problem, environmental influences should be sufficiently considered. Some researchers have proposed collecting data comprehensively by distributed environmental sensors, but how the massive collected data were to be analyzed and transmitted was ignored. In this article, we propose a local data processing architecture on a local server to analyze collected data. In this three-layer architecture, the latest received data is stored in a data gathering layer. Afterward, a data filtering layer checks the efficiency of data. Also, this layer classifies the received data into static data reflecting sensors\u2019 status and a realtime data stream reflecting quality of life. For static data, they are directly stored in a database, and the real-time data stream is divided into different levels. Based on these levels, a data analyzing layer reorganizes data into a neighborhood structure, which will be called RDAA. A risk factor is returned by RDAA and only abnormal data will be sent to a health care provider when its risk factor is larger than a given threshold. LDAP disperses the stress of remote centralized processing and data storage, which decreases the workload of the remote health care provider. Meanwhile, it also reduces network load and improves processing speed.",

      "abstract": "The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) splits current IP addresses overlapping semantics of identity and location into two separate names-paces. Since its inception the protocol has gained considerable attention from both industry and academia, motivating several new use cases to be proposed. Despite its inherent control-data decoupling and the abstraction and flexibility it introduces into the network, little has been said about the role of LISP on the SDN paradigm. In this article we try to fill that gap and analyze if LISP can be used for SDN. The article presents a systematic analysis of the relevant SDN requirements and how such requirements can be fulfilled by the LISP architecture and components. This results in a set of benefits (e.g. incremental deployment, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, and inter-domain support) and drawbacks (e.g. extra headers and some initial delay) of using LISP for SDN. In order to validate the analysis, we have built and tested a prototype using the LISPmob open-source implementation.",

      "abstract": "With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, large-scale antenna systems in the mmWave bands can potentially help to meet the anticipated demands of mobile traffic in the 5G era. There are many challenging issues, however, regarding the implementation of digital beamforming in large-scale antenna systems: complexity, energy consumption, and cost. In a practical large-scale antenna deployment, hybrid analog and digital beamforming structures can be important alternative choices. In this article, optimal designs of hybrid beamforming structures are investigated, with the focus on an N (the number of transceivers) by M (the number of active antennas per transceiver) hybrid beamforming structure. Optimal analog and digital beamforming designs in a multi-user beamforming scenario are discussed. Also, the energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency of the N \u00d7 M beamforming structure are analyzed, including their relationship at the green point (i.e., the point with the highest energy efficiency) on the energy efficiency-spectrum efficiency curve, the impact of N on the energy efficiency performance at a given spectrum efficiency value, and the impact of N on the green point energy efficiency. These results can be conveniently utilized to guide practical LSAS design for optimal energy/ spectrum efficiency trade-off. Finally, a reference signal design for the hybrid beamform structure is presented, which achieves better channel estimation performance than the method solely based on analog beamforming. It is expected that large-scale antenna systems with hybrid beamforming structures in the mmWave band can play an important role in 5G.",

Although the problem of spectrum and power allocation is well addressed in the literature, the need for more efficient algorithms still persists due to the exponential growth of the number of wireless devices. Thus, developing efficient distributed approaches has become an attractive solution that can follow the systems' rapid growth. Despite the number of economicdriven methods that have been presented, such as game theoretic solutions, these methods still rely on excessive information exchange, which results in high delays. Inspired by the success of behavioral techniques, mainly learning and filtering approaches, applications of these techniques to spectrum management have attracted more interest due to their distributivity and minimal requirements of information exchange.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of video sharing over social networks is straining service providers to maintain high quality of service. With the introduction of live video streaming over social networks, video sharing is truly becoming social and real time. However, existing video distribution architecture, split across content providers and mobile network operators, cannot leverage crossprovider information. We argue that MNOs can explore the knowledge of users' location to route video traffic intelligently. This can enable better quality of experience for live social video sharing. We show different scenarios in existing cellular networks, where user experience can suffer due to current video distribution mechanism. We propose that use of the location information of the receiver with respect to the sender can be exploited by next generation cellular networks for improving video streaming quality. Our simulation experiments validate that on all QoE metrics there is opportunity for significant improvement in live video streaming by using relative locations of the receivers and senders.",

M2M devices can be used for a wide range of emerging applications that have various communications requirements. While M2M communications have been developed for many years, major challenges still remain with their efficient implementation from the perspective of low energy consumption and wide coverage. To address these challenges, low power wide area (LPWA) technology is investigated as one of the potential candidate solutions. In this article, we first introduce some typical LPWA M2M application scenarios. Given their requirements, we highlight key techniques and standards that are explicitly designed for LPWA M2M communications. Finally, we present an LPWA prototype system to evaluate its performance and demonstrate its potential in bridging a technological gap for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.",

To spread these applications widely, cellular systems are considered as a potential candidate to provide connectivity for MTC devices. The ubiquitous deployment of these systems reduces network installation cost and provides mobility support. However, based on the service functions, there are key challenges that currently hinder the broad use of cellular systems for MTC. This article provides a clear mapping between the main MTC service requirements and their associated challenges. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of these challenges and the potential solutions. This study presents, in part, a roadmap from the current cellular technologies toward fully MTC-capable 5G mobile systems.",

      "abstract": "As the commercial operation of 4G systems is speeding up worldwide to meet the increasingly explosive growth of mobile Internet in the 2020 era, a great many R&amp;D efforts targeting the next generation wireless systems (5G) have been launched. With densely deployed small cells in a heterogeneous network, the excessive signaling overhead of conventional carrier design greatly degrades system performance. A new carrier designed for small cells in the next generation system will be highly beneficial toward a green communication network. In this article, we propose a macro-assisted data-only carrier for future 5G networks from a green prospective. With the help of macro base stations, control channel overhead, and cell-specific reference signals for small cells can be minimized to achieve a pure-data carrier. Under this architecture, key procedures are designed including small cell identification and access, synchronization, hand over, and small cell sleeping. Furthermore, to evaluate the potential of our proposed scheme, a complete system and link-level simulation platform according to the current 3GPP LTE standard is built. The simulation results show that our proposed systems, achieving significant performance enhancement of signaling overhead, can lead to more than 17 percent throughput improvement and 90 percent energy efficiency gain over the current LTE HetNet with on-off strategy implemented. The proposed scheme appears to be highly attractive as part of the future 5G green mobile networks.",

The objective of this model is to support SON mechanisms based on the knowledge of the user equipment location in a small cell network, the use of such information being a key enabler for advanced SON methods. The defined design is the basis for systems providing innovative location-aware SON techniques that make use of user localization in medium/large indoor areas (e.g., malls or corporate buildings). The functional and physical characteristics of this architecture and their technical implications are analyzed. Proposed innovations to generic mobile architecture are described as well as specific implementation for LTE/LTE-A standards. Interoperability with standard management systems and localization services, congestion avoidance, and data offloading are the key drivers of the design. Finally, the capabilities of the proposed architecture are demonstrated through the performance analysis of a simple key use case for location-aware self-optimization.",

In particular, the need for self-organizing solutions to manage the scarce spectral resources has become a prevalent theme in many emerging wireless systems. In this article, the first comprehensive tutorial on the use of matching theory, a Nobel Prize winning framework, for resource management in wireless networks is developed. To cater for the unique features of emerging wireless networks, a novel, wireless-oriented classification of matching theory is proposed. Then the key solution concepts and algorithmic implementations of this framework are exposed. The developed concepts are applied in three important wireless networking areas in order to demonstrate the usefulness of this analytical tool. Results show how matching theory can effectively improve the performance of resource allocation in all three applications discussed.",

      "abstract": "For continuous services of mobile user equipment (UE), Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems conduct evolved node B (eNB) switching based on hard handover technology, which breaks a connection before the connection to the target eNB (T-eNB) is made. As handover service interruption seriously degrades network performance, precise knowledge of the handover (HO) performance is necessary in finding out defects of the current system and discovering clues for improvements. Although the performance of LTE handover and its anticipated effect on network services are important evaluation indexes, in existing literature only the theoretical performance is analyzed and very few actual measurements on practical LTE networks have been presented. In this article, the HO delay and handover interruption time (HIT) performance of LTE networks are measured for several cases in accordance with the average number of users in a cell. Based on the internal HO procedures that influence HO delay and HIT, the key parameters are analyzed. In addition, based on the estimated number of users in a cell, a reference probability density function (PDF) that can be used for HIT prediction is presented.",

This article provides an overview of the mechanisms and open issues for mobility-augmented service provisioning in MCC. We first outline the concept, system architecture, and taxonomy of research issues. Then we introduce three key mechanisms with respect to mobility augmentation, heterogeneous network convergence and mobile service provisioning. Moreover, we discuss the open challenges to reveal the future direction of MCC.",

However, to fully exploit the benefits of FD technology in a wireless network, in addition to the physical (PHY) layer issues, medium access control (MAC) layer issues such as inter-node collisions, fairness between half-duplex (HD) and FD users, opportunistic selection of different modes of FD transmission, and synchronization issues need to be resolved. To this end, this article first discusses the fundamental concepts, potential benefits, and primary network topologies of FD transmission. We then highlight immediate challenges (both in the PHY and MAC layers) that need to be addressed in designing FD wireless systems. A qualitative comparison among the existing full-duplex MAC (FD-MAC) protocols is then provided. Finally, the primary requirements and research issues for the design of FD-MAC protocols are discussed, and implications of FD technology in cellular wireless networks are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Optical WDM backbone networks based on fixed spectrum grid have limitations such as low spectrum utilization and rigidity in provisioning for heterogeneous rates. Flexible-grid technologies can alleviate these limitations for on-demand provisioning. These technologies represent promising candidates for future optical networks supporting beyond-100-Gb/s signals. However, a one-time green-field deployment of flexible-grid technologies may not be practical, as the already-made investment in existing fixed-grid WDM networks needs to be preserved, and interruptions to ongoing services need to be minimized. Therefore, we envision that fixed-and flexible-grid technologies will coexist, which will bring the challenge of interoperating fixed-and flexible-grid equipment. It is also important to design the optimum migration strategy to maximize cost effectiveness and minimize service interruption. In this article, we discuss the key aspects of network architectures supporting coexistence of fixed and flexible grid technologies, and outline the challenges of network operations. We also propose and evaluate different migration strategies from fixed grid to flexible grid under different network scenarios.",

Specific challenges for mmWave communication design include large-scale attenuation, atmospheric absorption, phase noise, limited gain amplifiers, and so on. This article aims to define and evaluate important metrics to characterize multimedia QoS and jointly takes these technical challenges into account in the framework of mmWave. To this end, we design a QoS-aware multimedia scheduling scheme to achieve the trade-off between performance and complexity, in which accurate propagation analysis is carried out and suitable countermeasure techniques are pointed out to satisfy the QoS requirements. Moreover, potential multimedia applications are analyzed and possible solutions provided. Illustrative results indicate that the proposed multimedia scheduling scheme can perform efficiently in a practical mmWave communication system.",

While offloading has been widely considered for saving energy and increasing responsiveness of mobile devices, the technique still faces many challenges pertaining to practical usage. In this article, we adopt a systemic approach for analyzing the components of a generic code offloading architecture. Based on theoretical and experimental analysis, we identify the key limitations for code offloading in practice and then propose solutions to mitigate these limitations. We develop a generic architecture to evaluate the proposed solutions. The results provide insights regarding the evolution and deployment of code offloading.",

      "abstract": "With the growing popularity of mobile Internet, providing secure wireless services has become a critical issue. Physical layer security (PHY-security) has been recognized as an effective means to enhance wireless security by exploiting wireless medium characteristics, for example, fading, noise, and interference. A particularly interesting PHY-security technology is cooperative relay due to the fact that it helps to provide distributed diversity and shorten access distance. This article offers a tutorial on various multi-antenna relaying technologies to improve security at physical layer. The state-of-the-art research results on multi-antenna relay aided PHY-security as well as some secrecy performance optimization schemes are presented. In particular, we focus on large-scale MIMO relaying technology, which is effective in tackling various challenging issues for implementing wireless PHY-security, such as short-distance interception without eavesdropper CSI and with imperfect legitimate CSI. Moreover, the future directions are identified for further enhancement of secrecy performance.",

      "abstract": "With the formidable growth of various booming wireless communication services that require ever increasing data throughputs, the conventional microwave band below 10 GHz, which is currently used by almost all mobile communication systems, is going to reach its saturation point within just a few years. Therefore, the attention of radio system designers has been pushed toward ever higher segments of the frequency spectrum in a quest for increased capacity. In this article we investigate the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of future wireless communications over the E-band frequencies. We start with a brief review of the history of the E-band spectrum and its light licensing policy as well as benefits/challenges. Then we introduce the propagation characteristics of E-band signals, based on which some potential fixed and mobile applications at the E-band are investigated. In particular, we analyze the achievability of a nontrivial multiplexing gain in fixed point-to-point E-band links, and propose an E-band mobile broadband (EMB) system as a candidate for the next generation mobile communication networks. The channelization and frame structure of the EMB system are discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Communications in the ether are highly susceptible to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. To improve communication confidentiality in wireless environments, research efforts have been made to complement cryptography with physical layer security. A recent view of the role of interference, especially in multi-tier wireless networks, suggested that interference engineering can increase the level of communication confidentiality. The design of interference engineering strategies (IESs) requires a thorough characterization of concurrent effects of wireless emissions on legitimate and eavesdropping receivers. This article advocates IESs for achieving a new level of communication confidentiality in multi-tier wireless networks (namely multi-tier network secrecy) with different degrees of coordination among the tiers. Insights on how IES benefits wireless network secrecy are provided, guiding the design of such strategies for a new level of communication confidentiality.",

      "abstract": "The 5G network infrastructure is driven by the evolution of today's most demanding applications. Already, multimedia applications such as on-demand HD video and IPTV require gigabit- per-second throughput and low delay, while future technologies include ultra HDTV and machine-to-machine communication. Mm-Wave technologies such as IEEE 802.15.3c and IEEE 802.11ad are ideal candidates to deliver high throughput to multiple users demanding differentiated QoS. Optimization is often used as a methodology to meet throughput and delay constraints. However, traditional optimization techniques are not suited to a mixed set of multimedia applications. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is shown as a promising technique in this context. Channel-time allocation PSO (CTA-PSO) is successfully shown here to allocate resource even in scenarios where blockage of the 60 GHz signal poses significant challenges.",

      "abstract": "Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) is a network architecture characterized by the lack of continuous connectivity. Messages are delivered by moving nodes in a store-and-forward manner. In such a network, the mobility models of nodes play an important role in DTNs, because messages can only be delivered when two or more nodes contact each other. In general, mobility models can be categorized into synthetic and trace models. Synthetic models are based on mathematical models that generate the mobility models. Trace models record people's daily movements in the real world; these models faithfully render the actual situation of people's movements in their lives. However, there is a challenge in studying human mobility, and the mobility models of humans affect the performance of routing protocols in DTNs. In this article, we design an Android application to collect the mobility traces of college students in a campus environment, called NCCU Trace Data. We design a mobility model that traces students' movement, and this model can be imported into the ONE simulator to verify routing protocols. More importantly, it can be used to evaluate the performance of a social-based routing method. Finally, we evaluate our routing method and compare it to other routing methods in each mobility model. The simulation results show that our newly designed mobility model is a step closer to the real environment.",

      "abstract": "Software defined networking has garnered large attention due to its potential to virtualize services in the Internet, introducing flexibility in the buffering, scheduling, processing, and routing of data in network routers. SDN breaks the deadlock that has kept Internet network protocols stagnant for decades, while applications and physical links have evolved. This article advocates for the use of SDN to bring about 5G network services by incorporating network coding (NC) functionalities. The latter constitutes a major leap forward compared to the state-ofthe- art store and forward Internet paradigm. The inherent flexibility of both SDN and NC provides fertile ground to envision more efficient, robust, and secure networking designs, which may also incorporate content caching and storage, all of which are key challenges of the upcoming 5G networks. This article not only proposes the fundamentals of this intersection, but also supports it with key use cases and a thorough performance evaluation on an implementation that integrated the Kodo library (NC) into OpenFlow (SDN). Our results on singlehop, multihop, and multi-path scenarios show that gains of 3x to 11x are attainable over standard TCP and multi-path TCP.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge of end-to-end network distances is essential to many service-oriented applications such as distributed content delivery and overlay network multicast, in which the clients have the flexibility to select their servers from among a set of available ones based on network distance. However, due to the high cost of global measurements in large-scale networks, it is infeasible to actively probe end-to-end network distances for all pairs. In order to address this issue, network distance prediction has been proposed by measuring a few pairs and then predicting the other ones without direct measurements, or splicing the path segments between each pair via observation. It is considered important to improve network performance, and enables service- oriented applications over large-scale networks. In this article, we first illustrate the basic ideas behind network distance prediction, and then categorize the current research work based on different criteria. We illustrate how different protocols work, and discuss their merits and drawbacks. Finally, we summarize our findings, and point out potential issues and future directions for further research.",

      "abstract": "Cellular networks are confronted with unprecedented pressure to accommodate the dramatically increasing demands of mobile Internet. This phenomenon is principally due to the restricted spectrum resource and low-efficiency spectrum management. Recently, cognitive radio technology has been corroborated to significantly improve spectrum utilization efficiency. In order to enhance the spectrum management efficiency in cellular networks, the concept of \u201ccognitive cellular networks\u201d was introduced. It has been realized that the network architecture, algorithms, and protocols cannot be simply designed without considering the socio-economic aspects involved. In this article, we consider the economic issues in cognitive cellular networks from the perspectives of game theoretic modeling and mechanism design. Specifically, both the simultaneous and sequential dynamic spectrum access games are investigated, respectively. The mechanism design related issues (i.e., spectrum auction, pricing, and contract) to ensure desired outcomes are introduced with detailed applications in cognitive cellular networks. The goal of this article is to provide an overview to understand the motivation, problem formulation, methodology, and solutions of the economic issues in cognitive cellular networks.",

In contrast to a wired network, the software defined wireless network (SDWN) experiences more challenges due to the fast-changing wireless channel environment. This article focuses on the state-of-the-art of SDWN architecture, including control plane virtualization strategies and semantic ontology for network resource description. In addition, a novel SDWN architecture with resource description function is proposed, along with two ontologies for the resource description of the latest wireless network. Future research directions for SDWN, control strategy design, and resource description are also addressed.",

As an integral part of the future Internet-of-Things (IoT), the true vision of M2M communications cannot be reached with conventional solutions that are typically cost inefficient. The cognitive radio concept has emerged to address spectrum under-utilization and scarcity. The heterogeneous network model is another alternative to relax the number of covered users. To this extent, we present a complete fundamental understanding and the engineering details of cognitive radios, the heterogeneous network model, and power and cost challenges in the context of future M2M cellular networks.",

In order for core and metropolitan telecommunication systems to be able to catch up with Internet traffic, which keeps growing exponentially, we exploit the elastic optical networks paradigm for its astounding characteristics: flexible bandwidth allocation and reach tailoring through adaptive line rate, modulation formats, and spectral efficiency. We emphasize the novelties stemming from the flex-grid concept and report on the corresponding proposed target network scenarios. Fundamental building blocks, like the bandwidth-variable transponder and complementary node architectures ushering those systems, are detailed focusing on physical layer, monitoring aspects, and node architecture design.",

Considering these requirements, within the European project IDEALIST the investigation of elastic optical networks is undertaken with special focus on next generation optical node architectures. As an evolution of existent ROADMs and OXCs, these optical nodes will establish a new paradigm in which the network requirements will be efficiently addressed considering various emerging dimensions. In this article, we describe the drivers, architectures, and technologies that will enable these novel optical nodes. In addition, multivendor traffic interoperability, optical defragmentation, and node cascadability are also described as considerations in the node design.",

A general architecture supporting super-channels (i.e., optical connections composed of several adjacent subcarriers) and sliceability (i.e., subcarriers grouped in a number of independent super-channels with different destinations) is presented. Several transponder implementations supporting different transmission techniques are considered, highlighting advantages, economics, and complexity. Discussions include electronics, optical components, integration, and programmability. Application use cases are reported.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand of mobile Internet and the Internet of Things poses challenging requirements for 5G wireless communications, such as high spectral efficiency and massive connectivity. In this article, a promising technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), is discussed, which can address some of these challenges for 5G. Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation. We divide existing dominant NOMA schemes into two categories: power-domain multiplexing and code-domain multiplexing, and the corresponding schemes include power-domain NOMA, multiple access with low-density spreading, sparse code multiple access, multi-user shared access, pattern division multiple access, and so on. We discuss their principles, key features, and pros/cons, and then provide a comprehensive comparison of these solutions from the perspective of spectral efficiency, system performance, receiver complexity, and so on. In addition, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for NOMA design are highlighted to provide some insight on the potential future work for researchers in this field. Finally, to leverage different multiple access schemes including both conventional OMA and new NOMA, we propose the concept of software defined multiple access (SoDeMA), which enables adaptive configuration of available multiple access schemes to support diverse services and applications in future 5G networks.",

      "abstract": "The high energy consumption of network operators and mobile users has raised environmental, financial, and quality-of-experience concerns. These concerns have renewed the research efforts in developing green communication strategies for energy efficient wireless network operation. Network operators employ dynamic planning to save energy at low call traffic load by switching off some of their base stations (BSs), and mobile users are served by the remaining active BSs. The existing research investigates energy efficiency of dynamic planning approaches only from the network operator perspective. Dynamic planning, if not carefully designed, can lead to higher energy consumption for the mobile users in the uplink, which in turn degrades the uplink service quality due to mobile terminals' battery depletion. In this article we propose a dynamic planning framework with balanced energy efficiency that accounts for the energy consumption of the mobile users in the uplink as well as that of the network operators in the downlink. We discuss the associated challenges and implementation issues. A dynamic planning approach based on a multi-time scale decision process is proposed to achieve the balanced energy efficiency framework. Numerical results demonstrate the improved energy efficiency performance for the uplink mobile users as compared with the traditional dynamic planning approach.",

Though this kind of computation offloading benefits compute-intensive applications, the corresponding service models and analytics tools are remaining open issues. In this paper we categorize computation offloading into three modes: remote cloud service mode, connected ad hoc cloudlet service mode, and opportunistic ad hoc cloudlet service mode.

      "abstract": "The emergence of popular wireless technologies such as LTE and WiFi, and the exponential growth in the usage of these technologies, has led to extremely dense wireless networks. There are many proposals for coping with such densification. In particular, we evaluate the compound effect of inter-cell interference schemes and spectrum efficient intra-cell relay techniques, which have been individually proposed recently as separate solutions. We provide a jointly coordinated intracell and inter-cell resource allocation mechanism that opportunistically exploits network density as a resource. We show that intracell opportunistic relay, based on WiFi communications, reduces the complexity of Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) and boosts the efficiency of ICIC in LTE. The superiority of the proposed solution to the legacy cellular network operation is proven via simulations.",

      "abstract": "A range of applications in cognitive radio networks, from adaptive spectrum sensing to predictive spectrum mobility and dynamic spectrum access, depend on our ability to foresee the state evolution of radio spectrum, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is radio spectrum state (RSS) predictable? In this article we explore the fundamental limits of predictability in RSS dynamics by studying the RSS evolution patterns in spectrum bands of several popular services, including TV bands, ISM bands, cellular bands, and so on. From an information theory perspective, we introduce a methodology of using statistical entropy measures and Fano inequality to quantify the degree of predictability underlying real-world spectrum measurements. Despite the apparent randomness, we find a remarkable predictability, as large as 90 percent, in real-world RSS dynamics over a number of spectrum bands for all popular services. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of prediction-based spectrum sharing in 5G wireless communications.",

Such a solution could help car manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which wireless technology should be used for maximizing the benefits of IVWSNs is still an open issue. In this article we propose to use a new wireless technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and outline a new architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study that encompasses an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good performance and low-power, lowcomplexity, and low-cost attributes.",

      "abstract": "As a major supplement to LTE-Advanced, D2D communications underlaying cellular networks have proven efficient in offloading network infrastructures and improving network performance. The scheduling mechanism plays a key role in providing better user experience in D2D communications. However, controlled by operators, D2D communications pose specific problems that do not exist in available wireless networks. Therefore, mature scheduling mechanisms devised for cellular networks or ad hoc networks are not directly applicable to D2D communications. In this article, we first review recent research on scheduling mechanisms for D2D communications, and discuss the design considerations and implementation challenges. Then we propose an on-demand scheduling mechanism, DO-Fast, which can provide QoS differentiation capabilities. Next, we provide performance evaluations based on simulations and an experimental testbed. Finally, we conclude this article and point out possible directions for future research.",

      "abstract": "The growing popularity of cloud and multimedia services is dramatically increasing the traffic volume that each data center needs to handle. This is driving the demand for highly scalable, flexible, and energy-efficient networks inside data centers, in particular for the edge tier, which requires a large number of interconnects and consumes the dominant part of the overall power. Optical fiber communication is widely recognized as the highest energy- and cost-efficient technique to offer ultra-large capacity for telecommunication networks. It has also been considered as a promising transmission technology for future data center applications. Taking into account the characteristics of the traffic generated by the servers, such as locality, multicast, dynamicity, and burstiness, the emphasis of the research on data center networks has to be put on architectures that leverage optical transport to the greatest possible extent. However, no feasible solution based on optical switching is available so far for handling the data center traffic at the edge tier. Therefore, apart from conventional optical switching, we investigate a completely different paradigm, passive optical interconnects, and aim to explore the possibility for optical interconnects at the top of the rack. In this article, we present three major types of passive optical interconnects and carry out a performance assessment with respect to the ability to host data center traffic, scalability, optical power budget, complexity of the required interface, cost, and energy consumption. Our results have verified that the investigated passive optical interconnects can achieve a significant reduction of power consumption and maintain cost at a similar level compared to its electronic counterpart. Furthermore, several research directions on passive optical interconnects have been pointed out for future green data centers.",

      "abstract": "This article presents an efficient optical service chaining architecture for network function virtualization in data centers. Service chaining (i.e., steering traffic through a sequence of network functions) is one emerging application of software-defined networking. However, existing schemes steer traffic solely in the packet domain, which is well suited for fine-grained (e.g., peruser level) flows carrying a relatively small volume of traffic. This article discusses how packet-based schemes do not yield sufficient efficiency for large/aggregated flows steered through high-capacity core network functions. It introduces an optical steering domain into the operator's data centers for NFV service chaining at a coarse-grained traffic level using wavelength switching. Performance evaluation shows that the optical steering domain can achieve significant power savings compared to using packet technologies as flow rates and the number of vNFs per service chain grow.",

However, conventional OFDM has significant OOBE, which can cause severe interference to systems operating in adjacent frequency bands. In addition to conventional techniques such as spectral shaping filtering, guard band insertion, and time domain windowing, new OOBE reduction techniques, including cancellation carrier and spectral precoding, have been proposed in recent years. This article reviews various OOBE reduction techniques and proposes a generalized low-complexity OOBE reduction framework for discrete Fourier transform precoded OFDM. With the allocation of explicit frequency domain cancellation subcarriers and data domain cancellation symbols, the proposed framework enables various configurations to achieve significant OOBE reduction with low implementation complexity, and provides flexibility in balancing OOBE reduction and other performance metrics such as peak-to-average power ratio.",

Next, innovations in outphasing architecture, design, and implementation are given that overcome the difficulties related to the traditional outphasing configuration. Using the latest insights in drive schemes for input signals and quasi load-insensitive class-E output matching, very compact high-power high-performance digital- like transmitters are enabled that offer high efficiency and high spectral purity while being reconfigurable in their operating frequency.",

      "abstract": "With the extensive use of information technology in AAL communication systems, a data management model has recently embodied the 3-V characteristics of big data: volume, velocity, and variety. A lot of work has been done on volume and velocity, but not as much has been reported on variety. To handle the variety of data, universal solutions with acceptable performance are usually much more cost effective than customized solutions. To achieve universality, a basic idea is to first define a universal abstraction that covers a wide range of data types, and then build a universal system for universal abstraction. Traditional database management systems commonly use a multidimensional data type, or feature vectors, as a universal abstraction. However, many new data types in AAL systems cannot be abstracted into multidimensional space. To find a more universal data abstraction and build more universal systems, we propose the concept of big data abstraction, with metric space as a universal abstraction for AAL data types. Furthermore, to demonstrate how metricspace data abstraction works, we survey the state of the art in metric space indexing, a fundamental task in data management. Finally, open research issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Realistic mobility simulation is critical for evaluating the performance of communication networks. Although various mobility models exist, they do not capture the changes in the mobility decisions of pedestrians in specific environments. For instance, in the case of a natural or manmade disaster, the main goal is the safe evacuation of the area, creating unique pedestrian mobility patterns. In this article we focus on the scenario of evacuating a theme park in response to a disaster. We discuss the characteristics of theme parks, modeling the environment, and the mobility decisions of pedestrians. Real theme park maps are used for modeling the environment with roads, physical obstacles, and simulating disaster events. The mobility decisions of the pedestrians are based on the evacuation goal, the limited knowledge of the area, and the obstacles. The impact of the interactions between the crowd flows is modeled based on the concept of social force. The model is evaluated by comparison with the existing mobility models and the GPS traces of theme park visitors.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi networks are widely deployed for provision of Internet-centric data services. Since the inception of the Wi-Fi network in 1997 with its technical specification rooted in the IEEE 802.11 standard, much progress for higher data throughput has been made. Currently popular IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network in 2.4/5 GHz can deliver 600 Mb/s over a 40 MHz channel, which works well for most types of Internet-centric data services, and a later version of a Wi-Fi network based on IEEE 802.11ac is able to transmit at about 7 Gb/s. A simple configuration of a Wi-Fi network consisting of an AP and multiple stations for bidirectional data transmission enables low-cost implementation. High data rate provided at low cost as well as the abundance of Wi- Fi-capable mobile stations recently led to dense deployment of Wi-Fi networks, particularly in residential areas, business offices, and indoor/ outdoor hotspots. However, dense deployment of Wi-Fi networks (e.g., Wi-Fi DenseNets) causes significantly increased overall interference, and as a result a significantly lowered achievable data rate. Thus, it is sensible to consider technologies that can resolve or mitigate deteriorated throughput of Wi-Fi DenseNets. In this article, technologies to deal with throughput enhancement of Wi-Fi DenseNets are addressed from three different perspectives: exploiting cellular technology for data transmission, elevating spectral efficiency, and controlling overall interference levels. Evaluation of interference control for Wi-Fi DenseNets is carried out in this article, and it is found that significant per-node throughput enhancement can be achieved.",

Due to the communication and sensing capability of personal and wearable devices, their pervasive deployment and use may lead to an improvement of social and personal welfare by exploiting novel mobile citizen sensing systems. However, the pervasiveness of such large-scale sensing systems is only possible if devices are able to share sensing data independent of the available communication infrastructure, their location, and applications making use of the collected data. This article describes a set of paradigms that should be considered to build pervasive data sharing systems, and proposes a node architecture to implement them.",

      "abstract": "Physical layer key generation that exploits reciprocity and randomness of wireless fading channels has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. Although theoretical study has shown its potential to generate information- theoretic secure keys, great challenges remain when transforming the theory into practice. This article provides an overview of the physical layer key generation process and discusses its practical challenges. Different passive and active attacks are analyzed and evaluated through numerical study. A new key generation scheme using random probing signals, and combining user generated randomness and channel randomness, is introduced as a countermeasure against active attacks. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher security strength than existing schemes using constant probing signals under active attacks. Future research topics on physical layer key generation are discussed.",

Specifically, we first show that MaMIMO itself is robust against passive eavesdropping attacks. We then review a pilot contamination scheme that actively attacks the channel estimation process. This pilot contamination attack not only dramatically reduces the achievable secrecy capacity but is also difficult to detect. We proceed by reviewing some methods from literature that detect active attacks on MaMIMO. The last part of the article surveys the open research problems that we believe are the most important to address in the future and give a few promising directions of research to solve them.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative relaying is an effective method of increasing the range and reliability of wireless networks, and several relaying strategies have been adopted in major wireless standards. Recently, cooperative relaying has also been considered in the context of PHY security, which is a new security paradigm to supplement traditional cryptographic schemes that usually handle security at the upper layers. In wireless PHY security, relay nodes can be used to exploit the physical layer properties of wireless channels in order to support a secured transmission from a source to a destination in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers. While some breakthroughs have been made in this emerging research area, to date, the problem of how to effectively adopt advanced relaying protocols to enhance PHY security is still far from being fully understood. In this article, we present a comprehensive summary of current state-of-theart PHY security concepts in wireless relay networks. A case study is then provided to quantify the benefits of power allocation and relay location for enhanced security. We finally outline important future research directions in relaying topologies, full-duplex relaying, and cross-layer design that can ignite new interests and ideas on the topic.",

Its scientific payload is an experimental attitude control actuator that uses a diamagnetic material called pyrolytic graphite. We seek to demonstrate that this diamagnetic effect can be used to control the attitude of small satellites in Earth orbit, and thereby inspire research into developing materials with stronger diamagnetic properties and further their use in spacecraft control.",

      "abstract": "Over the last few years, the number of indoor localization solutions has grown exponentially, and a wide variety of different technologies and approaches are being explored. Unfortunately, there is currently no established standardized evaluation method for comparing their performance. As a result, each solution is evaluated in a different environment using proprietary evaluation metrics. Consequently, it is currently extremely hard to objectively compare the performance of multiple localization solutions with each other. To address the problem, we present the EVARILOS Benchmarking Platform, which enables automated evaluation and comparison of multiple solutions in different environments using multiple evaluation metrics. We propose a testbed-independent benchmarking platform, combined with multiple testbed-dependent plugins for executing experiments and storing performance results. The platform implements the standardized evaluation method described in the EVARILOS Benchmarking Handbook, which is aligned with the upcoming ISO/IEC 18305 standard \u201cTest and Evaluation of Localization and Tracking Systems.\u201d The platform and plug-ins can be used in real time on existing wireless testbed facilities, while also supporting a remote offline evaluation method using precollected data traces. Using these facilities, and analyzing and comparing the performance of three different localization solutions, we demonstrate the need for objective evaluation methods that consider multiple evaluation criteria in different environments.",

      "abstract": "Cost-effective and scalable wireless backhaul solutions are essential for realizing the 5G vision of providing gigabits per second anywhere. Not only is wireless backhaul essential to support network densification based on small cell deployments, but also for supporting very low latency inter-BS communication to deal with intercell interference. Multiplexing backhaul and access on the same frequency band (in-band wireless backhaul) has obvious cost benefits from the hardware and frequency reuse perspective, but poses significant technology challenges. We consider an in-band solution to meet the backhaul and inter-BS coordination challenges that accompany network densification. Here, we present an analysis to persuade the readers of the feasibility of in-band wireless backhaul, discuss realistic deployment and system assumptions, and present a scheduling scheme for inter- BS communications that can be used as a baseline for further improvement. We show that an inband wireless backhaul for data backhauling and inter-BS coordination is feasible without significantly hurting the cell access capacities.",

In this article we explore a future scenario in which low power networking is no longer optional, but instead becomes a necessity due to fluctuating energy availability. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we argue why a so called post-peak future scenario, in which we can no longer rely on fossil fuels as our main resource for electricity production, is not unlikely, and what it might entail. Second, we explore the consequences of such a scenario for ICT: How well can current and future infrastructures cope with temporary energy limitations? As an illustration, we present a case study showing the impact of reduced energy availability on a wireless access network.",

In this article we identify the challenges on two important issues for a successful people-centric sensing system, i.e., privacy and incentives, because if either there is no incentive to participate or participants' privacy is invaded, smartphone owners will be reluctant to participate. Then we review some recent works that address these two issues. Finally, we suggest directions for future work on people-centric sensing by describing several open issues.",

However, users have concerns regarding possible privacy leakage from their data and lack incentives to contribute their data. To effectively motivate users to participate, both privacy and incentive issues need to be addressed. In this article, we address how to simultaneously protect privacy and provide incentives for participatory sensing. We review previous approaches, discuss their limitations, and propose new approaches for two types of participatory sensing systems.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we present a real-time full duplex radio system for 5G wireless networks. Full duplex radios are capable of opening new possibilities in contexts of high traffic demand where there are limited radio resources. A critical issue, however, in implementing full duplex radios in real wireless environments is being able to cancel self-interference. To overcome the selfinterference challenge, we prototype our design on a software-defined radio platform. This design combines a dual-polarization antenna-based analog part with a digital self-interference canceler that operates in real time. Prototype test results confirm that the proposed full duplex system achieves about 1.9 times higher throughput than a half duplex system. This article concludes with a discussion of implementation challenges that remain for researchers seeking the most viable solution for full duplex communications.",

Therefore, there exist combined efforts to also provide wireless access on high speed trains (HSTs), in order to add to the attractiveness of this means of transportation. Installing an additional relay on the train, to facilitate communication, is an approach that has already been extensively discussed in the literature. The possibility of a direct communication between the base station and the passenger has been neglected until now, despite it having numerous advantages. Therefore, a comparison between these two opposing approaches is presented in this article, accompanied by a detailed discussion of the related aspects. Additionally, we present simulation results for the two approaches when applying different schemes to supply a wireless connection. We also discuss the presented results from the perspectives of mobile operators and train operators.",

      "abstract": "Energy harvesting (EH) is an innovative way to build long-term and self-sustainable wireless networks. However, an inconstant EH rate may have an adverse effect on the quality-of-service (QoS) of wireless traffic, such as packet delay and error. In this article we discuss techniques that provide QoS to EH powered wireless communications. A new \"dynamic string tautening\" method is presented to produce the most energy efficient schedule with substantially lower complexity, compared to convex optimization techniques. The method adapts to the bursty arrivals of wireless traffic and harvested energy, and ensures that delay-sensitive data will be delivered by deadline. Comprehensive designs of EH powered transmitters are also discussed, where the EH rate, battery capacity, and deadline requirement can be jointly adjusted to leverage QoS and the cost.",

      "abstract": "Telecom operators have recently faced the need for a radical shift from technical quality requirements to customer experience guarantees. This trend has emerged due to the constantly increasing amount of mobile devices and applications and the explosion of overall traffic demand, forming a new era: \u201cthe rise of the consumer\u201d. New terms have been coined in order to quantify, manage, and improve the experienced user quality, with QoE being the most dominant one. However, QoE has always been an afterthought for network providers, and thus numerous research questions need to be answered prior to a shift from conventional network-centric paradigms to more user-centric approaches. To this end, the scope of this article is to provide insights on the issue of network-level QoE management, identifying the open issues and prerequisites toward acquiring QoE awareness and enabling QoE support in mobile cellular networks. A conceptual framework for achieving end-to-end QoE provisioning is proposed and described in detail in terms of its design, its constituents and their interactions, as well as the key implementation challenges. An evaluation study serves as a proof of concept for this framework, and demonstrates the potential benefits of implementing such a quality management scheme on top of current or future generations of mobile cellular networks.",

The unique nature of QKD ensures that eavesdropping on quantum communications necessarily introduces detectable errors which is desirable for high-security environments. QKD systems have been demonstrated in both freespace and optical fiber configurations, gaining global interest from national laboratories, commercial entities, and the U.S. Department of Defense. However, QKD is a nascent technology where realized systems are constructed from non-ideal components, which can significantly impact system performance and security. In this article, we describe QKD technology as part of a secure communications solution and identify vulnerabilities associated with practical network architectures. In particular, we examine the performance of decoy state enabled QKD systems against a modeled photon number splitting attack and suggest an improvement to the decoy state protocol security condition that does not assume a priori knowledge of the QKD channel efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for spectral- and energy-efficient communication networks has spurred great interest in energy harvesting cognitive radio networks. Such a revolutionary technology represents a paradigm shift in the development of wireless networks, as it can simultaneously enable the efficient use of the available spectrum and the exploitation of RF energy in order to reduce reliance on traditional energy sources. This is mainly triggered by the recent advancements in microelectronics that puts forward RF energy harvesting as a plausible technique in the near future. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the operation of a network relying on harvested energy needs to be redesigned to allow the network to reliably function in the long term. To this end, the aim of this survey article is to provide a comprehensive overview of recent development and the challenges regarding the operation of CRNs powered by RF energy. In addition, the potential open issues that might be considered for future research are also discussed in this article.",

      "abstract": "With the formidable growth of various booming wireless communication services that require ever increasing data throughputs, the conventional microwave band below 10 GHz, which is currently used by almost all mobile communication systems, is going to reach its saturation point within just a few years. Therefore, the attention of radio system designers has been pushed toward ever higher segments of the frequency spectrum in a quest for increased capacity. In this article we investigate the feasibility, advantages, and challenges of future wireless communications over the Eband frequencies. We start with a brief review of the history of the E-band spectrum and its light licensing policy as well as benefits/challenges. Then we introduce the propagation characteristics of E-band signals, based on which some potential fixed and mobile applications at the E-band are investigated. In particular, we analyze the achievability of a nontrivial multiplexing gain in fixed point-to-point E-band links, and propose an E-band mobile broadband (EMB) system as a candidate for the next generation mobile communication networks. The channelization and frame structure of the EMB system are discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "The majority of the work on underwater communication has mainly been based on acoustic communication. Acoustic communication faces many known problems, such as high propagation delays, very low data rates, and highly environment-dependent channel behavior. In this article, to address these shortcomings, magnetic induction is introduced as a possible communication paradigm for underwater applications. Accordingly, all research challenges in this regard are explained. Fundamentally different from the conventional underwater communication paradigm, which relies on EM, acoustic, or optical waves, the underwater MI communications rely on the time varying magnetic field to covey information between the transmitting and receiving parties. MI-based underwater communications exhibit several unique and promising features such as negligible signal propagation delay, predictable and constant channel behavior, sufficiently long communication range with high bandwidth, as well as silent and stealth underwater operations. To fully utilize the promising features of underwater MI-based communications, this article introduces the fundamentals of underwater MI communications, including the MI channel models, MI networking protocols design, and MI-based underwater localization.",

In order to deploy such full-duplex relays, it is necessary to efficiently mitigate the inherent self-interference stemming from the strong transmit signal coupling to the sensitive receive chain. In this article, we present novel state-of-the-art antenna solutions as well as digital self-interference cancellation algorithms for compact MIMO fullduplex relays, specifically targeted for reduced-cost deployments in local area networks. The presented antenna design builds on resonant wavetraps and is shown to provide passive isolations on the order of 60\u201370 dB. We also discuss and present advanced digital cancellation solutions, beyond classical linear processing, specifically tailored against nonlinear distortion of the power amplifier when operating close to saturation. Measured results from a complete demonstrator system, integrating antennas, RF cancellation, and nonlinear digital cancellation, are also presented, evidencing close to 100 dB of overall self-interference suppression. The reported results indicate that building and deploying compact full-duplex MIMO relays is already technologically feasible.",

      "abstract": "AAL technologies constitute a new paradigm that promises quality of life enhancements in chronic care patients and elderly people. From a communication perspective, they involve heterogeneous deployments of body and ambient sensors in complex multihop topologies. Such networks can significantly benefit from the application of cooperative schemes based on network coding, where random linear combinations of the original data packets are transmitted in order to exploit diversity. Nevertheless, network coordination is sometimes required to obtain the full potential of these schemes, especially in the presence of channel errors, requiring the design of efficient, reliable, and versatile MAC protocols. Motivated by the recent advances in cloud computing, we investigate the possibility of transferring the network coordination to the cloud while maintaining the data exchange and storage at a local data plane. Hence, we design a general framework for the development of cloudassisted protocols for AAL applications and propose a high-performance and error-resilient MAC scheme with cloud capabilities.",

Reliable and highly efficient vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are essential for commercial autonomous driving vehicles to be on the road before 2020. The current article first presents the concept of heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNETs) for autonomous driving, in which an improved protocol stack is proposed to satisfy the communication requirements of not only safety but also non-safety services. We then consider and study in detail several typical scenarios for autonomous driving. In order to tackle the potential challenges raised by the autonomous driving vehicles in HetVNETs, new techniques from transmission to networking are proposed as potential solutions.",

The major shortcomings of current fronthaul solutions are first analyzed, and then a new fronthaul interface called next-generation fronthaul interface (NGFI) is proposed. The design principles for NGFI are presented, including decoupling the fronthaul bandwidth from the number of antennas, decoupling cell and user equipment processing, and focusing on high-performancegain collaborative technologies. NGFI aims to better support key 5G technologies, in particular cloud RAN, network functions virtualization, and large-scale antenna systems. NGFI claims the advantages of reduced bandwidth as well as improved transmission efficiency by exploiting the tidal wave effect on mobile network traffic. The transmission of NGFI is based on Ethernet to enjoy the benefits of flexibility and reliability. The major impact, challenges, and potential solutions of Ethernet-based fronthaul networks are also analyzed. Jitter, latency, and time and frequency synchronization are the major issues to overcome.",

      "abstract": "Recently, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have emerged as a promising networking technique for various underwater applications. An energy efficient routing protocol plays a vital role in data transmission and practical applications. However, due to the specific characteristics of UWSNs, such as dynamic structure, narrow bandwidth, rapid energy consumption, and high latency, it is difficult to build routing protocols for UWSNs. In this article we focus on surveying existing routing protocols in UWSNs. First, we classify existing routing protocols into two categories based on a route decision maker. Then the performance of existing routing protocols is compared in detail. Furthermore, future research issues of routing protocols in UWSNs are carefully analyzed.",

SCALE uses novel networking technologies, commodity sensor devices, cloud services, and middleware abstractions to sense, analyze, and act on sensed events in a distributed manner. It monitors environmental factors (i.e. smoke, explosive gas) and automatically alerts residents via phone upon discovery of a possible emergency, enabling them to confirm the event and contact emergency dispatchers with minimal effort. This article describes the inception, design, development, and deployment of a prototype system to achieve these goals.

      "abstract": "As a joint initiative of WHO and ITU, mHealth is becoming a feasible tool to offer data-intensive healthcare services online. In general, each kind of mHealth application has user-specific service-quality requirements that could be satisfied in the cost of bandwidth overconsumption. In any mobile network, bandwidth overconsumption is selfishly competing with limited radio resources. This phenomenon is further magnified by the \u201cbest-effort\u201d service pattern inherited from IP networking, and the influence from interference, fading, and other mobility effects on unreliable radio channels. To enrich mHealth applications, we propose a Service-Mapping Adaptive Radio Transmission (SMART) scheduling algorithm, in which system parameters (QCI, CQI, MCS in AMC, etc.) are employed to enable \u201cbetter than best effort\u201d packet-switching services in full-IP mobile networks (e.g. LTE/LTE-Advanced). In this proposal, the designed scheduling metric is a self-adaptive mechanism that can combine mobile service-quality inspection and transmission pattern recognition dynamically. System-level simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposal can obtain approximately 31.25 percent gain on average, in contrast to existing solutions. Additionally, the runtime complexity of this solution is lowered to O(K log K), where K is the number of mHealth users within a cell.",

This article examines security, a pivotal issue in the 5G network where wireless transmissions are inherently vulnerable to security breaches. Specifically, we focus on physical layer security, which safeguards data confidentiality by exploiting the intrinsic randomness of the communications medium and reaping the benefits offered by the disruptive technologies to 5G. Among various technologies, the three most promising ones are discussed: heterogenous networks, massive multiple-input multiple-output, and millimeter wave. On the basis of the key principles of each technology, we identify the rich opportunities and the outstanding challenges that security designers must tackle. Such an identification is expected to decisively advance the understanding of future physical layer security.",

      "abstract": "In modern lighting systems, the introduction of wirelessly controlled LED light sources leads to very dense wireless lighting networks. Current approaches for control message transmission are based on broadcasting messages among many luminaires. However, adequate communication performance - in particular, sufficiently low latency and synchronicity - is difficult to ensure in such networks, especially if the network is part of a wireless building management system and carries not only low-latency broadcast messages but also collects data from sensors. This article describes the challenge of dense wireless lighting control networks. In particular, it discusses the underlying mechanisms and refers to current wireless sensor network solutions in which scalability is relevant.",

In this article, we describe various passive (traffic analysis) and active (jamming) attacks that are facilitated by SCI. Our goal is to highlight the need for novel PHY-layer security techniques that can be used to complement classical encryption methods. We discuss several of these techniques along with advanced hardware that exhibits promising capabilities for countering privacy and SCI-related attacks.",

      "abstract": "UASNs are widely used in many applications, and many studies have been conducted. However, most current research projects have not taken network security into consideration, despite the fact that a UASN is typically vulnerable to malicious attacks due to the unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic communication channel (e.g., low communication bandwidth, long propagation delays, and high bit error rates). In addition, the significant differences between UASNs and terrestrial wireless sensor networks entail the urgent and rapid development of secure communication mechanisms for underwater sensor nodes. For the above mentioned reasons, this article aims to present a somewhat comprehensive survey of the emerging topics arising from secure communications in UASNs, which naturally lead to a great number of open research issues outlined afterward.",

We first review a range of physical-layer attacks in CR networks, including primary user emulation, sensing falsification, intelligence compromise, jamming, and eavesdropping attacks. Then we focus on the physical-layer security of CR networks against eavesdropping and examine the secrecy performance of cognitive communications in terms of secrecy outage probability. We further consider the use of relays for improving CR security against eavesdropping and propose an opportunistic relaying scheme, where a relay node that makes CR communications most resistant to eavesdropping is chosen to participate in assisting the transmission from a cognitive source to its destination. It is illustrated that the physical- layer secrecy of CR communications relying on opportunistic relaying can be significantly improved by increasing the number of relays, showing the security benefit of exploiting relay nodes. Finally, we present some open challenges in the field of relay-assisted physical-layer security for CR networks.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of SDNs promises to dramatically simplify network management and enable innovation through network programmability. Despite all the hype surrounding SDNs, exploiting its full potential is demanding. Security is still the key concern and is an equally striking challenge that reduces the growth of SDNs. Moreover, the deployment of novel entities and the introduction of several architectural components of SDNs pose new security threats and vulnerabilities. Besides, the landscape of digital threats and cyber-attacks is evolving tremendously, considering SDNs as a potential target to have even more devastating effects than using simple networks. Security is not considered as part of the initial SDN design; therefore, it must be raised on the agenda. This article discusses the state-of-the-art security solutions proposed to secure SDNs. We classify the security solutions in the literature by presenting a thematic taxonomy based on SDN layers/interfaces, security measures, simulation environments, and security objectives. Moreover, the article points out the possible attacks and threat vectors targeting different layers/interfaces of SDNs. The potential requirements and their key enablers for securing SDNs are also identified and presented. Also, the article gives great guidance for secure and dependable SDNs. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges of SDN security that may be deemed appropriate to be tackled by researchers and professionals in the future.",

      "abstract": "Underwater sensor networks are envisioned to enable a wide range of underwater applications such as pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, and oil/gas spill monitoring. Such applications require precise location information as otherwise the sensed data might be meaningless. On the other hand, security and privacy are critical issues as underwater sensor networks are typically deployed in harsh environments. Nevertheless, most underwater localization schemes are vulnerable to many attacks and suffer from potential privacy violations as they are designed for benign environments. However, a localization scheme that does not consider security and privacy could lead to serious consequences, especially in critical applications such as military monitoring. In this article, we discuss the security and privacy issues in underwater localization, and investigate the techniques that can provide security and preserve node privacy in underwater sensor networks.",

However, it also raises some critical security and privacy issues that impede the application of MCNs. In this article, in order to better understand these critical security and privacy challenges, we first propose a general architecture for a mobile crowdsourcing network comprising both crowdsourcing sensing and crowdsourcing computing. After that, we set forth several critical security and privacy challenges that essentially capture the characteristics of MCNs. We also formulate some research problems leading to possible research directions. We expect this work will bring more attention to further investigation on security and privacy solutions for mobile crowdsourcing networks.",

Space information networks are able to enhance detection and transmission capabilities compared to the current single Earth observation satellite. Although lots of technical work has been done concerning the space network architecture and protocols, the security issues have not been investigated well. In this article, we focus on the security problems in space information networks from four perspectives, that is, secure handoff, secure transmission control, key management, and secure routing. Existing works, together with their challenges and open problems, are discussed, and our proposed scheme is introduced. Overall, this article aims to help readers understand the motivation, problem formulation, and solutions regarding security issues on space information networks.",

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles capable of navigating unpredictable real-world environments with little human feedback are a reality today. Such systems rely heavily on onboard sensors such as cameras, radar/LIDAR, and GPS as well as capabilities such as 3G/4G connectivity and V2V/V2I communication to make real-time maneuvering decisions. Autonomous vehicle control imposes very strict requirements on the security of the communication channels used by the vehicle to exchange information as well as the control logic that performs complex driving tasks such as adapting vehicle velocity or changing lanes. This study presents a first look at the effects of security attacks on the communication channel as well as sensor tampering of a connected vehicle stream equipped to achieve CACC. Our simulation results show that an insider attack can cause significant instability in the CACC vehicle stream. We also illustrate how different countermeasures, such as downgrading to ACC mode, could potentially be used to improve the security and safety of the connected vehicle streams.",

      "abstract": "Software-defined wireless networking (SDWN) is an emerging paradigm in the era of the Internet of Things. In cloud-based SDWNs, resource management is seperated from the geo-distributed cloud, forming a virtual network topology in the control plane. Thus, a centralized software program is able to control and program the behavior of the entire network. In this article, we focus on resource management in cloud-based SDWNs, and discuss the competition and cooperation between cloud service providers. We present a Nash bargaining game approach to process the resource trading activity among cloud service providers in cloud-based SDWNs. Utility functions have been specifically considered to incorporate operation cost and resource utilization. Illustrative results indicate that cooperation is able to generate more benefits than competition. Moreover, resource sharing among cloud service providers has great significance in efficiently utilizing limited resources and improving quality of service.",

Unlike other harvesting techniques that depend on the environment, RFH can be predictable or on demand, and as such it is better suited for supporting quality-of-service-based applications. However, RFH efficiency is scarce due to low RF-to-DC conversion efficiency and receiver sensitivity. In this article, we identify the novel communication techniques that enable and enhance the usefulness of RFH. Backed by some experimental observations on RFH and the current state of the art, we discuss the challenges in the actual feasibility of RFH communications, new research directions, and the obstacles to their practical implementation.",

      "abstract": "Recently, patients suffering from a set of physical and mental limitations, called co-morbidities, are often treated at home. In this environment, modern communication systems represent a great support to implement Ambient Assisted Living platforms aimed at monitoring patients at home because they enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous sensing units, medical devices, and ubiquitous access to data. This article describes a specific smartphone-centric architecture where smartphones are employed not only as hubs of the health information but also as sensing, processing, and transmitting devices. Smartphones have both short-range (Bluetooth and WiFi employed for local information exchange) and long-range (GPRS, 3G/4G, and WiFi employed as Internet access) communication capabilities; information processing capabilities offered by modern platforms often equipped with different CPUs and with flexible and efficient software; and sensing capabilities implemented through sensors embedded into smartphones such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, microphones, and radio interfaces or through external sensors added to smartphones by cables or connected through local radio interfaces. The specific case of co-morbidities considered in this article implies the necessity to acquire a heterogeneous set of data from patients and from their environment. For this reason this article highlights the information processing capabilities of the introduced smartphone-centric platform. Audio, localization, and movement information processing have been evidenced as well as the specific implementations of these capabilities and their performance.",

We present an organized social graphical view on resource allocation and then extend to multi-objective resource allocation of wireless networks. We subsequently consider taking advantage of multi-dimensional resources, including radio resource, user behavior, and content characteristics, such that we can successfully integrate caching capability, interest similarity, and content popularity and distribution into wireless network design. As an illustration, device-to-device communications is utilized to form pairs and clusters of mobile devices regarding optimal resource matching via a bipartite graph. This socially enabled methodology highlights new potential to design wireless networks and 5G mobile communications.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a brief overview on the current development of software-defined mobile networks (SDMNs). Software defined networking is seen as a promising technology to manage the complexity in communication networks. The need for SDMN comes from the complexity of network management in 5G mobile networks and beyond, driven by increasing mobile traffic demand, heterogeneous wireless environments, and diverse service requirements. The need is strong to introduce new radio network architecture by taking advantage of software oriented design, the separation of the data and control planes, and network virtualization to manage complexity and offer flexibility in 5G networks. Clearly, software oriented design in mobile networks will be fundamentally different from SDN for the Internet, because mobile networks deal with the wireless access problem in complex radio environments, while the Internet mainly addresses the packet forwarding problem. Specific requirements in mobile networks shape the development of SDMN. In this article we present the needs and requirements of SDMN, with particular focus on the software-defined design for radio access networks. We analyze the fundamental problems in radio access networks that call for SDN design and present an SDMN concept. We give a brief overview on current solutions for SDMN and standardization activities. We argue that although SDN design is currently focusing on mobile core networks, extending SDN to radio access networks would naturally be the next step. We identify several research directions on SDN for radio access networks and expect more fundamental studies to release the full potential of software-defined 5G networks.",

Recently, new satellite technologies have been pushed to the market enabling high-performance satellite access networks. On the other hand, network architectures are taking advantage of emerging technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network virtualization and network functions virtualization (NFV). Therefore, benefiting communications services over satellite networks from these new technologies at first, and their seamless integration with terrestrial networks at second, are of great interest and importance. In this paper, and through comprehensive use cases, the advantages of introducing network programmability and virtualization using SDN and/or NFV in satellite networks are investigated. The requirements to be fulfilled in each use case are also discussed.",

The obligatory continuation of legacy services in their respective legacy networks consistently incurs OPEX. In this situation, we argue that network operators can benefit from the recent advances in SDN and NFV. This article introduces a blueprint for designing a novel network architecture that integrates legacy network services into 4G networks through SDN/NFV's software-based characteristics. In addition, our architecture reduces time to market for employing newly emerging services without mandating any changes in 4G infrastructures.",

Joseph Mitola deserves credit for formalizing and conceptualizing this evolution. We do not define software radio. Rather, we look at software radio from different perspectives. New equipments include more and more software radio \u201ccapacities,\u201d that is, they can be reconfigured thanks to software. Certain former analog functionalities are now performed digitally. We think that the timeframe during which software radio is advantageous, compared to a velcro1 approach for multi-standard terminals, is probably over. However, software radio has taken concrete form in the military field. We show that software radio is used de facto in all equipment and products because of the technological progress to which it has led. Software radio's legacy indeed is that it has been and still is a catalyst for wireless innovation. We conclude by showing that software radio will be used to its full potential when it is the support technology for other more complex fields such as cognitive radio.",

In this regard, SDN and NFV technologies have gained great momentum among the teleos, with the promise of interoperability, programmability, and on-demand dynamic provisioning. In this article, we present work being developed in the Mobile Packet Core project within the ONF Wireless &amp; Mobile Working Group regarding SDN architecture for the Mobile Packet Core. In addition, we propose an SDN-based MPC in the NFV context in order to facilitate dynamic provisioning of MPC network functions. Finally, a potential control architecture considering both SDN and NFV is proposed.",

      "abstract": "With more people living in cities, urban sensing is urgently required to create a comfortable and convenient living environment. As Internet of Things (IoT) is the fundamental infrastructure to realize urban sensing, it should be flexible to support various application requirements and convenient management of infrastructure. Inspired by software-defined networking, which aims to make networks more flexible, the authors propose a software-defined IoT architecture for smart urban sensing. This architecture decouples urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. Centralized controllers are designed to manage physical devices and provide APIs of data acquisition, transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. With these properties, various applications can coexist on the shared infrastructure, and each application can request controllers to customize its data acquisition, transmission, and processing on-demand by generating specific configurations of physical devices. This article discusses the background, benefits, and design details of the proposed architecture as well as open problems and potential solutions to realize it, which opens a new research direction for IoT and urban sensing.",

      "abstract": "Software-defined networking has brought both performance and management benefits to wired networks. It is natural to wonder if SDN principles also apply and can deliver similar benefits to RANs. It is this question that we intend to address in this article. We first highlight that the core SDN principle of decoupling control and data planes already exists in RANs in the form of self-organizing networking solutions, which can optimize RAN performance at coarse timescales. In addition to control/data plane separation, we also elaborate how fine timescale optimizations such as coordinated multi-point transmission are made practical with the help of cloud RANs (C-RANS), which offer the notion of processing decoupled from transmission within the data plane. We finally discuss the potential and challenges related to a less explored application of SDN in the RAN, which is programming the fronthaul network in a C-RAN. We argue that this novel notion of software-defined fronthaul, SDF, has the power to orchestrate novel applications and thus should be a key area of focus in RAN optimization.",

      "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that decouples the forwarding and control planes, traditionally coupled with one another, while adopting a logically centralized architecture aiming to increase network agility and programability. While many efforts are currently being made to standardize this emerging paradigm, careful attention needs to be paid to security at this early design stage too, rather than waiting until the technology becomes mature, thereby potentially avoiding previous pitfalls made when designing the Internet in the 1980s. This article focuses on the security aspects of SDN networks. We begin by discussing the new security advantages that SDN brings and by showing how some of the long-lasting issues in network security can be addressed by exploiting SDN capabilities. Then we describe the new security threats that SDN is faced with and discuss possible techniques that can be used to prevent and mitigate such threats.",

We first review current SDR-based architectures for underwater acoustic communications. Then we describe the architecture of a new software-defined acoustic modem prototype, and provide performance evaluation results in both indoor (water tank) and outdoor (lake) environments. We present three experimental testbed scenarios that demonstrate the real-time reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed prototype and show that it exhibits favorable characteristics toward spectrally efficient cognitive underwater networks, and high data rate underwater acoustic links. Finally, we discuss open research challenges for the implementation of next-generation software-defined underwater acoustic networks.",

      "abstract": "Harvesting energy from natural (solar, wind, vibration, etc.) and synthesized (microwave power transfer) sources is envisioned as a key enabler for realizing green wireless networks. Energy efficient scheduling is one of the prime objectives in emerging cognitive radio platforms. To that end, in this article we present a comprehensive framework to characterize the performance of a cognitive metro-cellular network empowered by solar energy harvesting. The proposed model allows designers to capture both the spatial and temporal dynamics of the energy field and the mobile user traffic. A new definition for the \u201cenergy outage probability\u201d metric, which characterizes the self-sustainable operation of the base stations under energy harvesting, is proposed, and the process for quantifying is described with the help of a case study for various UK cities. It is shown that the energy outage probability is strongly coupled with the path-loss exponent, required quality of service, and base station and user density. Moreover, the energy outage probability varies both on a daily and yearly basis depending on the solar geometry. It is observed that even in winter, BSs can run for three to six hours without any purchase of energy from the power grid by harvesting instantaneous energy.",

While state-of-the-art systems deliver robust ranging performance, the computational intensiveness of their detection mechanism expedites the energy depletion of the associated devices that are typically powered by batteries. The contribution of this article is fourfold. First, it outlines the common factors that are important for ranging. Second, it presents a review of acoustic rangers and identifies their potential problems. Third, it explores the design of an information processing framework based on sparse representation that could potentially address existing challenges, especially for mobile devices.

      "abstract": "To tackle the 1000\u00d7 mobile data challenge, the research towards the 5th generation of mobile cellular networks is currently ongoing. One clear enabler toward substantially improved network area capacities is the increasing level of network densification at different layers of the overall heterogeneous radio access system. Ultra-dense deployments, or DenseNets, seek to take network densification to a whole new level, where extreme spatial reuse is deployed. This article looks into DenseNets from the perspectives of different deployment strategies, covering the densification of the classical macro layer, extremely dense indoor femto layer, as well as outdoor distributed antenna system (DAS), which can be dynamically configured as a single microcell or multiple independent microcells. Also, the potential of a new indoor-to-outdoor service provisioning paradigm is examined. The different deployment solutions are analyzed from the network area spectral and network energy efficiency perspectives, with extreme densification levels, including both indoor and outdoor use scenarios. The obtained results indicate that dedicated indoor solutions with densely deployed femtocells are much more spectrumand energy-efficient approaches to address the enormous indoor capacity demands compared to densifying the outdoor macro layer, when the systems are pushed to their capacity limits. Furthermore, the dynamic outdoor DAS concept offers an efficient and capacity-adaptive solution to provide outdoor capacity, on demand, in urban areas.",

Additionally, the adoption of the space dimension is identified as a promising solution for the capacity expansion of future networks, while novel spatial-spectral switching solutions show that the flexible networking concept can be further expanded over both the spatial and spectral dimensions. This article provides an overview of the latest developments and possible approaches with respect to flexible optical networking and the emerging benefits that spatially flexible networking approaches can offer. The focus is on the network planning and resource optimization functions, the main network operations related to fragmentation and IP/optical layer integration, and the control plane solutions.",

      "abstract": "As a part of the global effort to address the overwhelming demand for wireless broadband capacity, the wireless communities in the United States have undertaken innovative initiatives such as tiered-access to shared spectrum. The Federal Communications Commission has proposed a dynamic spectrum management framework for a Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) governed by a spectrum access system (SAS). The implementation of a SAS capable of dynamic frequency assignment and interference management is critical for the success of the proposed framework. In this paper we present the efforts toward a spectrum sharing system in the U.S. context by summarizing different interest groups' standpoint on the FCC proposed framework. We also present an example SAS architecture that accommodates the tiered access to shared spectrum and example approaches to achieve important SAS capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Actuated sensor networks enabled by underwater acoustic communications can be efficiently used to sense over large marine expanses that are typically challenged by a paucity of resources (energy, communication bandwidth, number of sensor nodes). Many marine phenomena of interest admit sparse representations, which, coupled with actuation and cooperation, can compensate for being data starved. Herein, new methods of field reconstruction, target tracking, and exploration-exploitation are provided, which adopt sparse approximation, compressed sensing, and matrix completion algorithms. The needed underlying structure (sparsity/low-rank) is quite general. The unique constraints posed by underwater acoustic communications and vehicle kinematics are explicitly considered. Results show that solutions can be practically implemented, even over large ocean spaces.",

      "abstract": "Over the last few decades, network traffic has consistently grown at an exponential rate and was efficiently satisfied using WDM and more efficient coding schemes requiring coherent detection. There is no indication that the network traffic growth trend will cease anytime soon, and we are nearing the day when the capacity of the ubiquitous single-mode fiber will be fully exploited. Space-domain multiplexing (SDM) for high-capacity transmission is the promising solution with the scaling potential to meet future capacity demands. However, there is still a large technological gap between current WDM optical communication system designs and SDM network implementations. In this article we lay the foundation of switching node designs for future WDM-SDM optical networks.",

      "abstract": "Terahertz, sandwiched between conventional microwave and optical frequencies, has inspired increasing interest due to its uniqueness and high potential applications, such as imaging, sensing, and communications. This article, on the other hand, focuses on one emerging application of the terahertz spectrum: THz interconnect. Intra-/inter-chip communication has doubled every two years over recent decades, and the trend is projected to continue in the future. However, the bandwidth supportable by chip I/O pins cannot keep up with the requirement, which forms the increasing gap between the bandwidth requirement and support capability, or the interconnect gap. To ultimately solve the problem and close the gap, both bandwidth density and energy efficiency should be boosted. THz interconnect holds high potential to boost key performance by leveraging the advantages of both high-speed electronics devices and low-loss quasi-optical channels. This article discusses THz interconnect from different aspects: system architecture, circuit specifications, design challenges, and non-ideality effects. Particularly, this article exemplifies both active and passive circuit design techniques for THz interconnect, a 140 GHz transceiver and a terahertz generator in 65 nm CMOS technology, and a low-loss and process- compatible silicon waveguide channel. THz interconnect opens high potential new revenue to solve the long-standing interconnect issue.",

This paper narrates the history of the Telecommunication Engineering Education (TEE) initiative and movement (2008\u20132014) which resulted in recognition of this field as a distinct engineering education discipline in the US and 28 other countries. We describe how the case for this recognition was made successfully, based on advances in network science and engineering. We discuss some aspects of the new ABET criteria, and how they relate to ongoing and anticipated changes in the arena of engineering education.",

The satellite, once deployed, will test the properties of a self-healing carbon composite by performing a three-point bending test in space, and thereby assess its viability for use in space applications. The engineering model of the satellite payload met all CSDC testing requirements and placed second in the competition. Space Concordia now aims to expand and refine Aleksandr to participate in the upcoming CSDC.",

      "abstract": "The maturity of the telecommunications market and the fact that user demands increase every day leaves network operators no option but to deploy high-speed infrastructures and test them in an efficient and economical manner. A common approach to this problem has been the storage of network traffic samples for analysis and replay using different versions of what we have named NTSS. This type of task is particularly demanding in 10 Gb Ethernet links and has traditionally been addressed by closed solutions or NTSS built on top of high-end hardware. However, these approaches lack flexibility and extensibility, which typically translates into higher cost. This work studies how NTSS can be built using COTS: a combination of commodity hardware and open source software. To this end, we present the current limitations of COTS systems and focus on low-level optimization techniques at several levels: the NIC driver, hard drives, and the software interaction between them. The application of these techniques has proven crucial for reaching 10 Gb/s rates, as different state-of-the-art systems have shown after an extensive performance test.",

The ultimate goal of standardizing the MD architecture is to resolve the problem of portability between the radio application codes and hardware platforms of MDs. First, this article introduces key components of the standard architecture. Then the related interfaces that allow interaction of the key components with one another are shown. In addition, this article also shows how the radio application codes can be distributed from a public domain to target MDs when the codes are given in platform-specific executable code, platform- independent source code, or platformindependent intermediate representation with a consideration of both static and dynamic linking of functional blocks of each radio application code. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed standard architecture and related interfaces, this article shows sample procedures of data transfer communication service performed in an MD adopting the standard architecture.",

Although the community has made progress in understanding how the physical layer can support confidentiality and authentication, it is important to realize that there are many important issues that must be addressed if physical layer security is ever to be adopted by real and practical security systems. In this article, I briefly review several different flavors of physical layer security (at least for wireless systems), and then identify aspects (a.k.a. weaknesses) where the foundation for physical layer security needs to be strengthened. I then highlight that the opportunities for applying physical layer security to real systems will be quite rich if the community can overcome these challenges. In the course of the article, I note new directions for the community to investigate, with the objective of keeping physical layer security research targeted at having a practical impact on real systems.",

      "abstract": "Engineering ethics education is taking on increasing importance worldwide, but in Chile the percentage of universities that have a mandatory course concerning ethics is still small. Traditionally, Chilean universities with existing ethics courses teach them using a philosophical or theological perspective, limited to occidental theories, and usually from a Christian point of view. This article studies the impact of a new methodology and technique to teach ethics in Chile: case-based, non-normative, and with a critical-descriptive approach. An empirical study is conducted to assess the relative impact of an ethics class on students individual and inherent moral values and attitudes, and understand the factors that contribute to this impact. Results indicate that even though the importance of religion in Chile is decreasing, it is still a major source of students' ethical principles and moral values. In addition, results suggest that a change in moral values develops when discussions among groups with different points of view occur.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) in several application domains requires a well-defined infrastructure of systems that provides services for device abstraction and data management, and also supports the development of applications. Middleware for IoT has been recognized as the system that can provide this necessary infrastructure of services and has become increasingly important for IoT in recent years. The architecture of an IoT middleware is usually based on an SOA (service-oriented architecture) standard and has security requirement as one of its main challenges. The large amount of data that flows in this kind of system demands a security architecture that ensures the protection of the entire system. However, none of the existing SOAbased IoT middleware systems have defined a security standard that can be used as a reference architecture. In this sense, this article discusses the importance of defining a standard security architecture for SOA-based IoT middleware, analyzes concepts and existing work, and makes considerations about a set of security services that can be used to define a security architecture to mitigate the security threats in SOA-based IoT middleware systems.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an important research topic in the last decade, where things refer to interconnected machines and objects with embedded computing capabilities employed to extend the Internet to many application domains. While research and development continue for general IoT devices, there are many application domains where very tiny, concealable, and non-intrusive Things are needed. The properties of recently studied nanomaterials, such as graphene, have inspired the concept of Internet of NanoThings (IoNT), based on the interconnection of nanoscale devices. Despite being an enabler for many applications, the artificial nature of IoNT devices can be detrimental where the deployment of NanoThings could result in unwanted effects on health or pollution. The novel paradigm of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is introduced in this paper by stemming from synthetic biology and nanotechnology tools that allow the engineering of biological embedded computing devices. Based on biological cells, and their functionalities in the biochemical domain, Bio-NanoThings promise to enable applications such as intra-body sensing and actuation networks, and environmental control of toxic agents and pollution. The IoBNT stands as a paradigm-shifting concept for communication and network engineering, where novel challenges are faced to develop efficient and safe techniques for the exchange of information, interaction, and networking within the biochemical domain, while enabling an interface to the electrical domain of the Internet.",

      "abstract": "Wireless data traffic is increasing in an exponential manner, and thus vendors and operators are looking for cost-effective solutions to meet user equipment demands. In this article a joint optimization of the deployment and operation of small cells and macrocells is presented through the novel concept of sector offset configuration, which helps to significantly improve user equipment performance. The proposed sector offset configuration complements Release 10 enhanced intercell interference coordination, and further increases its interference mitigation capabilities. Simulation results for a Long Term Evolution network show that compared to a network that uses standardized Release 10 almost blank subframes, the proposed configuration can improve cell-edge user equipment performance by 50 percent. The proposed configuration can mitigate handover failures by 46 percent, since hand overs start at a higher signal quality due to alleviated interference conditions. These benefits come at the cost of an increased number of antennas at the macrocell site to achieve the sector offset configuration.",

      "abstract": "The continuously increasing consumption of power to access the Internet has been a major concern for network operators and equipment vendors. Passive optical network (PON) systems are widely seen as the future of broadband access. In 2010, ITU-T standardized a protocol-based PON energy efficiency mechanism that is comprised of two main modes, the doze mode and the cyclic sleep mode, which promise to save significant amounts of energy. However, the use of these two standardized alternative modes requires extra signaling and wastes energy. In this article we present the watchful sleep mode, a new mode that unifies the doze and cyclic sleep modes into a single power management mode. The new mode eliminates the extra control signaling and maximizes the amount of energy saved by keeping only the necessary hardware ON. Recently, the watchful sleep mode has been included in the ITU-T G.984 (G-PON) and ITUT G.987 (XG-PON) recommendations. It is expected to be operated as the only power management mode in future PON systems.",

      "abstract": "Physical layer secrecy has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to ensure communication secrecy with the use of channel coding and signal processing techniques (and without the explicit use of secret keys) in the physical layer. It serves as a promising technique for highly dynamic or ad hoc systems such as device-to-device and machine-type communication systems. However, the achievable secrecy performance depends highly on the level of CSI at the transmitter, the receiver, and the eavesdropper. In this article, we discuss how different levels of CSI resulting from conventional and unconventional ways of performing training and channel feedback may affect the confidentiality in terms of the information-theoretic (perfect) secrecy rate. The conventional approach refers to the emission of pilot signals from the transmitter and explicit channel feedback from the receiver. This approach is backward compatible with existing systems and allows the receiver to obtain accurate knowledge of the CSI, but may suffer from CSI leakage toward the eavesdropper. Unconventional approaches capitalize on reverse training to prevent CSI leakage and are shown to achieve significant improvements over conventional schemes in certain cases. For example, in a system with four transmit antennas and a single antenna at both the receiver and the eavesdropper, a secrecy rate gain of approximately 0.8 b/channel use at transmit SNR of 16 dB is observed over the full CSI case by providing CSI only to the transmitter (but not the receiver and the eavesdropper).",

To meet the technical and economical requirements for exponentially growing MTC traffic, we advocate the use of small cells to handle the massive and dense MTC rollout. We introduce a novel 3GPP-compliant architecture that absorbs the MTC traffic via home evolved NodeBs, allowing us to significantly reduce congestion and overloading of radio access and core networks. A major design challenge has been to deal with the interference to human-type traffic and the large degree of freedom of the system, due to the unplanned deployments of small cells and the enormous amount of MTC devices. Simulation results in terms of MTC access delay, energy consumption, and delivery rate corroborate the superiority of the proposed working architecture.",

The proposed framework developed within the NOVI research and experimentation European collaborative effort, aims at providing a modular data, control, and management plane architecture that includes: an information model capturing the abstractions of virtualized resources residing in different yet interworking experimental platforms; resource mapping algorithms tackling the inter-domain virtual network embedding problem; mechanisms providing interoperability of monitoring tools; policy-based management services for role-based intra and inter-domain management policies; and dataplane stitching mechanisms to enable the composition of user-specific slices (baskets of virtual resources drawn from the federated substrate). The NOVI framework was deployed and validated in a combined testbed consisting of two dissimilar platforms: a private PlanetLab domain with resources interconnected over the public Internet; and FEDERICA, an infrastructure of virtual resources interconnected via dedicated networking facilities of European National Research and Education Networks and G\u00c9ANT. This pre-normative work is expected to contribute to bridging Future Internet experimental federations with interconnected cloud architectures and interworked public/private data-centers, adding value via its intelligent services, information models, and composite algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Deploying service functions, SFs, is an essential action for a network provider. However, the action of creating, modifying and removing network SFs is traditionally very costly in time and effort, requiring the acquisition and placement of specialized hardware devices and their interconnection. Fortunately, the emergence of concepts like cloud computing, SDN, and ultimately NFV is expected to raise new possibilities for the management of SFs with a positive impact in terms of agility and cost. From a telco viewpoint these concepts can help to both reduce OPEX and open the door to new business opportunities. In this article, we identify how t\u00e9leos can benefit from the abovementioned paradigms, and explore some of the aspects that still need to be addressed in the NFV domain. We focus on two major aspects: enabling telco infrastructures to adopt this new paradigm, and orchestrating and managing SFs toward telco-ready cloud infrastructures. The technologies we describe enable a telco to deploy and manage SFs in a distributed cloud infrastructure. In this context, the Cloud4NFV platform is presented. Special attention is given to the way SFs are modeled toward cloud infrastructure resources. In addition, we explore the ability to perform service function chaining as one of the fundamental features in the composition of SFs. Finally, we describe a proof of concept that demonstrates how a telco can benefit from the described technologies.",

      "abstract": "This article presents the progressive evolution of NFV from the initial SDN-agnostic initiative to a fully SDN-enabled NFV solution, where SDN is not only used as infrastructure support but also influences how virtual network functions (VNFs) are designed. In the latest approach, when possible, stateless processing in the VNF shifts from the computing element to the networking element. To support these claims, the article presents the implementation of a flow-based network access control solution, with an SDN-enabled VNF built on IEEE 802.1x, which establishes services as sets of flow definitions that are authorized as the result of an end user authentication process. Enforcing the access to the network is done at the network element, while the authentication and authorization state is maintained at the compute element. The application of this proposal allows the performance to be enhanced, while traffic in the control channel is reduced to a minimum. The SDN-enabled NFV approach sets the foundation to increase the areas of application of NFV, in particular in those areas where massive stateless processing of packets is expected.",

      "abstract": "Several divergent application protocols have been proposed for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions including CoAP, REST, XMPP, AMQP, MQTT, DDS, and others. Each protocol focuses on a specific aspect of IoT communications. The lack of a protocol that can handle the vertical market requirements of IoT applications including machine-to-machine, machine-to-server, and server-to-server communications has resulted in a fragmented market between many protocols. In turn, this fragmentation is a main hindrance in the development of new services that require the integration of multiple IoT services to unlock new capabilities and provide horizontal integration among services. In this work, after articulating the major shortcomings of the current IoT protocols, we outline a rule-based intelligent gateway that bridges the gap between existing IoT protocols to enable the efficient integration of horizontal IoT services. While this intelligent gateway enhances the gloomy picture of protocol fragmentation in the context of IoT, it does not address the root cause of this fragmentation, which lies in the inability of the current protocols to offer a wide range of QoS guarantees. To offer a solution that stems the root cause of this protocol fragmentation issue, we propose a generic IoT protocol that is flexible enough to address the IoT vertical market requirements. In this regard, we enhance the baseline MQTT protocol by allowing it to support rich QoS features by exploiting a mix of IP multicasting, intelligent broker queuing management, and traffic analytics techniques. Our initial evaluation of the lightweight enhanced MQTT protocol reveals significant improvement over the baseline protocol in terms of the delay performance.",

In such environments, adapting the data exchange between devices and applications to the requirements of the application is a critical step in ensuring the functionality and reliability of the service. This article employs test-cases to analyze the data exchange of the oneM2M standard using an M2M-based automotive service delivery platform. Following the analysis, it proposes enhancements such as application-data-dependent criteria for data notification in combination with aggregation of different subscriptions to the same resource.

      "abstract": "NATO is currently working on the Federated Mission Networking (FMN) concept, which will become the foundation for establishing mission networks in the future. The realization of the FMN concept is described in the NATO FMN Implementation Plan (NFIP). The information infrastructure outlined in NFIP today builds on the concept of service-oriented architecture in order to achieve interoperability, and bases itself on many of the same standards and specifications as the ones identified through NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC). The NNEC SOA Baseline [1] identifies a number of core enterprise services that represent the common functionality needed to build an interoperable service-oriented infrastructure in a federation. It further identifies which standards should be used to realize these core services while ensuring interoperability between the federation members. A subset of these capabilities includes messaging services, collaboration services, service discovery, and security services. This article looks into each of these foundational core services, presents the challenges related to extending support for these services into the tactical domain, and identifies potential solutions.",

      "abstract": "For sustainability and environmental friendliness, renewable energy (RE) and distributed generation (DG), for example, photovoltaic, are being integrated in electrical systems in many countries. RE and DG, however, can be unstable for the power grid. As the power grid integrates an increasing amount of RE and DG, we present technical solutions along with an economic incentive model to enable data centers to serve as a novel \"interruptible\" load (i.e. a power load that can be scaled down temporally) to stabilize the power grid. We propose a novel real-time power analytics framework called embedded software as sensors, where software hooks are embedded into a range of data center subsystems, from chip to system to application level, to monitor ICT activities and power usage in a fine grained, real-time manner. Data from these virtual sensors are then mined to construct energy consumption models, which in turn are used to develop optimal algorithms for energy aware operation of computing, power distribution, and cooling systems in the data center. This holistic monitoring and optimization framework can reduce the overall power consumption of the data center, and furthermore enables time shifting of workloads in the data center in response to power fluctuations arising from the integration of RE and DG to the power grid.",

Meanwhile, cyber security is of paramount importance in M2M as all applications involving M2M cannot be widely accepted without security guarantees. In this article we focus on the standardization activities of 3GPP, especially group-based security for largescale M2M communications in 3GPP networks. We first introduce the main components of the machine-type communication (MTC) security architecture. Then we discuss several major challenges for group-oriented secure M2M communications in 3GPP systems, i.e. authentication signalling congestion and overload, and group message protection. Specifically, we identify the performance issues of authentication signalling congestion and overload in no/low mobility scenarios, and propose three group access authentication and key agreement protocols. Moreover, several 3GPP candidate solutions for group message protection are introduced. Finally, we present key issues and research directions related to group-based secure M2M communications, including security, privacy, and efficiency in mobility scenarios of MTC, and flexible and efficient group key management.",

      "abstract": "Cooperative relaying has been recognized as a promising technique to exploit spatial diversity gain using simple hardware, but it may barely fall in the class of green communications because extra power is consumed for information relaying. Recent advances in energy harvesting devices have paved the way for self-sustainable relays that power themselves by replenishing ambient energy without wires. This article examines the current progress of EH relays with special emphasis on wireless power transfer through RF signals that carry both information and energy at the same time. In this context, information relaying and EH are two tightly coupled processes, and practical constraints of EH devices pose new challenges to self-sustainable relays. This article addresses these issues and points out future research directions.",

Prior standards, and also oneM2M, while focusing on achieving interoperability at the communication level, do not achieve interoperability at the semantic level. An expressive ontology for IoT called IoT-O is proposed, making best use of already defined ontologies in specific domains such as sensor, observation, service, quantity kind, units, or time. IoT-O also defines some missing concepts relevant for IoT such as thing, node, actuator, and actuation. The extension of the oneM2M standard to support semantic data interoperability based on IoT-O is discussed. Finally, through comprehensive use cases, benefits of the extended standard are demonstrated, ranging from heterogeneous device interoperability to autonomic behavior achieved by automated reasoning.",

      "abstract": "The vast increase in the number of mobile devices and their mobile traffic demands indicates the need for additional spectrum for cellular communications. Since it is not trivial to allocate exclusively new spectrum bands for cellular communications, it is imperative to improve the spectrum usage through new spectrum sharing mechanisms. This implies that the mobile network operators will have to cooperate and interact to cover the augmented traffic requirements. In this article we present a novel architectural framework that enables the mobile network operators and other spectrum license holders to exchange information about spectrum availability. We also present a novel spectrum sharing mechanism based on fuzzy logic to facilitate operators in selecting the most suitable spectrum to cover their needs.",

      "abstract": "Wireless vehicular networks offer the promise of connectivity to vehicles that could provide a myriad of safety and driving-enhancing services to drivers and passengers. With wireless technology available in each car, it is expected that huge amounts of information will be exchanged between vehicles or between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Due to defective sensors, software viruses, or even malicious intent, legitimate vehicles might inject untrustworthy information into the network. Besides relying on the public key infrastructure, this article proposes a social network approach to study trustworthy information sharing in a vehicular network. We first cover recent research progress in measuring direct trust and modeling indirect trust in online social networks, and then discuss how to apply them to vehicular social networks despite several pressing research challenges.",

The powerful turbo equalization and FEC coding techniques enable both single-carrier modulation and OFDM systems to combat triply selective UWA channels. This article reviews the time-domain and frequency-domain turbo equalizer schemes for MIMO SCM systems. Low-complexity techniques are presented with both turbo linear equalizers and turbo soft decision feedback equalizers in both the time and frequency domains. Although results are shown specifically for UWA channels, these turbo equalizer techniques are also suitable for terrestrial RF communication systems.",

UDNs are expected to operate in the millimeter-wave band, where wide bandwidth signals needed for such high data rates can be designed, and will rely on high-gain beamforming to mitigate path loss and ensure low interference. The dense deployment of infrastructure nodes will make traditional wire-based backhaul provisioning challenging. Wireless self-backhauling over multiple hops is proposed to enhance flexibility in deployment. A description of the architecture and a concept based on separation of mobility, radio resource coordination among multiple nodes, and data plane handling, as well as on integration with wide-area networks, is introduced. A simulation of a multi-node office environment is used to demonstrate the performance of wireless self-backhauling at various loads.",

      "abstract": "Level crossings are critical elements of railway networks where a large number of accidents take place every year. With the recent enforcement of new and higher safety standards for railway transportation systems, dedicated and reliable technologies for level crossing surveillance must be introduced in order to comply with the safety requirements. In this survey the worldwide problem of level crossing surveillance is addressed, with particular attention to the recent European safety regulations. In this context, the capability of detecting, localizing, and discriminating the vehicle/obstacle that might be entrapped in a level crossing area is considered of paramount importance to save lives, and at the same time avoid costly false alarms. In this article the main solutions available today are illustrated and their pros and cons discussed. In particular, the recent ultra-wide bandwidth technology, combined with proper signal processing and backhauling over the already deployed optical fiber backbone, is shown to represent a promising solution for safety improvement in level crossings.",

      "abstract": "Laser sources enable highly efficient optical communications links due to their ability to be focused into very directive beam profiles. Recent atmospheric and space optical links have demonstrated robust laser communications links at high rate with techniques that are applicable to the undersea environment. These techniques contrast to the broad-angle beams utilized in most reported demonstrations of undersea optical communications, which have employed LED-based transmitters. While the scattering in natural waters will cause the beam to broaden, a narrowly directive transmitter can still significantly increase the optical power delivered to a remote undersea terminal. Using Monte Carlo analysis of the undersea scattering environment, we show the two main advantages of narrow-beam optical communication: increased power throughput and decreased temporal spread. Based on information theoretic arguments, gigabit-per-second class links can be achieved at 20 extinction lengths by utilizing pulse position modulation, single-photon-sensitive receivers, and modern forward error correction techniques.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to explain and analyze a growing problem in dense-urban wireless networks, that of co-existence between low-cost residential access points (APs) and actively-managed service provider APs in overlapping spatial, frequency, and time domains. Through detailed simulations and testbed experiments, the impact of increasing density of highly-adaptive service provider APs on the performance of typical residential APs is measured in terms of their respective channel assignment schemes. Simulation results with dense deployment of up to 500 APs/sq.km. show the benefits of centralized channel assignments, even in the presence of independent APs. In addition, it is shown that for a fixed AP density, an increase in the percentage of AP under the centralized scheme results in an increase in the throughput of surrounding independent APs. The broader implications of the simulation findings are discussed in order to develop a better macro-level understanding of dense Wi-Fi networks.",

Today the M2M landscape features an extreme diversity of available connectivity solutions which, due to the enormous economic promise of the IoT, need to be harmonized across multiple industries. To this end, we comprehensively review the most prominent existing and novel M2M radio technologies, as well as share our first-hand real-world deployment experiences, with the goal to provide a unified insight into enabling M2M architectures, unique technology features, expected performance, and related standardization developments. We pay particular attention to the cellular M2M sector employing 3GPP LTE technology. This work is a systematic recollection of our many recent research, industrial, entrepreneurial, and standardization efforts within the contemporary M2M ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Opportunistic routing (OR) is a promising paradigm that selects the next-hop forwarder on the fly. OR has gained a lot of attention from the research community for its ability to increase the performance of wireless networks. In OR a potential group of nodes (candidates) is selected to help as the next-hop forwarder. Each candidate that receives the packet can continue forwarding the packet. In OR, by using a dynamic relay node to forward the packet, the transmission reliability and network throughput are increased. Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) collect data from the environment and transfer them to the sonobuoys on the surface to send them to a center for further processing. Because of the acoustic channels common to UWSNs, they have low bandwidth, high error probability, and longer propagation delay compared to radio channels. These properties of UWSNs make them good potential candidates for using OR concepts to deliver packets to the destination. This article reviews and compares different OR protocols proposed for UWSNs. We classify the existing approaches in different categories, discuss representative examples for each class of protocols, and uncover the requirements considered by the different protocols, as well as the design requirements and limitations under which they operate. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for UWSNs using the OR paradigm.",

Then the authors describe a new method for radio access technologies called virtual RATs. The proposed scheme can provide a flexible and tailored access network that can meet the requirements and overcome the challenges in mobile broadband networks. The authors also present a high level design of the overall architecture and protocol stack for virtual RATs. Two concepts, virtual RAT Types and interface sets, are introduced. Two essential features, flexible control/user (C/U) plane separation and coordination between virtual RATs, are also discussed. Examples are provided to show how to achieve a flexible and tailored access network for services by using virtual RATs. Finally, the capability of hardware to support implementation of virtual RATs is analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Cellular networks have preserved an application agnostic and base station (BS) centric architecture1 for decades. Network functionalities (e.g. user association) are decided and performed regardless of the underlying application (e.g. automation, tactile Internet, online gaming, multimedia). Such an ossified architecture imposes several hurdles against achieving the ambitious metrics of next generation cellular systems. This article first highlights the features and drawbacks of such architectural ossification. Then the article proposes a virtualized and cognitive network architecture, wherein network functionalities are implemented via software instances in the cloud, and the underlying architecture can adapt to the application of interest as well as to changes in channels and traffic conditions. The adaptation is done in terms of the network topology by manipulating connectivities and steering traffic via different paths, so as to attain the applications' requirements and network design objectives. The article presents cognitive strategies to implement some of the classical network functionalities, along with their related implementation challenges. The article further presents a case study illustrating the performance improvement of the proposed architecture as compared to conventional cellular networks, both in terms of outage probability and handover rate.",

      "abstract": "The current device-centric protection model against security threats has serious limitations. On one hand, the proliferation of user terminals such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, smart TVs, game consoles, and desktop computers makes it extremely difficult to achieve the same level of protection regardless of the device used. On the other hand, when various users share devices (e.g., parents and kids using the same devices at home), the setup of distinct security profiles, policies, and protection rules for the different users of a terminal is far from trivial. In light of this, this article advocates for a paradigm shift in user protection. In our model, protection is decoupled from users' terminals, and it is provided by the access network through a trusted virtual domain. Each trusted virtual domain provides unified and homogeneous security for a single user irrespective of the terminal employed. We describe a user-centric model where nontechnically savvy users can define their own profiles and protection rules in an intuitive way. We show that our model can harness the virtualization power offered by next-generation access networks, especially from network functions virtualization in the points of presence at the edge of telecom operators. We also analyze the distinctive features of our model, and the challenges faced based on the experience gained in the development of a proof of concept.",

First, applications for phased arrays with tens to hundreds of elements are discussed. Existing solutions for scaling silicon-based phased arrays from microwave to terahertz frequencies are reviewed. The challenges and tradeoffs associated with multiple integration options for W-band phased arrays are analyzed, with special consideration given to packaging and antenna performance. Finally, a solution based on SiGe ICs and organic packages for a 64-element dual-polarized 94 GHz phased array is described, along with associated measurement results.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we propose dual-hop network architecture capable of providing high-speed communications to high-speed trains (HSTs). The system uses a seamless fiber-millimeterwave system for backhaul transmission from a central station to antennas on trains, and a highspeed in-train Wi-Fi network. The system can be combined with signal processing and network control technologies to compensate for interference and the Doppler effect, and to reduce the number of handovers. It can realize seamless connectivity between the inside and outside of trains to avoid penetration loss and help organize the in-train network optimally to increase coverage and data rate. We present and discuss the possible network architecture and technologies that can help realize the proposed network. We also present a proof-of-concept demonstration on a high-performance seamless fiber- MMW system that can be applied for applications in backhaul networks. The proposed network can be an attractive solution to provide broadband services such as video on demand and high-speed mobile signals to users on HSTs.",

This paper presents a detailed comparison of several waveforms in presence of nonlinear distortions and typical values of phase noise introduced at Q/W band. Two main types of waveforms have been compared: Constant Envelope multicarrier waveforms (CE-OFDM and CE-SCFDMA) and single carrier impulse-based waveforms (TH-UWB, DS-UWB and PSWF-based PSM). This comparison will allow to draw some practical guidelines for the waveforms design of EHF broadband satellite communications.",

      "abstract": "The introduction of smart electricity meters with cellular radio interfaces has placed an additional load on wireless cellular networks. Currently, these meters are designed for low duty cycle billing and occasional system check, which generates low-rate sporadic traffic. As the number of distributed energy resources increases, household power will become more variable and thus unpredictable from the viewpoint of the distribution system operator (DSO). Therefore, it is expected that in the near future there will be an increase in the number of wide area measurement system (WAMS) devices with phasor measurement unit (PMU)-like capabilities in the distribution grid, thus allowing utilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information required for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic profile will change drastically toward higher data volumes and higher rates per device. In this paper we characterize the current traffic generated by smart electricity meters, and we discuss the potential traffic requirements resulting from the introduction of enhanced smart meters, i.e. meters with PMUlike capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/ GPRS and LTE cellular system performance behaves with current generation and next generation smart meter traffic, where it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these wireless systems. We conclude by highlighting the possible solutions for upgrading the cellular standards, in order to cope with the upcoming smart metering traffic.",

      "abstract": "With ever growing mobile Internet and the explosion of its applications, users are experiencing abundant services from different content providers via different network service providers in the heterogeneous network. The information-centric network (ICN) advocates getting rid of the current host-centric network protocol because information dissemination rather than end-to-end communication contributes to the majority of today's network traffic. Furthermore, it is better for network entities to converge as a whole in order to take advantage of open, scalable, and smart traffic transmission. The cloud radio access network is one of the emerging architecture evolutions on the wireless side for easier infrastructure deployment and network management. Therefore, when the information-centric network meets the C-RAN in the Het-Net, it is worthwhile and consequential to integrate ICN protocol with C-RAN architecture to achieve more efficient communication and information management. Moreover, SDN has been recognized as another promising architecture evolution to achieve the flexibility and reconfigurability of dense HetNets; its inherent advantage lies in global uniform control of the wired network. Thus, any of ICN, C-RAN and SDN is the complementary to the others. In this article, we contribute to a fresh proposal for and elaboration of the integration of the ICN, CRAN, and SDN for the HetNet to achieve a win-win situation. The vision of the proposed system is demonstrated, followed by the advantages and challenges. We further present a hybrid system in a large-scale wireless heterogeneous campus network.",

We advocate for future networks where energy harvesting will be massively employed to power network elements; even further, communication networks will seamlessly blend with future power grids. This vision entails the fact that future base stations may trade some of the excess energy they harvest so as to make a profit and provide ancillary services to the electricity grid. We start by discussing recent developments in the energy harvesting field, and then deliberate on the way future energy markets are expected to evolve and the new fundamental trade-offs that arise when energy can be traded. Performance estimates are given throughout to support our arguments, and open research issues in this emerging field are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Recently, several indoor localization solutions based on WiFi, Bluetooth, and UWB have been proposed. Due to the limitation and complexity of the indoor environment, the solution to achieve a low-cost and accurate positioning system remains open. This article presents a WiFibased positioning technique that can improve the localization performance from the bottleneck in ToA/AoA. Unlike the traditional approaches, our proposed mechanism relaxes the need for wide signal bandwidth and large numbers of antennas by utilizing the transmission of multiple predefined messages while maintaining high-accuracy performance. The overall system structure is demonstrated by showing localization performance with respect to different numbers of messages used in 20/40 MHz bandwidth WiFi APs. Simulation results show that our WiFi-based positioning approach can achieve 1 m accuracy without any hardware change in commercial WiFi products, which is much better than the conventional solutions from both academia and industry concerning the trade-off of cost and system complexity.",

      "abstract": "A wideband signal sensor is an essential component to enable cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access techniques, providing real-time detection and modulation classification in a wideband environment of interest. The problem is challenging, requiring a processing suite incorporating detection, estimation, and classification, with stringent power objectives to enable widespread use in untethered battery powered devices. This article provides an overview of an integrated system-on-chip extremely low-power solution, including a wideband mixed-signal front-end, an algorithm suite that incorporates a blind hierarchical modulation classifier, and an ASIC implementation that employs dynamic voltage-frequency scaling and parallel processing that achieves measured energy efficiency ranging between 11.9 GOPS/mW and 13.6 GOPS/mW for full channel feature extraction, resulting in power consumption of 20.1-22.6 mW depending on the number of signals and signal bandwidth. The system bandwidth is selectable at 5, 50, and 500 MHz; in the 500 MHz case an efficient analog 8-point FFT channelizer relaxes the A/D requirement. The sensor can blindly detect and process up to 32 concurrent non-overlapping signals, with a variety of signal characteristics including single- vs. multi-carrier discrimination, carrier detection and estimation, and modulation classification.",

The pervasive and exponentially increasing data traffic present imminent challenges to all aspects of wireless system design, such as spectrum efficiency, computing capabilities, and fronthaul/backhaul link capacity. In this article, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the design of scalable wireless systems to embrace the big data era. On one hand, we review the state-of-the-art networking architectures and signal processing techniques adaptable for managing big data traffic in wireless networks. On the other hand, instead of viewing mobile big data as an unwanted burden, we introduce methods to capitalize on the vast data traffic, for building a big-data-aware wireless network with better wireless service quality and new mobile applications. We highlight several promising future research directions for wireless communications in the mobile big data era.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging computing concept that describes a structure in which everyday physical objects, each provided with unique identifiers, are connected to the Internet without requiring human interaction. Long-term and self-sustainable operation are key components for realization of such a complex network, and entail energy-aware devices that are potentially capable of harvesting their required energy from ambient sources. Among different energy harvesting methods, such as vibration, light, and thermal energy extraction, wireless energy harvesting (WEH) has proven to be one of the most promising solutions by virtue of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and availability. In this article, we present an overview of enabling technologies for efficient WEH, analyze the lifetime of WEH-enabled IoT devices, and briefly study the future trends in the design of efficient WEH systems and research challenges that lie ahead.",

      "abstract": "Wireless energy harvesting (WEH) is becoming one of the key techniques in energy harvesting in wireless networks. On the other hand, interference alignment (IA) is a promising solution for interference management in wireless networks. Although plenty of effort has been conducted on WEH and IA, these two important areas have been addressed separately in most of the existing literature. In this article we provide an overview of WEH in IA networks, and present a unified framework to jointly study WEH and IA. To simultaneously optimize both information transmission (IT) and WEH performance in IA networks, we propose a power splitting optimization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, we study the power allocation problem in the proposed PSO algorithm. Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed schemes for WEH in IA networks. Some interesting research challenges are also presented for the WEH in IA networks.",

Moreover, the most important link-level as well as system-level design aspects are elaborated on, along with a variety of potential solutions and research ideas. We envision that the dual interpretation of RF signals creates new opportunities as well as challenges requiring substantial research, innovation and engineering efforts.",

In this article, we describe a general framework for fingerprint embedding at the physical layer in order to provide message authentication that is secure and bandwidth-efficient. Rather than depending on channel or device characteristics that are outside of our control, deliberate fingerprint embedding for message authentication enables control over performance trade-offs by design. Furthermore, low-power fingerprint designs enhance security by making the authentication tags less accessible to adversaries. We define metrics for communications and authentication performance, and discuss the trade-offs in system design. Results from our wireless software-defined radio experiments validate the theory and demonstrate the low complexity, practicality, and enhanced security of the approach.",

The recent advance in RF-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) technology provides an attractive solution named wireless powered communication (WPC), where the wireless devices are powered by dedicated wireless power transmitters to provide continuous and stable microwave energy over the air. As a key enabling technology for truly perpetual communications, WPC opens up the potential to build a network with larger throughput, higher robustness, and increased flexibility compared to its battery-powered counterpart. However, the combination of wireless energy and information transmissions also raises many new research problems and implementation issues that need to be addressed. In this article, we provide an overview of state-of- the-art RF-enabled WET technologies and their applications to wireless communications, highlighting the key design challenges, solutions, and opportunities ahead.",

      "abstract": "Energy harvesting from ambient sources is emerging as a sustainable and environmentfriendly technique to prolong the lifetime of wireless devices. However, harvesting energy from these sources may not be feasible for quality- of-service (QoS)-constrained wireless applications. As such, dedicated wireless-powered cellular networks (WPCNs) are currently being investigated to ensure the reliability as well as improved battery lifetime of the wireless devices. With emerging WPCNs, a true wireless network can be envisioned, which is free of connectors, cables, and battery access panels, and guarantees freedom of mobility. To illustrate and understand the design requirements of WPCNs, this article first points out the key challenges of designing energy-harvesting cellular networks. These include the doubly near-far problem, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage experienced by the energy-harvesting devices located toward the cell-edge, the spatial characterization of the SNR outage zone, the additional resource consumption at energy transmitting sources, and the problems related to designing fairness-constrained user scheduling schemes. A brief overview of the related research advancements in WPCNs and a summary of their limitations are then provided. Finally, we list a few suggestions and design considerations that can potentially tackle the major challenges in emerging WPCNs and open up new research directions.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, copper network operators complement a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) strategy with a hybrid fiber-copper deployment in which fiber is gradually brought closer to the consumer, and digital subscriber line (DSL) technology is used for the remaining copper network. In this article we propose the system concepts of XG-FAST, the 5th generation broadband (5GBB) technology capable of delivering a 10 Gb/s data rate over short copper pairs. With a hardware proof-of-concept platform, it is demonstrated that multi-gigabit rates are achievable over typical drop lengths of up to 130 m, with net data rates exceeding 10 Gb/s on the shortest loops. The XG-FAST technology will make fiber-tothe- frontage (FTTF) deployments feasible, which avoids many of the hurdles accompanying a traditional FTTH roll-out. Single subscriber XG-FAST devices would be an integral component of FTTH deployments, and as such help accelerate a worldwide roll-out of FTTH services. Moreover, an FTTF XG-FAST network is able to provide a remotely managed infrastructure and a cost-effective multi-gigabit backhaul for future 5G wireless networks.",

Based on direct communications established between the base stations (BSs), i-Net can implement local data routing for mobile data traffic, which adapts to increased service localization for the mobile Internet. We first present the network architecture and main technical features, i.e., inter-connection, integration, and intelligence. Then the key techniques are discussed to show their potential in improving the network efficiency of i-Net. Field trials for inter-BS direct communications to implement cooperative multipoint oPeration (CoMP) in i-Net are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of i-Net. It is expected that i-Net can provide a good quality of experience for end users through the efficient integration of the multi-BS, multi-band, and multi-radio-access-technology (RAT) radio resources in 5G.",

As a key enabler, we further propose vConductor, an innovative technology due to its automatic network provisioning, multi-objective resource scheduling, and NFV-oriented inventory management characteristics. Finally, we show the feasibility through implementation of a prototype system. We believe that this contribution will be a catalyst to accelerate the industrialization of NFV.",
