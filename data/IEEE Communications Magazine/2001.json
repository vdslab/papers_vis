      "abstract": "Since the software radio concept was introduced, much progress has been made in the past few years in making it a reality. Many software radio based systems have been designed through the development efforts of both commercial and noncommercial organizations. While the term software radio has meant many things, the ultimate goal in software radio has been the realization of an agile radio that can transmit and receive signals at any carrier frequency using any protocol, all of which can be reprogrammed virtually instantaneously. Such a system places great demands on the limits of data converter and processor technologies since it requires real-time disposition of gigasamples of data produced by direct conversion of wireless signals into digital data. From a processing standpoint, the challenge in software radio is to exploit the three basic processor types-fixed architecture processors, FPGAs, and programmable DSPs/RISCs/CISCs-in such a way as to optimize the three-way trade-offs between speed, power dissipation, and programmability. With respect to the latter characteristic, the issues of high-level language interfaces, portability, and reprogramming speed must be considered. This article describes the architecture and operation of a PC-based software radio receiver. The development environment is a real-time PC-based platform that allows testing to be done in a simple manner using the main software functionality of a PC. The front-end of the receiver implemented in hardware represents a novel wideband design (bandwidth of up to 100 MHz centered at a carrier frequency of up to 2 GHz) that functionally converts wireless signals directly into a gigasample digital data stream in the receiver (and vice versa in the transmitter). This direct conversion approach shows the greatest promise in realizing the main goal of software radio.",

      "abstract": "In a comparative analysis the performance and capacity of DECT, PACS, and PHS for wireless local loop applications have been investigated. This article reports the results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The qualitative evaluation consists of a detailed comparison of the parameters of each standard and their relevance in WLL applications. In the quantitative analysis detailed simulations were performed covering diverse sets of conditions. The results of both types of analysis are presented. A major conclusion is that all three standards provide satisfactory performance for WLL applications. For low traffic environments PACS, which can employ larger cells, performs better than the other two standards. In suburban areas where, in addition to coverage capabilities, capacity is an issue, DECT has better performance. For high traffic density urban areas with great capacity requirements, the three standards all have good performance.",

The proposed differentiated services framework is seen as the key technology to achieve this. DiffServ currently concentrates on control/data plane mechanisms to support QoS, but also recognizes the need for management plane aspects through the bandwidth broker. In this article we propose a model and architectural framework for supporting DiffServ-based end-to-end QoS in the Internet, assuming underlying MPLS-based explicit routed paths. The proposed integrated management and control architecture will allow providers to offer both quantitative and qualitative services while optimizing the use of underlying network resources.",

      "abstract": "This article is a review of our ongoing research effort to construct a new multicarrier CDMA architecture based on orthogonal complete complementary codes, characterized by its innovative spreading modulation scheme, uplink and downlink signaling design, and digital receiver implementation for multipath signal detection. There are several advantages of the proposed CDMA architecture compared to conventional CDMA systems pertinent to current 2G and 3G standards. First of all, it can achieve a spreading efficiency (SE) very close to one (the SE is defined as the amount of information bit(s) conveyed by each chip); whereas SEs of conventional CDMA systems equal 1/N, where N denotes the length of spreading codes. Second, it offers MAI-free operation in both upand downlink transmissions in an MAI-AWGN channel, which can significantly reduce the co-channel interference responsible for capacity decline of a CDMA system. Third, the proposed CDMA architecture is able to offer a high bandwidth efficiency due to the use of its unique spreading modulation scheme and orthogonal carriers. Lastly, the proposed CDMA architecture is particularly suited to multirate signal transmission due to the use of an offset stacked spreading modulation scheme, which simplifies the rate-matching algorithm relevant to multimedia services and facilitates asymmetric traffic in up- and downlink transmissions for IP-based applications. Based on the above characteristics and the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed CDMA architecture has a great potential for applications in future wideband mobile communications beyond 3G, which is expected to offer a very high data rate in hostile mobile channels.",

One of the most important and complicated issues is quality of service guarantees in third-generation wireless networks. The purpose of this article is to propose a probabilistic resource estimation and semi-reservation scheme in considering the probability of real usage made by the mobile host. This scheme can efficiently improve the connection blocking probability, connection dropping probability, and bandwidth utilization.",

Networked appliances are widely viewed as the \"next wave\" of devices on the Internet. We discuss some possible uses for networked appliances and the requirements for communicating with them. We present details of a solution to meet these communication requirements based on the IETF Session Initiation Protocol. In addition, we discuss the rationale for our approach and reasons other approaches were not adopted. An example of the use of the SIP in this domain is presented to illustrate how the solution can be used. We conclude with outstanding challenges and reiterate advantages of this approach.",

The changes to TCP include a limited transmit mechanism for transmitting new packets upon receipt of one or two duplicate acknowledgments, and a SACK-based mechanism for detecting and responding to unnecessary fast retransmits or retransmit timeouts. These changes to TCP are designed to avoid unnecessary retransmit timeouts, to correct unnecessary fast retransmits or retransmit timeouts resulting from reordered or delayed packets, and to assist the development of viable mechanisms for corruption notification. The changes in the network include explicit congestion notification, which builds on the addition of active queue management.",

      "abstract": "Significant amounts of legacy software create a \"barrier\" to the adoption of advanced software engineering techniques in the telecommunications industry. To overcome this barrier, algorithms, methods, and powerful tools for automated extraction of formal models of the legacy telecommunication software are required. In this article we present a \"scenario-based\" approach to design recovery and evolution of legacy telecommunication software into formal models. Our approach is iterative and is based on extracting scenarios from the legacy software using a combination of dynamic and static strategies, and automatically synthesizing formal models from these scenarios. For the first step we use the KLOCwork Suite, which is capable of providing summarized structural, functional, and scenario models of existing software. For the second step we use the MOST Suite, which is capable of synthesizing state-based formal models from scenarios, formalized as extended message sequence charts. The article provides a detailed description of our design recovery methodology and compares it with related approaches. A case study is discussed where our scenario-based methodology is applied to recover the design of a small-sized telecommunications-like software system called the ToolExchange.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a simple integrated provisioning/protection scheme to dynamically allocate restorable bandwidth guaranteed paths in IP over WDM networks. A guaranteed restorable path implies that a flow of data is successfully routed if both an active path and another alternate link-disjoint path are found at the same time. Unlike the conventional approach, where the IP and WDM layers are not aware of each other, the new scheme takes advantage of the development in generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) to provide integrated end-to-end survivability by incorporating network state information from both layers (e.g., the cost information in physical links, the bandwidth usage on each lightpath, and intermediate router speed) into protection path allocation. Simulation results are used to evaluate the performance of the new scheme and show that the proposed protection approach can efficiently improve the network utilization, and deliver reliable services.",

      "abstract": "This article presents a survey of architectures, techniques, and algorithms for multicasting data in communication switching networks. We start with a broadcast architecture using a separate copy network and a routing network. A few versions of this idea using Delta and Benes networks exist. Another multicast architecture is a recycling network where internal nodes act as relay points, accept packets from the switching fabric, and recycle them back into the fabric after relabeling the packets. Next, we give an overview of a system that uses the Boolean splitting multicast algorithm. In this system a nonblocking self routing broadcast banyan copy network has been proposed. The network consists of several components including a running adder network to generate running sums of copy numbers specified in the headers of input packets. We then describe a multicasting technique presented for a different class of switching networks called deflection-routing networks. Finally, the idea of extending a nonblocking network to a three-dimensional structure consisting of multiple parallel planes is also presented. At the end of this article, we compare the efficiencies of the presented multicast architectures.",

The telecommunications network core needs new components to increase capacity while reducing cost: optics that enable faster line rates, more wavelengths per fiber, and longer spacing between repeaters. Metro networks need components to handle complex traffic patterns. A desire for network reconfigurability in both long-haul and metro segments drives demand for switches, but also for other associated components to condition signals after switching. The next generation of optical transport equipment will rely on new types of optical components to perform functions that do not yet exist in the network.",

All-optical packet switching provides high throughput, rich routing functionalities, and excellent flexibility. These characteristics make it an excellent candidate for next-generation metropolitan area networks, which will be much more dynamic and demanding than today's networks.

Many network operators and suppliers are developing control plane technology for application in transport networks. This will allow faster service provisioning, particularly between network operators, and the creation of new network services. However, such systems will still require comprehensive management systems, and successful operators and vendors of the future will be those that are capable of developing operational support systems that complement the control plane with service management capabilities, automated plan and build processes, inventory management, and capacity planning. This article examines the distribution of functionality between the management and central planes for support of soft permanent and switched connections.",

      "abstract": "In this new millennium, the most valuable commodity will be information, as seen by the surge in demand for faster access technologies such as cable modems, xDSL, and wireless data. The tremendous growth in data traffic, particularly that associated with the Internet, is changing the way it is carried over public and private networks. Together with the rapid advances in optical networking technology and the spawning of a new category of wavelength services stimulated by new high-speed data requirements, this is dramatically changing network architectures and the relationship between network service providers and their customers. Incumbent carrier globalization and new carrier entry require support for a broader set of business models and range of service interfaces. The growth and expansion of networks imply a greater need for more scalable solutions and more automation for network maintenance. An intelligent optical core optimized for service optical networking, the services optical network, needs to take the best aspects of both the transport and data networking domains to meet the above needs. This article focuses on architecting the services optical network to meet the challenges of optical data networking, and includes a snapshot of supporting standardization activities.",

      "abstract": "Optical access networks are beginning to be deployed at the edge of the optical backbone network to support access by the high-end users that drive increased bandwidth demands. This development in the applications of optical networking poses new challenges in the areas of medium access, topology design, and network management. In particular, since optical access networks carry high volumes of critical traffic, the level of reliability and robustness traditionally reserved for core applications must be implemented in access networks. We survey access network architectures and outline the issues associated with providing reliability for these architectures. In the area of architecture design, two main approaches emerge. The first considers dedicated optical access networks, such as stars or folded buses, to implement optical access LANs and MANs. The second is overlay architectures, which use existing network infrastructure. Overlay architectures seek to replicate, on a smaller scale, logical topologies akin to those of backbone networks, or may instead create architectures specifically designed for access purposes.",

      "abstract": "Watermarking is a potential method for protection of ownership rights on digital audio, image, and video data. Benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of different watermarking algorithms. For image watermarking, the Stirmark package is the most popular benchmark, and the best current algorithms perform well against it. However, results obtained by the Stirmark benchmark have to be handled carefully since Stirmark does not properly model the watermarking process and consequently is limited in its potential for impairing sophisticated image watermarking schemes. In this context, the goal of this article is threefold. First, we give an overview of the current attacking methods. Second, we describe attacks exploiting knowledge about the statistics of the original data and the embedded watermark. We propose a stochastic formulation of estimation-based attacks. Such attacks consist of two main stages: watermark estimation, exploitation of the estimated watermark to trick watermark detection or create ownership ambiguity. The full strength of estimation-based attacks can be achieved by introducing additional noise, where the attacker tries to combine the estimated watermark and the additive noise to impair watermark communication as much as possible while fulfilling a quality constraint on the attacked data. With a sophisticated quality constraint it is also possible to exploit human perception: the human auditory system in case of audio watermarks and the human visual system in case of image and video watermarks. Third, we discuss the current status of image watermarking benchmarks. We present Petitcolas'(see Electronic Imaging '99: Security and Watermarking of Multimedia Content, SPIE Proc., vol.3657, San Jose, CA, 1999) Stirmark benchmarking tool. Next, we consider the benchmark proposed by the University of Geneva Vision Group that contains more deliberate attacks. Finally, we summarize the current work of the European Certimark project, whose goal is to accelerate efforts from a number of research groups and companies in order to produce an improved ensemble of benchmarking tools.",

But what is the \"wireless Internet?\" There are a number of different answers to this question. The question poses problems for equipment manufacturers, service providers, and users alike. We desire seamless access to the Internet, and in order to have that, all these different modes must operate transparently for users. This article discusses how TIA/EIA standard IS-856 cellular data (1/spl times/EV) can be married with IEEE 802.11b wireless data to enable wide-area Internet access for service providers and users.

      "abstract": "Consumer demands for broadband communications at highway speeds will not likely be met by next-generation proposals. Although solutions exist for incremental improvements in capacity and bandwidth, the wireless industry has not yet offered an economical method for providing the broadband channels demanded by mobile consumers on the highway. The article examines a proposed high-capacity infrastructure with moving base stations for providing broadband communication services that are not limited by a user's speed. Moving base stations provide moving communication cells to mobile users traveling along a roadway. This broadband solution provides communication services with data rates of 20 Mb/s or more at any vehicular speed at costs comparable to wireline. In addition to presenting a general technical description of the proposed infrastructure, the discussion includes an overview of wireless technology and obstacles encountered in designing a high-capacity system providing high-bandwidth channels to users traveling at highway speeds.",

While working on these new technologies, it is easy to forget that fixed wireless access will form part of an integrated communications environment of the future where users will have one communications device working in the home, at the office, and outdoors. This article predicts the communications environment of the next 20 years and looks at the role of fixed access within that environment. This involves assessing how fixed access systems will interface and integrate with in-home wireless networks, how their architecture will enable multiservice operators to utilize the same core network across a range of different access technologies, and how they will act as a channel to carry mobile traffic originating within the building. Based on the requirements this vision and architecture implies, this article critically assesses the different fixed wireless technologies available to date and compares their capabilities to provide future-proof broadband fixed wireless platforms.",

      "abstract": "We elaborate on the management goals of next-generation cellular networks and describe how data-centric solutions can meet these goals. In a data-centric solution, operator applications act on a database representation of the cellular network. Network operations are invoked as a consequence to database changes, and the network, in turn, feeds the database with data such as network event notifications. The data-centric approach allows a focus on data as it is specified by the business needs of network management. This approach is augmented with data independence to assure consistent and flexible access of the data environment through the use of a common data interface. The data-centric design is contrasted with an application-centric design, and we conclude by providing suggestions on how application interface components can augment a data-centric network management solution.",

However, a key expectation of the optical network is that it will offer fast restoration capability, competitive in performance to SONET rings. To meet this expectation, there are key features that need to be added to the current proposals to extend MPLS for the optical network. This article discusses some of these key requirements.",

In turn, the design process for MPLS networks has much in common with the design of any IP network. This article examines MPLS and IP technology with particular emphasis on what is common between them. The common design steps of MPLS networks and other IP networks are outlined briefly, and those issues specific to MPLS networks are covered in more detail. This article emphasizes MPLS point of presence design, routing design issues for MPLS, and provisioning of sufficient label space.",

We conclude that given the starting point of the current Internet, certain of the proposed business models for Internet appliances are not likely to be viable, and this very fact protects the Internet's characteristically rapid pace of innovation.",

      "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is the standard for wireless LANs; it is widely used in testbeds and simulations for wireless multihop ad hoc networks. However, this protocol was not designed for multihop networks. Although it can support some ad hoc network architecture, it is not intended to support the wireless mobile ad hoc network, in which multihop connectivity is one of the most prominent features. In this article we focus on the following question: can the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol function well in multihop networks? By presenting several serious problems encountered in an IEEE 802.11-based multihop network and revealing the in-depth cause of these problems, we conclude that the current version of this wireless LAN protocol does not function well in multihop ad hoc networks. We thus doubt whether the WaveLAN-based system is workable as a mobile ad hoc testbed.",

Upon the arrival of a connection request, this mechanism must be able to select a route, assign a wavelength to the connection, and configure the appropriate optical switches in the network. The mechanism must also be able to provide updates to reflect which wavelengths are currently being used on each link so that nodes may make informed routing decisions. In this work, we review control mechanisms proposed in the literature. We also investigate and compare two different distributed control mechanisms for establishing all-optical connections in a wavelength-routed WDM network: an approach based on link-state routing, and one based on distance-vector routing.",

      "abstract": "A broadband satellite network uses a constellation of a number of similar satellites to provide wireless networking services to the Earth. A number of these constellation networks are under development. This article introduces the types of satellite constellation networks, and examines how overall performance of TCP communications carried across such a network can be affected by the choice of routing strategies used within the network. Constellations utilizing direct intersatellite links are capable of using multiple paths between satellites simultaneously as a strategy to spread network load. This allows more general routing strategies than shortest-path routing, but we show these strategies to be detrimental to the performance of individual TCP connections.",

      "abstract": "Second-generation mobile radio systems have been deployed successfully worldwide and have evolved to higher data rates and services. Third-generation mobile radio systems are currently starting to be developed in different regions of the world. Today, the open question is how the third-generation systems will evolve. It is very likely that fourth-generation systems will not be a single standardized air interface, but a set of different technologies and standards. In particular, wireless LAN/wireless PAN type systems are designed for high/medium-data-rate access, low range, and, in general, low mobility. They are applicable to corporate networks and public access as a complement to cellular mobile radio systems for hot spot applications such as airports, hotels, and campuses. In this specific WLAN/WPAN framework and to guarantee an agreed QoS provision over such infrastructures, we propose a solution based on the wireless adaptation layer approach. In particular, aspects related to wireless link impairments and traffic requirements are approached by the implementation of configurable, modular software that is adapted to the specific conditions and needs of the particular wireless infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "Distributed object computing middleware, such as CORBA, COM+, and Java RMI, shields developers from many tedious and error-prone aspects of programming distributed applications. It is hard to evolve distributed applications after they are deployed, however, without adequate middleware support for meta-programming mechanisms, such as smart proxies, interceptors, and pluggable protocols. These mechanisms can help improve the adaptability of distributed applications by allowing their behavior to be modified without changing their existing software designs and implementations significantly. This article examines and compares common meta-programming mechanisms supported by DOC middleware. These mechanisms allow applications to adapt more readily to changes in requirements and runtime environments throughout their lifecycles. Some of these meta-programming mechanisms are relatively new, whereas others have existed for decades. This article provides a systematic evaluation of these mechanisms to help researchers and developers determine which are best suited to their application needs.",

      "abstract": "Emerging streaming media applications in the Internet primarily use UDP transport. The difficulty with supporting this type of traffic on the Internet is that they not only generate large volumes of traffic, but they are also not as responsive to network congestion as TCP-based applications. As a result, streaming media UDP traffic can cause two major problems in the Internet: congestion collapse and unfair allocations of bandwidth among competing traffic flows. A solution to these problems is available in many Internet environments. The Internet backbone, various ISPs, and DSL access networks rely on ATM as their layer 2 transport technology, and in such environments, ATM's available bit rate service can efficiently address these problems. ABR is able to avoid congestion collapse and provide fair bandwidth allocations by distributing the unutilized bandwidth fairly among competing flows. This article presents simulation results and empirical measurements that illustrate the congestion collapse and unfairness problems, and ATM ABR's effectiveness in addressing those problems.",

      "abstract": "To date, research into reconfigurable mobile communications has predominantly focused on the software radio concept, and specifically on the hardware technologies required to move physical layer processing into a programmable environment. Although an interesting and necessary challenge, this only represents a fraction of the overall support and technology required to realize the potential of the concept. Other necessary developments include network/terminal cooperation for seamless interstandard handoff, QoS management, a secure software download mechanism, terminal software architecture supporting reconfiguration, configuration management, capability negotiation, and so on. Summarizing results from early project deliverables from a European Research project, IST-TRUST (Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal), this article describes the likely overall system environment and the key technical challenges to be researched for realizing a reconfigurable terminal to meet the needs of users within that environment.",

      "abstract": "IthACI has been a European project in the ACTS framework concentrating on fast layer 2 forwarding methods for IP traffic based on labeled flow mechanisms. The approach is also known as IP switching and is considered promising for enhancing IP performance. Several flavors of IP switching have been proposed by various vendors (e.g., IP switching by Ipsilon, Tag Switching by Cisco, ARIS by IBM, IPSOFACTO by the NEC), all of them different and not interoperable. IP switching has been adopted by the IETF under the umbrella of multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). Although MPLS has made remarkable progress, a number of issues remain largely open for further investigation. The scope of the IthACI project was to address such issues and propose solutions. The issues addressed were multicast, QoS, resource management, and mobility support in a multicast environment. IthACI conducted both theoretical and experimental work. Three network islands, each based on a different flavor of IP switching, were set-up and the interoperability of these different IP switching/MPLS flavors were investigated and demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "The current challenge in radio networks is to provide integrated broadband services to everybody. The realization of this goal is dependent on both the development of products for the mass market and the improvement of the systems that support these products. New cellular mobile, fixed terrestrial, and satellite systems are being developed to provide broadband integrated services. The users of these new systems will not need, or even want, to know which particular systems are used to access the requested services. The users may negotiate terms of delivery, such as data rate and quality of service, but the actual system of delivery should be transparent. In order to both achieve transparent service delivery and ensure efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum, a flexible and scaleable resource management system is needed. This article highlights the development trends that will form the basis of future network systems and presents some suggestions for the management and control of these systems.",

We then present applications of game theory to problems in random access and power control. In the case of random access, we examine the behavior of selfish users in a simplified Aloha system; surprisingly, rational selfish users do not implement the \"always transmit\" strategy that one might expect. In the case of power control, we show that game theoretic techniques can yield an optimal operating point without the intervention of an external controller.",

The development of GMPLS requires modifications to current signaling and routing protocols. It has also triggered the development of new protocols such as the Link Management protocol. We present the traffic engineering enhancements to the Open Shortest Path First Internet routing protocol and ISIS Intradomain Routing Protocol, two popular routing protocols, to support GMPLS. We present the concepts of generalized interfaces, label-switched path hierarchy, and link bundling intended to improve GMPLS scalability. We also discuss the Link Management Protocol which can be used to make the underlying links more manageable.",

The development of GMPLS necessitates enhancements to existing IP signaling and routing protocols. We present enhancements to two commonly used IP signaling protocols, RSVP and LDP, to support GMPLS. We illustrate the concept of hierarchical label switched path setup with an example, discuss mechanisms for bidirectional LSP setup, and describe the applications of suggested labels. We also discuss the important problem of protection and restoration in the GMPLS context. Finally, we describe how various recovery mechanisms can be implemented within the GMPLS framework.",

HNIT's membership includes consumer electronics executives, marketing and market research professionals, engineers, and standards developers, which provide a broad perspective on this subject. The article first introduces the rational behind the definition. From that baseline, it moves on to review some of the most critical issues home networks must address so as to meet the expectations of content and service providers-and ultimately those of the consumer. With that foundation, the article provides an overview of each of the major home networking protocols and standards, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses. Also included is a discussion of the interrelationships between the major standards and industry specifications: in other words, how they will work together to create a seamless home network environment.",

      "abstract": "Several emerging wireline and wireless access network technologies exhibit asymmetry in their network characteristics. For instance, cable modem networks exhibit significant bandwidth asymmetry, while packet radio networks exhibit media access asymmetry. A high degree of asymmetry can have an adverse effect on the performance of feedback-based transport protocols. We study the effects of bandwidth and media access asymmetry on the performance of the TCP protocol. We identify the fundamental reasons for the mismatch between TCP and asymmetric networks, and then present several techniques to address this problem.",

However, by default unresolved problems are addressed by the legal regime. The process of Java/sup TM/ standardization, which is a red thread in this article, well illustrates what may happen. In case of conflict between IPRs and compatibility interests, the legal regime is such that mostly IPR interests preside. Should we strive for more symmetry between IPRs and compatibility interests? The usual rationale for IPR regulation is that it stimulates innovation. The author argues that the public is equally served by compatibility. She analyses to what degree the public interest in compatibility is institutionalized in European, United States, and international regulation and end with questions that are meant to fuel policy debate.",

Legal and technical mechanisms to address these challenges are still very new, but important developments have occurred in the past few years. Because all of this is new, there are two reasons why researchers and developers of digital technologies need to understand the developments: first, to ensure that research and development is not conducted in a manner that is contrary to the new legal requirements; and second, to stimulate comments concerning legal developments that may have unintended consequences beyond the areas that are intended to be regulated. The purpose of this article is to provide an outline of certain important legal developments so that participants in the research and development field can be alerted to their existence and make appropriate inquiries and comments.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing need to provide better service differentiation in mobile ad hoc networks; however, this is challenging. These networks are characterized as being multihop in nature where the wireless topology that interconnects mobile hosts/routers can change rapidly in unpredictable ways or remain relatively static over long periods of time. Power and bandwidth constrained, mobile ad hoc networks typically only support best effort communications where the transport protocol's \"goodput\" is often lower than the maximum radio transmission rate after encountering the effects of multiple access, fading, noise, and interference. We evaluate three routing protocols with INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system that supports adaptive reservation-based services in mobile ad hoc networks. INSIGNIA represents a general-purpose approach to delivering quality of service in mobile ad hoc network supporting \"operational transparency\" between a number of IETF mobile ad hoc network routing protocols that include Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector, Dynamic Source Routing, and the Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm. We evaluate the performance gains delivered when using INSIGNIA with these MANET routing protocols in support of UDP and TCP traffic. The INSIGNIA ns-2 code used for the study reported in this article is available from the Web at comet.columbia.edu/insignia.",

      "abstract": "Digital watermarking, the art of robust information hiding in images, has gained a large interest in both research and industry in the past few years. Every watermarking system has two main parts: watermark embedding and watermark extraction/detection. Previous developments in the theoretical analysis of digital watermarking schemes have shown that there is a direct link between digital watermarking and communication theory. These parallels are extremely helpful when it comes to designing efficient and optimal watermark detectors. We focus on this issue and investigate how to design good watermark detectors taking into account the basics of communication theory. Furthermore, we discuss different ways to achieve robustness to geometrical attacks and elaborate on watermark attacks.",

      "abstract": "The satellite distribution of digital broadcast signals to the home has become widespread in the last seven years, delivering hundreds of television channels. We we have also seen other services appear, such as Direct PC/sup TM/ where data is broadcast. This service may be used to deliver information like stock quotes to a large number of users, or information such as Web pages may be requested by a single user. In the latter case, however, a return path is needed from the end user to the service provider in order to provide the specific information requested by the user. In services offered today this information is usually provided by a terrestrial return link, most often a telephone line. While a telephone line with a modem is adequate in most cases, it has the drawback of tying up an existing telephone line for a considerable amount of time for very little data transmission, or requiring an additional line. Furthermore, in many parts of the world a telephone line may not be readily available. In these cases a satellite return link may be a viable option using VSATs. We describe an investigation and simulation of a return path VSAT link designed specifically for delivery of Web traffic requests to a base station and thence via a terrestrial link, using the Internet, to a Web server. The focus in this work is on the MAC protocol to support such a satellite channel and on modeling the whole service from traffic generation through transport, network, and MAC layers to the physical channel.",

      "abstract": "Multimedia, including Internet traffic, can currently be multiplexed within the DVB/MPEG-2 formats and delivered direct to home users. Traditionally a slow terrestrial telephone link between the user and Internet service provider is used to request data. A direct return channel system will facilitate users' high-bit-rate bidirectional communication via satellite. The return link could be used for the fast Internet access or large data exchanges that will be necessary in a multimedia world. The satellite system not only removes the need for wires but also increases transfer speeds. Satellite interactive terminals can establish network connections via satellite and a ground-based hub. The DVB/MPEG-2 format carries up to 45 Mb/s in the forward link, and a multifrequency time-division multiple access scheme allows up to 2 Mbit/s in the return direction. The return channel of the interactive channel for multimedia satellite networks underwent final standardization by ETSI in early 2000. This article reviews the system concept of a typical implementation. The key features of the return channel air interface, from transmission parameter to login procedure, are explained. In general, Internet packets are expected to be carried via DVB/MPEG-2 in the forward direction and via ATM in the return direction. The IP transportation techniques are described.",

In response, both the incumbent operator and new entrants had to adopt aggressive strategies to defend or gain market share. This article reports on an intensive experiment on IDD quality provided by the major IDD operators in Hong Kong after this phase of deregulation. Based on 1790 successful IDD calls to the 10 most popular destinations from Hong Kong, the IDD quality of the major operators was benchmarked. The experiment revealed some interesting findings with significant implications for telecommunications deregulation.",

      "abstract": "This article provides an introduction to Internet accounting and discusses the status of related work within the IETF and IRTF, as well as certain research projects. Internet accounting is different from accounting in POTS. To understand Internet accounting, it is important to answer questions like \"what is being paid for\" and \"who is being paid\". With respect to the question \"what is being paid for\" a distinction can be made between transport accounting and content accounting. Transport accounting is interesting since techniques like DiffServ enable the provision of different quality of service classes; each class will be charged differently to avoid all users selecting the same top-level class. The interest in content accounting finds its roots in the fast growth of commercial offerings over the Internet; examples of such offerings include remote video and software distribution. The question \"who is being paid\" has two possible answers: the network provider or the owner of the content. The case in which the network provider issues the bill is called provider-based accounting. Since this case will become more and more important, this article introduces a new architecture for provider-based accounting.",

      "abstract": "The Internet's emergence as a worldwide digital infrastructure has dramatically encouraged a market for communications-oriented appliances, such as mobile phones, personal assistants, network-enabled games, interactive television, Internet telephony, and Internet facsimile. The marketplace is developing rapidly, along with specialized Internet-based \"linking\" services to connect these devices. Generally two different technical approaches are being explored for these services. One uses classic Internet technology, such as e-mail or the World Wide Web; the other incorporates unique standards, often derived from earlier non-Internet specifications. This article explores efforts to create Internet facsimile appliances, contrasting them with devices for Internet telephony. Efforts at Internet facsimile have produced two different sets of standards. Store-and-forward Internet facsimile is specialized as a profile of classic Internet mail. Real-time Internet facsimile uses a specialized protocol.",

      "abstract": "Optical layer control planes based on MPLS and other Internet protocols hold great promise because of their proven scalability, ability to support rapid provisioning, and auto discovery and self-inventory capabilities and are under intense study in various standards bodies. To date however little attention has been paid to aspects of the optical layer which differ from those found in data networking. We study three such aspects which impact routing: network elements which are reconfigurable, but in constrained ways; transmission impairments which may make some routes unusable; and diversity. We conclude that if emerging optical technology is to be maximally exploited, heterogeneous technologies with dissimilar routing constraints are likely. Four alternative architectures for dealing with this eventuality are identified and some trade-offs between centralizing or distributing some aspects of routing are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The design of a large-scale wireless LAN poses a number of interesting questions. Building the Wireless Andrew network at Carnegie Mellon University has given us the opportunity to deal with these questions. This article describes the approaches we have developed for the design of similar networks. A large-scale wireless LAN must be designed so that all of the target space has radio coverage (i.e., there are no coverage gaps). It must also be designed so that its capacity is adequate to carry the expected load. These requirements generally can be met by using the proper combination of access point locations, frequency assignments, and receiver threshold settings.",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth of both the wireless industry and the Internet is creating a huge market opportunity for wireless data access. Limited Internet access, at very low speeds, is already available as an enhancement to some existing cellular systems. However, those systems were designed with the purpose of providing voice services and-at most-short messaging, but not fast data transfers. In fact, as shown in this article, traditional wireless technologies are not very well suited to meet the demanding requirements of providing very high data rates with the ubiquity, mobility, and portability characteristic of cellular systems. Increased use of antenna arrays appears to be the only means of enabling the types of data rates and capacities needed for wireless Internet and multimedia services. While the deployment of base station arrays is becoming universal, it is really the simultaneous deployment of base station and terminal arrays that can unleash unprecedented levels of performance by opening up multiple spatial signaling dimensions.",

MEMS optical switches with complex movable 3D mechanical structures, micro-actuators, and micro-optics can be monolithically integrated on the same substrate by using the matured fabrication process of the integrated circuit industry. In this article we report various popular actuating mechanisms and switch architectures of MEMS optical switches. The basics of surface and bulk micromachining techniques used to fabricate MEMS devices are reviewed. Examples of 2D and 3D approaches to MEMS optical switches are described. The pros and cons of the two approaches are analyzed. In the short term, MEMS-based optical switches seem to have captivated the attention of both the industry and academia. However, there are challenges that threaten the long-term survival of this technology. The problems that remain to be fully addressed are discussed.",

      "abstract": "New emerging IP services based on differentiated services and the IP security architecture offer the level of communication support that corporate Internet applications need nowadays. However, these services add an additional degree of complexity to IP networks which will require sophisticated management support. The management of enhanced IP services for their customers is thus an emerging important task for Internet service providers. This article describes a potential management architecture service providers will need for that task, considering problems such as multiprovider services and service automation. We focus on a quality-enhanced virtual private network service which is particularly useful for corporate internetworking.",

      "abstract": "The efficient management of a quality level of Internet service is becoming increasingly important to both customers and service providers. This article describes how service level agreements for multimedia Internet service can be managed and controlled. We first present a literature survey on the problems of SLA management: SLA parameter definition, SLA measurement, and QoS management. We present a utility model to capture the management and control aspects of SLAs for multimedia Internet service. This utility model has been used in microeconomics theory, but here we have applied it to SLA management. This model provides a computationally feasible solution for admission control and quality adaptation for multimedia Internet service and SLA management. It also allows management policies to be flexibly expressed by service providers. Finally, we apply the utility model to the SLA management of VoIP service and describe how to use it for admission control, dynamic quality adaptation, and resource allocation for SLA assurance.",

      "abstract": "Most ad hoc mobile devices today operate on batteries. Hence, power consumption becomes an important issue. To maximize the lifetime of ad hoc mobile networks, the power consumption rate of each node must be evenly distributed, and the overall transmission power for each connection request must be minimized. These two objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously by employing routing algorithms proposed in previous work. We present a new power-aware routing protocol to satisfy these two constraints simultaneously; we also compare the performance of different types of power-related routing algorithms via simulation. Simulation results confirm the need to strike a balance in attaining service availability performance of the whole network vs. the lifetime of ad hoc mobile devices.",

      "abstract": "We present the system concept of a dynamically configurable all-optical add/drop multiplexer for metropolitan wavelength division multiplex rings using dense channel spacing (DWDM). We first outline the essential network requirements. Subsequently, an optical system concept is presented that meets these requirements. In the network elements, innovative all-optical switching technology is employed. Tunable fiber Bragg gratings that perform routing functions by wavelength filtering are discussed in more detail. The system is laboratory-tested. It has been installed in Berlin for a multi-vendor field trial within the German research program \"KomNet.\" Three optical add/drop multiplexers form a dynamically configurable Metro DWDM ring. Metro DWDM accommodates high bandwidths: a metropolitan ring that provides 0.8 terabit/s ring capacity has been demonstrated. Furthermore, Metro DWDM can provide optically transparent channels enabling the transport of various data formats simultaneously, e.g., SONET/SDH and Gigabit Ethernet. Conversion to a standard format becomes obsolete. The all-optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM) presented provides both manual and dynamic configuration. The system concept of the OADM is developed starting with basic metropolitan DWDM network requirements. The features of the DWDM ring are described, followed by a presentation of the system concept of the flexible OADM. Our focus is on dynamic configuration techniques. Since tunable fiber Bragg gratings are promising components for dynamic optical channel switching, this technology is treated in more detail.",

      "abstract": "The next generation in mobility management will enable different mobile networks to interoperate with each other to ensure terminal and personal mobility and global portability of network services. However, in order to ensure global mobility, the deployment and integration of both satellite and terrestrial components are necessary. This article is focused on issues related to mobility management in a future mobile communications system, in a scenario where a multisegment access network is integrated into an IP core network by exploiting the principles of Mobile IP. In particular, attention is given to the requirements for location, address, and handover management. In a heterogeneous environment, the need to perform handover between access networks imposes particular constraints on the type of information available to the terminal and network. In this case, consideration will need to be given to parameters other than radio characteristics, such as achievable quality of service and user preference. This article proposes a new approach to handover management by applying the fuzzy logic concept to a heterogeneous environment. The article concludes with a presentation of mobility management signaling protocols.",

This is motivated by the need to provide a greater level of adaptivity to variations of wireless channels. This article examines one aspect of the interaction between the physical and medium access control layers. In particular, we consider the impact of signal processing techniques that enable multipacket reception on the throughput and design of random access protocols.",

      "abstract": "In this article we propose a framework for multipath routing in mobile ad hoc networks and provide its analytical evaluation. The instability of the topology (e.g., failure of links) in these types of networks, due to nodal mobility and changes in wireless propagation conditions, makes transmission of time-sensitive information a challenging problem. To combat this inherent unreliability of these networks, we propose a routing scheme that uses multiple paths simultaneously by splitting the information among the multitude of paths, to increase the probability that the essential portion of the information is received at the destination without incurring excessive delay. Our scheme works by adding some overhead to each packet, which is calculated as a linear function of the original packet bits. The resulting packet (information and overhead) is fragmented into smaller blocks and distributed over the available paths. Our goal is, given the failure probabilities of the paths, to find the optimal way to fragment and then distribute the blocks to the paths so that the probability of reconstructing the original information at the destination is maximized. Our algorithm has low time complexity, which is crucial since the path failure characteristics vary with time and the optimal block distribution has to be recalculated in real time.",

      "abstract": "In an effort to eliminate the electronic bottleneck, new optical switches/routers (hardware) are being built for the next-generation optical Internet where IP runs over an all-optical WDM layer. However, important issues yet to be addressed in terms of protocols (software) are how to develop a new paradigm that does not require any buffer at the WDM layer, as in circuit switching, and elimination of any layers between which exist mainly due to historical reasons. At the same time, such a paradigm should also efficiently support bursty traffic with high resource utilization as in packet switching. This article surveys design issues related to a new switching paradigm called optical burst switching, which achieves a balance between circuit and packet switching while avoiding their shortcomings. We describe how OBS can be applied to the next-generation optical Internet, and in particular how offset times and delayed reservation can help avoid the use of buffer, and support quality of service at the WDM layer.",

Coupled with this growth has been the introduction of client devices (e.g., routers, storage devices, and content servers) at the network edge operating at optical line rates. These two trends are changing the fundamental way in which optical transport networks are being architectured, deployed, and managed. Emerging intelligent optical networks address the traffic scaling challenge. Additionally, when combined with modern service management technologies, these networks open exciting opportunities for delivering new customized optical services directly to end-users, allowing carriers to fully exploit the economics of optical transport. This article presents a network framework for delivering optical services.",

In particular, the drive toward wireless and highly heterogeneous infrastructures supporting IP services transparently and independent of the underlying physical layer is a challenge. In this context, this article focuses on introducing an implementation of a generic performance-enhancing proxy, called the wireless adaptation layer, and particularly its forward error control enhancement module. The error control module is a potentially important tool for achieving better UDP and TCP performance over the inherently unreliable wireless channels, and providing some adaptation for that. In order to assess the benefits and drawbacks of the selected design, we have also conducted some performance measurements over IEEE 802.11b WLANs.",

The key is broadband and high-quality communications to support multimedia services, and the use of millimeter or centimeter-wave band and ARQ is being considered to realize such communications. In this article we propose a new ARQ scheme which is combined with SR and GBN, and confirm that this new scheme is proper for broadband communication systems. We implemented our ARQ function with hardware and evaluated the ARQ performance: throughput, cell loss rate, and cell transfer delay on a pseudo Rayleigh fading channel. In addition, we evaluated ARQ performance on an actual 40 GHz band radio channel. Through the evaluation, we found it necessary to design an ARQ scheme in accordance with system requirements, and our combined ARQ satisfies this required condition.",

      "abstract": "In the backbone network, the high level of traffic aggregation achieved by numerous users is efficiently served by means of optical circuit switched solutions-the so-called wavelength routing approach. In the access and metro networks, on the contrary, the reduced level of traffic aggregation makes wavelength routing solutions inadequate. The finer and more dynamic bandwidth allocation provided by packet-interleaved optical time-division multiplexing is thus advocated in these network areas. This article presents a survey of an OTDM approach, known as photonic slot routing, or PSR. It is illustrated how this approach may provide a cost-effective solution to deploying all-optical access and metro networks with today's technology.",

      "abstract": "The Olympic Games pose a special challenge for telecommunications since they should aim at two mutually contradicting targets. On one hand they should use mature, reliable, and well-known technology, while on the other hand they should exploit the latest achievements of technology. Furthermore, detailed planning should begin at least four years before the Games, given that the International Olympic Committee demands that technology should be fixed two years before the Games. In most cases in the past, it has been possible to predict an optimum point of equilibrium and to plan the use of a technology that would be new enough to be innovative, yet mature enough to be reliable. The 2004 Olympic Games is a different case because telecommunications technology is not only evolving at a fast pace but is also at a crossroads (i.e., circuit-based vs. IP-based networks). This last issue makes the challenge more difficult than ever to meet. The Hellenic Telecommunication Organization was named the exclusive provider of all telecommunications services of the Games. We present an analysis of this special challenge and our plans for handling it.",

The point of departure is an assumed future two-level structure in which the transport is by means of steadily growing interconnected all-optical islands of transparency, while the remainder of the communication layers are based on IP, both levels being managed by an MPLS-based control plane. After reviewing why such networks are becoming inevitable, a review is given of the various optical layer technology and architecture bottlenecks that have had to be solved. Issues that remain center on increasing the number of channels and reducing the technology costs.",

We introduce the results from a research project where we have been working toward implementing a functionally minimized Web server on silicon. Although most embedded Internet appliances will use a microcontroller and software to enable TCP/IP and HTTP support, we argue that there are many applications where a hardware-based approach is more suitable. Our WebChip approach is a family of IPv6-compatible solutions toward the realization of embedded and minimized Web systems. The core parts of the implementation are a C-code library and VHDL code implementation. The solution is tested with an FPGA and can be later embedded into various ASIC chips. We argue that this approach is also commercially viable since the VHDL code can be delivered as an intellectual property block.",

Constraints and requirements specific to this family of systems are identified, and possible technical solutions to mitigate the undesirable effects are outlined. The main features and technology characteristics of the SAMBA project trial platform are described, including the air interface and cell coverage characteristics, for a better understanding of the MBS challenge. The article concludes with a discussion about how MBS integrates with 3G systems add how it paves the way for the next-generation networks.",

      "abstract": "Introducing quality of service features to the IP/TCP protocol suite has become a hot topic of research in both industry and academia. Several architectures have been proposed for QoS support at the network layer (layer 3 in the OSI model). Both integrated services and differentiated services architectures are examples of QoS models that are implementable at the IP layer. Another development at the IETF is the work related to traffic engineering using multiprotocol label switching. While traffic engineering covers a wide range of topics, QoS support is recognized as one of its necessary features. This article describes the QoS features of the constraint-route label distribution protocol and how they can be efficiently utilized to achieve service interworking between a number of different networking technologies.",

      "abstract": "Ad hoc wireless networks consist of mobile nodes interconnected by multihop communication paths. Unlike conventional wireless networks, ad hoc networks have no fixed network infrastructure or administrative support. The topology of the network changes dynamically as mobile nodes join or depart the network or radio links between nodes become unusable. This article addresses some of the quality of service issues for ad hoc networks which have started to receive increasing attention in the literature. The focus is on QoS routing. This is a complex and difficult issue because of the dynamic nature of the network topology and generally imprecise network state information. We present the basic concepts and discuss some of the results. The article concludes with some observations on the open areas for further investigation.",

The BRAIN project is developing a system architecture which combines local coverage broadband radio access systems based on HIPERLAN/2 with several wider-coverage mobile radio systems, enabling full coverage of seamless IP-based services for users in hot spot areas and on the move. End-to-end QoS provision is one of the major challenges in the design of such a system and must be supported by the application, network, and wireless access layers.

      "abstract": "Currently, the RSVP model, which is efficient resource reservation in the fixed endpoints, becomes invalid under host mobility. We investigate the problems of standard RSVP in providing real-time services in wireless mobile networks. We also observe carefully how to interoperate IntServ services over DiffServ networks, and how to map IntServ QoS parameters into a wireless link. We then identify the advantages and drawbacks of the existing RSVP proposals to support QoS under both micromobility and macromobility. We finally propose a dynamic resource allocation scheme for reducing service disruption of real-time applications due to frequent mobility of a host.",

Wide-band CDMA and its hybrid associate time-division CDMA are key elements of the IMT2000 framework of standards. Since the beginning of the 1990s there has been enormous research activity in analysis of the soft (i.e., interference limited) capacity of these CDMA-based systems. Optimal usage of the soft capacity to provide, maintain, and guarantee QoS for different service classes is now becoming a very important issue. Therefore, interest in radio resource allocation has recently. This article presents an overview of RRA schemes (primarily for CDMA-based systems) that are flexible, support traffic services with various QoS requirements, minimize call/session blocking and dropping probabilities, and have acceptable radio resource utilization.",

      "abstract": "Refactoring can be an important ingredient in the strategy for development and evolution of complex telecommunications software systems. Refactoring is one way to reuse and extend a successful software system. This article presents some design tactics that will assist a development team when they choose evolution from an existing software system over building a completely new system from the ground up. Strictly speaking, the refactoring process changes only the internal design of the software. Refactoring does not add any new functionality. However, the goal of refactoring work is to pave the way for the software to be modified and extended more easily. The simplest example of redesign is the creation of simple \"wrapper classes\" that contain groups of functions extracted from the legacy code. More complex design patterns are also useful when attempting to improve the design. Developers usually divide the redesign work into stages so that each stage can be implemented and tested separately. This article describes a real-world example of this approach that shows how refactoring improved the design of a wireless base station controller product.",

The reconfigurable feature is useful for enhancing functions of equipment without replacing hardware. Multimode operation is essential for future wireless terminals because a number of wireless communication standards will still coexist. Research efforts on SDR have become very active in Japan, and various kinds of SDR prototypes have been developed. This article introduces the trends of Japanese wireless communication systems and the role of SDR technologies for the future wireless systems. R&amp;D activities for the SDR in the field of academia and industry are also presented including examples of SDR prototypes.",

The key parts of the standards are already in place, and limited 3G services have already been turned on. While the evolution to 3G occurs, many operators will implement 2.5G interim solutions for a good period of time. We discuss the various evolution scenarios from the present 2G networks to 3G networks. Then we present the UMTS QoS architecture and its requirements, followed by a discussion on QoS in 3G air interfaces, radio access network, and core network.",

Compression and transmission provisions that avoid catastrophic failure caused by lost, delayed, or errant packets are therefore imperative in order to provide reliable visual communication over such systems. This robustness is obtained by modifying the source coding and/or adding channel coding. This article presents an overview of both lossy and lossless source coding techniques and combined source/channel techniques providing robustness, presenting examples of successful techniques.",

      "abstract": "When accessing IP-ready appliances at home from a remote site, security is a major concern. We address the seemingly common scenario of accessing IP-ready appliances behind a home firewall from a remote PC within a corporate intranet. The scenario reveals the complex nature of secure remote access. Various IP tunneling technologies can provide secure remote access without sacrificing the ubiquitous accessibility of the Internet; however, the problem of multiple authentication processes is evident in the framework. Digital certificate technology can simplify the authentication process required to establish multiple IP tunnels. However, IP tunneling technologies do not scale well, and become infeasible if the number of firewalls to traverse increases. Scalability and end-to-end security requirements call for the deployment of authenticated firewall traversal methods that use minimal or no IP tunnels. This article describes a meet-in-the-middle network model as a simple and practical method.",

      "abstract": "Internet-enabled wireless devices continue to proliferate and are expected to surpass traditional Internet clients in the near future. This has opened up exciting new opportunities in the mobile e-commerce market. However, data security and privacy remain major concerns in the current generation of \"wireless Web\" offerings. All such offerings today use a security architecture that lacks end-to-end security. This unfortunate choice is driven by perceived inadequacies of standard Internet security protocols like SSL on less capable CPUs and low-bandwidth wireless links. This article presents our experiences in implementing and using standard security mechanisms and protocols on small wireless devices. We have created new classes for the Java 2 Micro-Edition platform that offer fundamental cryptographic operations such as message digests and ciphers as well as higher level security protocols like SSL. Our results show that SSL is a practical solution for ensuring end-to-end security of wireless Internet transactions even within today's technological constraints.",

We give a global description of the building blocks used by the basic operation of the network; they all rely on various concepts of self-organization. Routing uses a combination of geography-based information and local MANET-like protocols. Terminode positioning is obtained by either GPS or a relative positioning method. Mobility management uses self-organized virtual regions. Terminodes employ a form of virtual money called nuglets as an incentive to collaborate. Lastly, we discuss directions for providing some level of security.",

The quality of service of such networks is limited by the low bandwidth of acoustic transmission channels, high latency resulting from the slow propagation of sound, and elevated noise levels in some environments. The long-term goal in the design of underwater acoustic networks is to provide for a self-configuring network of distributed nodes with network links that automatically adapt to the environment through selection of the optimum system parameters. This article considers several aspects in the design of shallow water acoustic networks that maximize throughput and reliability while minimizing power consumption.",

      "abstract": "The application of adaptive antenna techniques to fixed-architecture base stations has been shown to offer wide-ranging benefits, including interference rejection capabilities or increased coverage and spectral efficiency. Unfortunately, the actual implementation of these techniques to mobile communication scenarios has traditionally been set back by two fundamental reasons. On one hand, the lack of flexibility of current transceiver architectures does not allow for the introduction of advanced add-on functionalities. On the other hand, the often oversimplified models for the spatiotemporal characteristics of the radio communications channel generally give rise to performance predictions that are, in practice, too optimistic. The advent of software radio architectures represents a big step toward the introduction of advanced receive/transmit capabilities. Thanks to their inherent flexibility and robustness, software radio architectures are the appropriate enabling technology for the implementation of array processing techniques. Moreover, given the exponential progression of communication standards in coexistence and their constant evolution, software reconfigurability will probably soon become the only cost-efficient alternative for the transceiver upgrade. This article analyzes the requirements for the introduction of software radio techniques and array processing architectures in multistandard scenarios. It basically summarizes the conclusions and results obtained within the ACTS project SUNBEAM, proposing algorithms and analyzing the feasibility of implementation of innovative and software-reconfigurable array processing architectures in multistandard settings.",

      "abstract": "An ad hoc network must operate independent of a preestablished or centralized network management infrastructure, while still providing administrative services needed to support applications. Address allocation, name resolution, service location, authentication, and access control policies represent just some of the functionality that must be supported-without preconfiguration or centralized services. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to leverage some aspect of the environment in which the network operates. We introduce the notion of a spontaneous network, created when a group of people come together for some collaborative activity. In this case, we can use the human interactions associated with the activity in order to establish a basic service and security infrastructure. We structure our discussion around a practical real-world scenario illustrating the use of such a network, identifying the key challenges involved and some of the techniques that can be used to address them.",

Although direct digitization usually implies the simultaneous digitization of all channels in a particular band at a downconverted IF, we use this term to refer exclusively to the direct digitization of all bands, from near DC to RF. Furthermore, we present results on band selection and digitization of RF signals directly at the carrier frequency with high resolution. These novel approaches are enabled by a superconductor analog-to-digital converter technology using an ultra-fast IC logic known as Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic, with performance capable of enabling envisioned software radios.",

At the same time the cellular networks, with their ability to reach a person \"anywhere, anytime,\" have grown impressively as well. Thus the combination of mobile networks and the Internet into the so called \"mobile Internet\" promises to be an important technology area. The indications are clear: the cellular networks are rapidly adopting suitable network models for supporting packet data services. A key component of this packet data service model is quality of service (QoS), which is crucial for supporting disparate services envisioned in the future cellular networks. We describe the packet data QoS architecture and specific mechanisms that are being defined for multi-service QoS provisioning in the Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems.",

      "abstract": "This article discusses the problems arising when the TCP/IP protocol suite is used to provide Internet connectivity over existing and emerging wireless links. Due to the strong drive toward wireless Internet access through mobile terminals, these problems must be carefully studied in order to build improved systems. We review wireless link characteristics using wireless LANs and cellular communications systems as examples. We then outline the performance problems of the TCP/IP protocol suite when employed over those links, such as degraded TCP performance due to mistaking wireless errors for congestion. We present various proposals for solving these problems and examine their benefits and limitations. Finally, we consider the future evolution of wireless systems and the challenges that emerging systems will impose on the Internet protocol suite.",

The industry's response to the need for wire-speed packet processing devices whose function can be rapidly adapted to continuously changing standards and customer requirements is the concept of special programmable network processors. We discuss the prerequisites of processing tens to hundreds of millions of packets per second and indicate ways to achieve scalability through parallel packet processing. Tomorrow's switch fabrics, which will provide node-internal connectivity between the input and output ports of a router or switch, will have to sustain terabit-per-second throughput. After reviewing fundamental switching concepts, we discuss architectural and design issues that must be addressed to allow the evolution of packet switch fabrics to terabit-per-second throughput performance.",

Telecommunications was critical to its operations and the delivery of the Games to 3.5 billion viewers around the world. The main challenges included the design and operation of the highest-density mobile network in the world at Sydney Olympic Park and the provisioning of the necessary international links from a remote country of just 19 million people for a 17-day event. This article describes the various networks used to make possible this highly successful event.",

TIMIP is based on principles similar to those in the CIP and HAWAII architectures proposed at IETF and is equally suited for micromobility scenarios. With TIMIP, terminals with legacy IP stacks have the same degree of mobility as terminals with mobility-aware IP stacks. Nevertheless, it still uses MIP for macromobility scenarios. In order to support seamless handoff, TIMIP uses context-transfer mechanisms compatible with those currently in discussion at the IETF SeaMoby group.",

      "abstract": "Popular wireless networking protocols such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and HomeRF were originally developed for the 2.4 GHz frequency band by organizations that made design tradeoffs based on values such as complexity, price, and performance. Because the protocols were developed independently and these values differed according to the markets and applications the organizations intended to serve, the various protocols do not easily interoperate with one another and can cause significant mutual interference in the same radio space. The problem becomes especially acute in environments such as residential networks where a single network may be required to serve a broad range of application classes. A newer high-performance wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11a, operates in the 5 GHz band and offers much higher speeds than previous WLAN standards, but does not adequately provide for unified networks that support multiple classes of devices with differing speed, performance, power, complexity, and cost requirements. These differing classes of devices will become increasingly important as LANs move beyond the limits of office-oriented computer interconnection services and into the realm of data, video, and audio distribution services for interconnected devices in offices and homes. The 5 GHz unified protocol (5-UP/sup TM/) is a proposed extension to existing 5 GHz wireless LAN (WLAN) standards that supports data transfer rates to over 54 Mb/s and also allows a wide variety of lower-power lower-speed devices carrying diverse traffic types to coexist and interoperate within the same unified wireless network.",

      "abstract": "Telecommunication networks are experiencing a dramatic increase in demand for capacity, much of it related to the exponential takeup of the Internet and associated services. To support this demand economically, transport networks are evolving to provide a reconfigurable optical layer which, with optical cross-connects, will realize a high-bandwidth flexible core. As well as providing large capacity, this new layer will be required to support new services such as rapid provisioning of an end-to-end connection under customer control. The first phase of network evolution, therefore, will provide a circuit-switched optical layer characterized by high capacity and fast circuit provisioning. In the longer term, it is currently envisaged that the bandwidth efficiency associated with optical packet switching (a transport technology that matches the bursty nature of multimedia traffic) will be required to ensure economic use of network resources. This article considers possible network application scenarios for optical packet switching. In particular, it focuses on the concept of an optical packet router as an edge network device, functioning as an interface between the electronic and optical domains. In this application it can provide a scalable and efficient IP traffic aggregator that may provide greater flexibility and efficiency than an electronic terabit router with reduced cost. The discussion considers the main technical issues relating to the concept and its implementation.",

      "abstract": "The basic attribute of capacity, now extended by a series of technical innovations, has transformed the crude cable platform into a powerful network capable of supplying advanced broadband telecommunications services to consumers. The author provides an outline of the technical migration that has taken place in cable over the past 10 years. This evolution can be summarized in three steps: fiber, digital, and packets. The first major architectural step occurred in the late 1980s. Single-mode fiber provided a way to replace the string of trunk amplifiers that were the cause of quality and reliability problems in cable. If the composite signal carrying 30-100 TV channels could be delivered into the coaxial network near the home, the trunk amplifiers could be eliminated. The development of analog lasers that could be AM modulated with very broadband signals (and perform at useful signal to noise margins) enabled the addition of fiber to the cable infrastructure. The cable network migrated to the hybrid fiber coax (HFC) structure that uses fiber to deliver signals to neighborhood nodes. From the nodes, the signals are redistributed to homes using the tree and branch coaxial plant previously in place.",

      "abstract": "To be competitive in a rapidly growing market requires rapid upgrades to the performance and functionality of the network. One way to manage rapid upgrades of the network with minimum risk is to deploy equipment using a modular system architecture. Modularity allows a network operator to mix and match best of breed components to achieve the desired system rather than rely on vendors to implement specific technology before making crucial business decisions. This article begins with an overview of the current global movement toward standards that support network elements with modular system architecture. The story begins with university initiatives and the forming of OpenSig and IEEE P1520 more than five years ago, continuing with related and complementary initiatives by the Parlay Group, Softswitch Consortium, Multiservice Switching Forum, and several IETF working groups. Next, special attention is given to the component-based architecture of the Multiservice Switching Forum released in summer 2000. The trend of building network equipment from components with distinctly different functional specialties is described in three examples: media gateways, IP routers, and virtual IP routers. It is envisioned that component-based network infrastructure will spawn new markets for entrepreneurial developers, spurring competition and accelerating the creation of innovative solutions for all facets of global communications. The article concludes with a smorgasbord of new market opportunities.",

Starting from the various transmission media characteristics of all systems, the well-known twisted pair lines with their corresponding digital subscriber line services are evaluated against wireless local loops, communications over ubiquitous power lines, high-bandwidth cable modems, and mobile radio. Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages. The different technologies will find their fields of applications. Most networks will have to provide a mixture of solutions for individual subscribers and customer segments to meet their boundary conditions. As a result, the future of subscriber access is a hybrid solution.",

It covers current research, and describes major technical challenges, including networking, real-time services, and software. It shows that by their very nature, mobile ad hoc networks can bring a paradigm shift in the way networks are organized and operated, and can even lead to a fundamental change in the relationships between information technology and societal organization. As an illustration of these concepts, the article also contains an overall description of our long-term research project, called terminodes.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of wavelength-division multiplexing technology has led to a tremendous increase In the available transmission capacity in wide area networks. Consequently, these networks may no longer be limited by the transmission bandwidth, but rather by the processing capability of electronic switches, routers, and multiplexers in the network. This realization has led to a new wave of research aimed at overcoming the electronic bottleneck by providing optical bypass at the WDM layer. Traffic grooming can be used as a bypass mechanism by which low-rate circuits are assigned to wavelengths in order to minimize the amount of electronic multiplexing equipment. This topic has received a significant amount of attention in both the research and commercial arenas. We give an overview of the traffic grooming problem and survey some representative work in this area. While most work has focused on grooming in SONET rings, grooming traffic in general mesh networks is an important emerging problem.",

      "abstract": "We argue that traffic theory, an essential component in the design of traditional telecommunications networks, should be increasingly applied in the development of the multiservice Internet. We discuss the statistical characteristics of Internet traffic at different time scales. Modeling is facilitated on identifying the notion of flow and distinguishing the categories of streaming and elastic traffic. We review mathematical modeling approaches useful for predicting the relationship between demand, capacity and performance for both streaming and elastic flows. Derived results indicate the limitations of service differentiation as a means for guaranteeing QoS and highlight the importance of traditional traffic engineering approaches in ensuring that the network has sufficient capacity to handle offered demand.",

New-generation multimedia surveillance systems will be characterized by such key topics as distribution of processing capabilities among intelligent sensor and central processing levels, and dynamic reconfigurability of the wireless links thanks to innovative software radio technologies. In this work a joint analysis of such aspects is presented in order to provide optimal design strategies for new-generation multimedia surveillance networks, able to take into account the trade-offs between available computing and communications resources and required performance in terms of correct event detection and real-time processing.",

Over the past decade, the intelligent network has been used to support value-added services. New APIs are being designed for the creation of value-added services spanning multiple domains (wireline/wireless, voice/data, public/enterprise). These APIs will not only ease the development of value-added services, but will also open service creation to third parties.",

Data are stored and distributed decentrally, allowing multiple combinations of program objects to new programs. The virtual broadcast station is the network. This concept additionally offers the clients the opportunity to obtain an individual (personalized) program, still using bandwidth-economic multicast technologies. This is achieved by dividing multimedia streams into temporal chunks (chunk streams), streamed over different multicast host groups (distributed multicasting), using existing Internet session control protocols (SDP) and Internet transport protocols (RTP). A client application assembles the transmitted chunks to form an individual program. This technique can also be used to insert personal/local advertisements into broadcast-like services.",

      "abstract": "Voice over IP services have emerged as a low-cost alternative to PSTN voice service, and an attractive solution for voice/data integration in public and private networks. Satellite systems, as an integral part of the global communications infrastructure, already have an increasing portion of their capacities used to carry data packets, and with their global coverage and reach to remote areas are well positioned to enable growth of VoIP services. For VoIP over satellite, several issues need to be addressed. These include transmission and quality of service issues, as well as service-related issues such as service creation and customization, support of IN and supplementary services, and seamless integration with the PSTN. While the service-related aspects of VoIP are common to both terrestrial and satellite networks, transport-related issues are different. This article reports performance results of laboratory experiments for evaluating VoIP over satellite under different link and traffic conditions.",

      "abstract": "When looked at as a communication task, the watermarking process can be split into three main steps: watermark generation and embedding (information transmission), possible attacks (transmission through the channel), and watermark retrieval (information decoding at the receiver side). We review the main issues in watermark generation and embedding. By focusing on the case of image watermarking, we first discuss the choice of the image features the watermark is superimposed to. Then we consider watermark generation and the rule used to insert the watermark within the host features. By adopting again a communication perspective, some useful hints are given on the way the watermark should be shaped and inserted within the host document for increased robustness against attacks. Given that invisibility is one of the main requirements a watermark must satisfy, the way psycho-visual notions can be used to effectively hide the watermark within an image is carefully reviewed. Rather than insisting on the mathematical aspects of each of the above issues, the main rationale behind the most commonly adopted approaches is given, as well as some illustrative examples.",

      "abstract": "LMDS is currently a promising emerging technology in broadband fixed wireless communications. The cellular structure, high data rates, and flexibility make it perfect for multimedia, digital television, and interactive services. These high-bandwidth multimedia services received most of the research attention until lately. There has been a clear gap when considering UDP/TCP/IP and other data services over LMDS. We examine the ramifications of using standard TCP/IP data communication over a two-layer LMDS system. We argue that the former emphasis only on multimedia and ATM-based communication over LMDS was a mistake. The most exciting prospect for LMDS should be in the role of enabling Internet and data services together with multimedia. We introduce a basic architecture for two-layer IP-LMDS based on a trial network built between 1996 and 2000.",

Wireless LAN access technology provides a perfect broadband complement for the operators' existing GSM and GPRS services in an indoor environment. Most commercial public wireless LAN solutions have only modest authentication and roaming capability compared to traditional cellular networks. This article describes a new wireless LAN system architecture that combines the WLAN radio access technology with mobile operators' SIM-based subscriber management functions and roaming infrastructure. In the defined system the WLAN access is authenticated and charged using GSM SIM. This solution supports roaming between cellular and WLAN access networks and is the first step toward an all-IP network architecture. The proto-type has been implemented and publicly verified in a real mobile operator network.",

      "abstract": "At the start of the 21st century, the wireless mobile markets are witnessing unprecedented growth fueled by an information explosion and a technology revolution. In the radio frequency arena, the trend is to move from narrowband to wideband with a family of standards tailored to a variety of application needs. Many enabling technologies including wideband code-division multiple access, software-defined radio, intelligent antennas, and digital processing devices are greatly improving the spectral efficiency of third-generation systems. In the mobile network area, the trend is to move from traditional circuit-switched systems to packet-switched programmable networks that integrate both voice and packet services, and eventually evolve toward an all-IP network. Furthermore, accompanied by wireless mobile location technology, wireless mobile Internet is expected to revolutionize the services that can be provided to consumers in the right place and at the right time. Wireless mobile communications may not only complement the well established wireline network; it may also become a serious competitor in years to come. We review the history of the wireless mobile communications, examine the current progress in standards and technologies, and discuss possible trends for wireless mobile solutions.",
