    "abstract": "The multi-level graph drawing is a popular approach to visualize large and complex graphs. It recursively coarsens a graph and then uncoarsens the drawing using layout refinement. In this paper, we leverage the Louvain community detection algorithm for the multi-level graph drawing paradigm.More specifically, we present the Louvain-based multi-level graph drawing algorithm, and compare with other community detection algorithms such as Label Propagation and Infomap clustering. Experiments show that Louvain-based multi-level algorithm performs best in terms of efficiency (i.e., fastest runtime), while Label Propagation and Infomap-based multi-level algorithms perform better in terms of effectiveness (i.e., better visualization in quality metrics).",

    "title": "Towards Unambiguous Edge Bundling: Investigating Confluent Drawings for Network Visualization",
    "author": "Benjamin Bach; Nathalie Henry Riche",
    "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7539373",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate Confluent Drawings (CD), a technique for bundling edges in node-link diagrams based on network connectivity. Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, CDs are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity.",

    "author": "R.G.J. Wijnhoven; P.H.N. de With",
    "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9438796",
    "abstract": "Training datasets for object detection problems are typically very large and Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementations are computationally complex. As opposed to these complex techniques, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms that use only a single new training sample in each iteration and process samples in a stream-like fashion. We have incorporated SGD optimization in an object detection framework. The object detection problem is typically highly asymmetric, because of the limited variation in object appearance, compared to the background. Incorporating SGD speeds up the optimization process significantly, requiring only a single iteration over the training set to obtain results comparable to state-of-the-art SVM techniques. SGD optimization is linearly scalable in time and the obtained speedup in computation time is two to three orders of magnitude. We show that by considering only part of the total training set, SGD converges quickly to the overall optimum.",

    "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8419285",
    "abstract": "A popular method of force-directed graph drawing is multidimensional scaling using graph-theoretic distances as input. We present an algorithm to minimize its energy function, known as stress, by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to move a single pair of vertices at a time. Our results show that SGD can reach lower stress levels faster and more consistently than majorization, without needing help from a good initialization. We then show how the unique properties of SGD make it easier to produce constrained layouts than previous approaches. We also show how SGD can be directly applied within the sparse stress approximation of Ortmann et al. [1], making the algorithm scalable up to large graphs.",
